Foreign   North Korean Leader Says He Wants Better Ties With South. Advertisement Advertisement By CHOE SANG-HUNDEC. 31, 2013 SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on Wednesday called for improving relations with South Korea and boasted of his regime’s tightened grip on power in his first public speech since the purge and execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, last month. “North and South Korea should create a mood to improve relations,” Mr. Kim said in a nationally televised New Year’s Day speech. “It’s time to end useless slandering, and the North and the South should no longer do things that harm reconciliation and harmony.” Mr. Kim began delivering a New Year’s Day speech after coming to power two years ago, reviving the practice of his grandfather Kim Il-sung. During the rule of his reclusive father, Kim Jong-il, the country’s main state-run newspapers issued a joint editorial to mark the day. Analysts waited for this year’s speech with unusual interest because it would be the first since the purge of Mr. Jang, long considered Mr. Kim’s mentor and the regime’s No. 2 figure. Mr. Jang was executed on Dec. 12 on charges of building a faction within the ruling Workers’ Party in a plot to overthrow Mr. Kim’s government. “We took decisive actions to remove factional filth,” Mr. Kim said Wednesday in an apparent reference to the purge of Mr. Jang and his associates. “Our party has tightened its revolutionary ranks by making a timely decision to ferret out and purge the anti-party, anti-revolutionary factional clique.” Advertisement The purge was the biggest political upheaval in North Korea in recent years. Some analysts have said it indicated the further consolidation of Mr. Kim’s rule. But others speculated that he had failed to establish the kind of absolute authority that his father and grandfather wielded and that the purge signaled a power struggle in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. South Korean policy-makers have warned that North Korea may attempt military provocations against the South to build internal unity after the domestic political trouble. In his speech, Mr. Kim repeated his government’s traditional condemnation of the United States and South Korea for conducting war games on the divided Korean Peninsula. The exercises “created a situation where a trifle military skirmish can spread into a full-blown war,” he said. “If there is another war on this land, it will bring about a nuclear catastrophe, and the United States won’t escape it, either.” Mr. Kim had also called for an end to “confrontation” with South Korea during his last New Year speech, after his country launched a rocket in December 2012. Washington condemned it as a test of long-range missile technology. Mr. Kim’s government further raised tensions by conducting its third underground nuclear test in February. In most of the first half of 2013, the North issued a torrent of threats of missile and nuclear attacks at South Korea, the United States and its bases around the Pacific. But it has since expressed a willingness to re-engage in dialogue. Under Mr. Kim, North Korea adopted the simultaneous development of the economy and the nuclear weapons program as a key party line. Yet years of tightening sanctions have made reviving the moribund economy even harder. South Korean intelligence officials said Mr. Jang’s purge was partly the result of a factional struggle over the spoils of the country’s few sources of foreign currency, like exports of coal. On Wednesday, Mr. Kim echoed the themes of previous New Year messages, emphasizing that improving the living standards of North Koreans and rejuvenating agriculture were main priorities. But he also reiterated a call for strengthening the military through the development of advanced weapons like drones. North Korea has often called for improved ties with the South in its New Year messages. It hopes for the return of billions of dollars of South Korean investment, aid and trade, which had flowed during an era of reconciliation between 1998 and 2008. South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, a conservative, says her nation will not provide aid until the North wins the South’s “trust” by moving toward denuclearization.

Science   Navigating Our World Like Birds and Bees Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. African tribesmen walk through their landscape in a pattern that eerily echoes the movements of scavenging birds, flocking insects, gliding sharks and visitors to Disneyland, a new study finds, suggesting that aspects of how we choose to move around in our world are deeply hard-wired. For the new study, which appeared online recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Arizona at Tucson, Yale University, the New York Consortium in Evolutionary Primatology and other institutions traveled to northern Tanzania to study the Hadza, who are among the last human hunter-gatherers on earth. The Hadza generally spend their days following game and foraging for side dishes and condiments such as desert tubers and honey, frequently walking and jogging for miles in the process. The ways in which creatures, including people, navigate their world is a topic of considerable scientific interest, but one that, until the advent of global positioning systems and similar tracking technology, was difficult to quantify. In the past decade, however, scientists have begun strapping GPS units to many varieties of animals and insects, from bumblebees to birds, and measuring how they move. What they have found is that when moving with a purpose such as foraging for food, many creatures follow a particular and shared pattern. They walk (or wing or lope) for a short time in one direction, scouring the ground for edibles, then turn and start moving in another direction for a short while, before turning and strolling or flying in another direction yet again. This is a useful strategy for finding tubers and such, but if maintained indefinitely brings creatures back to the same starting point over and over; they essentially move in circles. So most foragers and predators occasionally throw in a longer-distance walk (or flight), which researchers refer to as a “long step,” bringing them into new territory, where they then return to short walks and frequent turns as they explore the new place. This particular motion pattern was first scientifically identified in 1999 among scavenging albatrosses and termed a Levy flight or walk (named, for obscure reasons, after Paul Levy, a French mathematician). Since then, researchers have discerned the same pattern in bumblebees, sharks, fly fishermen trawling a river and people at amusement parks, who sample one portion of the facility in depth before ambling off to remoter rides. But while the pattern was instinctual in animals and insects, it was not clear whether Levy-style movement was natural to humans or occurred in modern times almost by happenstance, because of how we built our cities and amusement parks. So the scientists turned to the Hadza, who still live much as humans did millennia ago. They outfitted 44 of the tribespeople with GPS watches and asked them to hunt and gather for several days while wearing the units. The resulting data showed that the tribespeople frequently employed the Levy walk, moving briefly in one direction, then shifting and covering nearby ground, until that area was exhausted of potential food, at which point they’d set off on a longer-distance hike to new ground and there begin the short explorations again. This finding has surprising relevance, even for those of us whose food is arrayed in grocery aisles, said David Raichlen, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona who led the study. The GPS readings reinforce the likelihood that Levy-style walking patterns are hard-wired into the human brain and predict how we behave. Even before this study was published, he said, planners in some cities had used the theory that people Levy-walk — spending much of their time exploring one area, with occasional “long steps” or forays into another part of a city — to determine where to place cellphone towers. At a more individual level, he said, the discovery may help to explain why, after spending hours in a small, familiar office, many of us feel an itch to wander the halls in search of new geography. But the most resonant implication of the study, Dr. Raichlen said, is that Levy walking patterns bind modern, urban humans to the natural world. “This pattern” of movement “emerges so often in so many different species and human societies,” he said. “It links us” to the flight of the albatross and to an ancient part of ourselves, even when we’re strolling toward Disney’s Tomorrowland.

Business   Talk Radio on WABC Shifts Focus to the Local. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN SISARIOJAN. 2, 2014 In the war over talk radio in New York, WABC is going local. WABC-AM (770), which is owned by Cumulus Media, will introduce a new lineup on Thursday that emphasizes live and local programming, as its two most popular hosts, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, move to a rival station, WOR-AM (710). Weekday programming at WABC will include the return of Curtis Sliwa’s and Ron Kuby’s show, “Curtis and Kuby,” from noon to 3 p.m., after an absence of more than six years, and, starting Monday, a one-hour program at 5 p.m. with Pat Kiernan, the NY1 television anchor. Geraldo Rivera, who joined WABC in early 2012, will turn his focus to New York news in a two-hour live show at 10 a.m., as Cumulus announced in November. Michael Savage’s syndicated program, which has been heard in the evenings, will now run from 3 to 5 p.m. “Imus in the Morning,” with Don Imus, will continue from 6 to 10 a.m. “We’re delivering on our pledge to invest in localized content that will entertain, inform and engage listeners while also providing advertisers unique opportunities to reach their customers on a sustained basis,” John Dickey, Cumulus’s co-chief operating officer, said in a statement. The changes come as Cumulus tries to build its programming chest to compete against Clear Channel, whose 850 stations include WOR. Once a small player in the radio industry, Cumulus expanded greatly in 2011 when it bought Citadel Broadcasting for $2.5 billion, and it now operates about 460 stations. Advertisement Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Hannity, whose shows are syndicated to hundreds of stations by Clear Channel’s Premiere Networks division, are by far the country’s most popular talk hosts, and their combined presence helped make WABC the dominant talk outlet in New York. Talkers, a trade magazine, estimates that Mr. Limbaugh reaches more than 14 million listeners each week and Mr. Hannity 13.25 million. Last year, however, Cumulus executives said millions of dollars were lost after advertisers withdrew from the shows, largely in response to Mr. Limbaugh’s ridicule of Sandra Fluke, an advocate of insurance coverage for birth control. Mr. Limbaugh’s and Mr. Hannity’s shows left WABC at the end of 2013 as a result of complex negotiations between Cumulus and Clear Channel. Mr. Hannity’s show was dropped from dozens of Cumulus stations, while the syndication contract for Mr. Limbaugh was renewed at most stations, but discontinued at WABC. In New York, their shows are now heard on WOR. “Curtis and Kuby,” which ran on WABC from 2000 to late 2007, will now compete against Mr. Limbaugh, and Mr. Savage’s show will be up against Mr. Hannity. While none of the new figures on WABC have followings on the scale of WOR’s syndicated hosts, Cumulus is betting on the appeal of locally focused content to draw New York listeners. Mr. Kiernan, who is on NY1 each weekday morning, said his show, which will include a co-host who has not been named, would be a recap of the major news and pop culture events of the day. He also emphasized the importance of local programming on the radio, as stations compete not only against one another but also against an ocean of media online. “In an era when listeners can go off in so many different directions,” Mr. Kiernan said, “local is something you can’t take away from people.” A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2014, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Talk Radio on WABC Shifts to Local.

Foreign   Delhi’s New Chief Minister Strikes a Chord With the People. Advertisement Advertisement By MANU JOSEPHJAN. 2, 2014 NEW DELHI — In Delhi’s winter, the practicality of warm clothes ensures that even the poor do not seem as austere as they do in other seasons. But the capital’s new chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, has somehow managed to maintain his perennial simplicity even at the risk of looking somewhat ridiculous. Part of his attire this winter is a scarf below his customary white oval cap. A comment on my Facebook page described him as looking like an Emirates flight attendant. But the nation is fascinated by him. Never before in modern India have the elite and the poor agreed on a political matter, but now there is a consensus that Mr. Kejriwal is a hero of these times. Long an agitator who chiefly targeted political corruption, he contested the Delhi state elections, and on Saturday was sworn in as its seventh chief minister. He rode the subway to the swearing-in ceremony. He has declined state security cover and the sprawling official residence. His Aam Admi Party, or A.A.P., which had initially planned to contest about 100 of the 545 seats in the impending general elections to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is now considering contesting about 300 seats. The previous general elections, in 2009, were contested by more than 350 political parties representing scores of regional, communal and social interests. The strategy of A.A.P. is to be the mother ship of numerous citizens’ pressure groups and mass movements across the country. It plans to broaden its mission beyond fighting political corruption and endear itself to those who want to cast a vote against a variety of government policies. Mr. Kejriwal’s triumph is a point in time in the evolution of both elite and mass protests in India, an evolution that has been accelerated by economics, technology and the intoxicating comforts of feudalism, which have long ensured that the rich, in many ways, have a better life in India than in developed nations. These factors have resulted in the urban middle class becoming increasingly interested in the nation’s political destiny. As recently as 2007, there was something comical about how the urban Indian middle class protested. They usually carried sunblock and stood holding placards in English. It was as if they were not protesting so much as talking to each other. Mass protests, at the time, were festive outings with jovial protesters often waving to television cameras. There were also, of course, very serious protests by the poor, but their marches seldom interested the mainstream news media. Advertisement But something else was going on. The middle-class enchantment with escaping to the affluent West was coming to an end. Even as India’s elite was prospering, the West was going through hard times. Then, in 2008, 10 terrorists from Pakistan attacked South Mumbai, a refuge of the rich. Mumbai’s elite erupted in anger, blaming the politicians they criticized as not being competent enough to protect them. When a politician came to pay his respects to the dead, he was driven away by a group of college students. This was unprecedented in Mumbai. In the general elections that followed, Meera Sanyal, a banker whose close friend had died in the attack, ran as a candidate from the Mumbai South constituency. Ms. Sanyal received extraordinary media coverage, and was impressive when she spoke of her plans, but she fared poorly in the election. It appeared that the educated urban middle class would never be able to influence Indian politics, even with the news media on its side. The middle-class revolt revived in 2011 as the global economy sank further. After a series of high-profile political scandals and a mass movement against the political class, Mr. Kejriwal emerged as a hero of the poor and the miserable. He was a beneficiary of middle-class anger against politicians, and the news media made him a national figure, but his success lay in realizing that the voters, who are mostly poor, mattered more.

Science   Lentil and Carrot Salad With Middle Eastern Spices. Advertisement Advertisement Recipes for Health By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN DEC. 30, 2013 I combined two of my favorite Mediterranean salads to stretch the cup of lentils I had in my pantry. Take care not to overcook the lentils; they should be slightly al dente. They go quickly from al dente to mushy, so make sure to check after 25 minutes. 1 cup brown or green lentils, washed and picked over 1 bay leaf Salt to taste 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 to 3 large garlic cloves (to taste), minced 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground 3/4 teaspoon coriander seeds, ground 1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds, ground 3/4 pound carrots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1. Place the lentils in a medium saucepan, cover by 1 inch with water, add the bay leaf and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste, reduce the heat and cook just until the lentils are al dente, about 25 minutes. Advertisement 2. Meanwhile, combine 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic in a small frying pan or saucepan over medium heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle, add the spices. Stir together for about 30 seconds, then remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. 3. While the lentils are simmering, steam the carrots for 8 to 10 minutes, until tender. Remove from the heat and transfer to the bowl with the garlic and spices. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste and toss together. 4. When the lentils are cooked al dente, set a strainer over a bowl, drain the lentils and toss at once with the carrots. If desired, add some of the broth to moisten. Add cilantro and another tablespoon of olive oil and toss together. Add freshly ground pepper, taste and adjust salt.

Travel   A Winter Weekend in the North Fork. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 2, 2014 It’s free to watch the sun set over the wetlands that fringe the causeway connecting East Marion and Orient, near the eastern tip of Long Island’s North Fork. If the weather has been dry enough in this wine country just across the bay from the Hamptons, there’s a good perch on the marshy land near Latham Farms, by a little cabin on stilts known locally as the crab shack. The wine is also free, if your friend Jeanny Pak happens to have brought along a bottle of malbec and some plastic cups without telling you. There’s only one catch: sunsets tend to take place right around nightfall, which means you’ll also need a place to sleep. The price for that can vary widely over the course of a year in a spot this seasonal. The Greenporter Hotel in cute little Greenport Village, for example, charges $119 plus tax ($133) for its cheapest room on winter weekends; in July 2014, it will be $309 plus tax ($345). Affordable lodging and a lack of crowds were my primary motivations for heading to the East End on a winter weekend. And something about the Yelp reviews made me suspect I was going to like the Greenporter: “Dumpy motel lying and masquerading as a boutique hotel.” “About as much charm as a white padded room.” “I mean, come on guys, not for nearly $300 a night.” There, in that last one, did you catch it? Fussy online hotel reviews are easy enough for unfussy travelers like me to ignore; when the reviewers paid more than twice what you plan to, they mean practically nothing at all. In fact Jeanny, whom I invited as stand-in girlfriend in part because she has far higher standards than I, had no complaints — the overhauled former motel had a decent bed, working Internet and a bathroom with a timed heater (great for winter mornings). Just a clean, private room with hot water is generally enough for me; a flat-screen TV and a front desk that printed out hiking paths (and later, promptly mailed back an item left behind) were bonuses. There’s even a smidgen of style — a whitewash treatment alone is enough to transform the vibe from old to retro — and a decent free breakfast. Sure, if I had paid $345, I’d expect a lot more — like to be fired from this column for dereliction of duty. You also don’t need a car to get there — it’s a five-minute walk from the Greenport Long Island Rail Road and Hampton Jitney bus stop. Jeanny had driven us out there early Saturday morning, but she left early Sunday; I would stay for the day and take one of the frequent jitneys back, $19 to Manhattan. Advertisement Heading to a summer spot in the winter, of course, has its downsides. You can’t jump in the water and for after-dark excitement, you’ll have to turn to a John Grisham novel. But lines are nonexistent, and service tends to be impeccable, as you’ve got the full attention of servers and hotel clerks. Advertisement Having a car does have its advantages; if we hadn’t driven, we wouldn’t have stopped for an early lunch at Taqueria Mexico in Riverhead, the last town before Long Island splits. One thing you can count on from wealthy vacation areas is restaurants for immigrant workers somewhere on the periphery. Jeanny began her Frugal Traveler career by absolutely schooling me on ordering: she ordered one chicken tostada ($2) and asked our diminutive Guatemalan server to add beef to a $1.50 meatless tostada, for which we were charged an extra 50 cents. (My $8 order of three pathetic bean and cheese sopes for $8 was half as good for twice the price.) Once lodging is taken care of, the only danger of blowing the budget in the North Fork is the temptation of the pricey, local-ingredient-obsessed restaurants. Having sensed danger on the drive out when Jeanny had asked, “Where are we having dinner?” I decided to forestall any evening splurges with a snack-as-we-went approach. There were those tostadas, a $4 bag of six still-warm cider doughnuts at Wickham’s Fruit Farm (now closed for the season), three homemade pickles for $3 at Goodale Farms and a portion of black bean and grass-fed beef chili with blue corn tortilla chips for $10 from the food truck behind the fancy North Fork Table & Inn. In between, we fit in a visit to Horton’s Point Lighthouse (though you can’t enter in the winter), a walk on a nearby beach and a wine tasting at Lenz Winery, which we split for a $10 and which included four wines, including its well-regarded gewürztraminer. Once again beating me at my own game, Jeanny managed to weasel a fifth taste out of our server. We tried to go see the sunset from Orient Beach State Park, which hangs by a ligament off the tip of the North Fork, but the park closed at 4; a worker there directed us to the causeway, which turned out to be perfect. The evening was young, but night life expectancy is short during North Fork winters, so after dropping off our bags, we hurried over to catch the tail end of the 5 to 7 p.m. weekend happy hour at the Winemaker Studio in Peconic, a combination tasting room, bar and wine shop. Pours were 30 percent off, and we took advantage, ordering normally $7 glasses of a blend of reds from Suhru Wines in Mattituck. On advice from our server, we decided to end the evening with a drink at the bar at First and South, a fancy-ish restaurant back in Greenport. We found a cozy little small town bar scene there; we chatted up a local English teacher and got filled in on the honors curriculum at Riverhead High School, from Shakespeare to Elie Wiesel. (Jeanny and I first met as teachers in the 1990s, so we were actually quite interested.) I was a little worried we’d be tempted to eat from the pricey restaurant menu, so, along with a beer, I ordered what turned out to be the best deal on the menu, the $8 chowder loaded with smoked cod and apple wood bacon. Jeanny went rogue and ordered a shockingly insubstantial salad ($9 for “biodynamic” greens) and a bemusingly priced order of fries ($8). She would be paying for those herself. When Jeanny drove off the next morning, I set out to see just what was within walking distance of Greenport Village. (My plan was aided by some unseasonably balmy December weather.) Quite a bit, it turned out. A list of hiking trails the hotel gave me included paths in Inlet Pond County Park, just off Long Island Sound and about a one and half mile walk north. A Google Maps route sent me over back roads where traffic was limited to flitting robins, black-capped chickadees and the occasional cardinal. Its chosen route into the park, however, led through someone’s backyard and into what looked to be thick woods. After asking for directions, I looped around Sound Drive to just where the park met the water. But a gate and sign — “Private Beach” — stopped me. I was confused: How can a private beach be connected to a public park? But ever since a farmer in Arkansas scolded me for stepping onto his property to take an Instagram photo of some bales of hay, I’ve been averse to even seemingly harmless property rights violations. So I headed off-road, thrashing into the bramble that lay inside the park, catching my pants on thorns and wishing I had a machete. Advertisement Soon, though, I hit a trail, which looped around lovely Inlet Pond and, on several occasions, spurs that led right onto the beach. (So much for private.) Perhaps the walk would have been more traditionally lovely in the spring, but I quite liked the skeletal trees and windblown marsh grasses that gave it barren and blustery look. I came out at the trailhead Google Maps should have led me to in the first place, at a red house on Route 48 used by the North Fork Audubon Society. From there, it was an easy walk to Kontokosta Winery, just north of downtown Greenport on a bluff over the Sound. The long driveway through the vineyards themselves toward the tasting room — a rather regal-looking barn — makes for a dramatic approach. I’ll defer judgment on the wines to a more educated palate, but the servers were quite pleasant and the tasting (along with a walk out to the bluff) was certainly worth $10. It was not as good a deal, however, as the spot where I ended the trip after wandering through galleries and shops in town. North Fork tastings are not all about wine: at the Greenport Harbor Brewing Company, $8 gets you three ounces of each of seven beers — for a total of more than an English pint. I fell for the hoppy Other Side IPA, as well as for several of the very cute dogs hanging out in what turned out to be a canine-friendly, jam-packed local hangout. What it’s like in the summer, when it must fill with city folk, I have no idea — and, come to think of it, not much desire to find out.

Advertisement Advertisement By RAVI SOMAIYAJAN. 2, 2014 Ezra Klein, an analyst, columnist and television commentator who runs The Washington Post’s Wonkblog, is making plans to leave the newspaper after failing to win support for a new website he wanted to create within the company, according to four people with knowledge of the negotiations. Mr. Klein, who quickly ascended into the ranks of the Washington media establishment with a multiplatform blend of policy nuance and number-crunching on Wonkblog, approached Katharine Weymouth, the Post’s publisher, in recent weeks, the people said. After consultation with the newspaper’s editor, Marty Baron, according to one of the people, he put forward a proposal with detailed revenue projections to build a new website dedicated to explanatory journalism on a wide range of topics beyond political policy. It would have been affiliated with The Post, the person said, but would have been a separate enterprise. The investment he sought, the person said, was in eight figures. Ms. Weymouth and the paper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, declined to support the project. Since then, Mr. Klein has had discussions with several potential investors and venture capitalists in an effort to start the website himself, said those with knowledge of his plans, who insisted on anonymity in discussing them. Though the atmosphere within The Post was described as civilized, one person said, there has been some awkwardness. Still, it is possible that Mr. Klein could remain at The Post if talks about his plans were rekindled. As 2013 drew to a close, Neil Irwin, the economics editor of Wonkblog, joined The New York Times. Mr. Klein has been on vacation in San Francisco. Both declined to comment, as did The Washington Post. Advertisement The Washington Post owns the name Wonkblog, said a person with knowledge of the arrangement, and could continue it even without Mr. Klein. News of Mr. Klein’s proposal for a new website was first reported by The Huffington Post. Several other journalists who had seen their brands grow at big media organizations have left to expand on their own. Nate Silver, widely lauded for the data analysis that led to his accurate prediction of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, left The Times in 2013 to build his own site, backed by ESPN. Walter S. Mossberg and Kara Swisher, who first came to prominence at The Wall Street Journal with their technology reporting and then built the AllThingsD technology news site and conference business, announced in the fall they were striking out on their own. They secured minority investment, renamed their site ReCode, and left Dow Jones officially this week. In an interview about that move earlier this week, Ms. Swisher said that they had decided against working in a large media company because “there is a lot of competition for resources, and there isn’t always the same willingness to take risks.” Mr. Klein is also a policy analyst for MSNBC, where he sometimes fills in for other hosts, and he writes for Bloomberg View. He is married to Annie Lowrey, a Times reporter. Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the columnist Ezra Klein’s plans to leave The Washington Post, where he directs the popular Wonkblog, misspelled the given name of the newspaper’s publisher in some copies. She is Katharine Weymouth, not Katherine. A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2014, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Blogger Said to Plan to Leave The Post.

Foreign   Prime Minister Rules Out Third Term. Advertisement NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Friday that he would not be India’s next prime minister if the Congress Party-led United Progressive Alliance wins the national elections scheduled for this spring. “In a few months’ time, after the general election, I will hand the baton over to a new prime minister,” Mr. Singh said. “I hope it will be a U.P.A.-chosen prime minister, and our party will work to that end in the campaign for the general elections.” The prime minister also expressed his support for Rahul Gandhi, vice president of the Congress Party and scion of the powerful Gandhi family, as the party’s choice for the post of prime minister in the national elections. “Rahul Gandhi has outstanding credentials to be nominated, and I hope our party will take the decision at an appropriate time,” said Mr. Singh. At his first formal news conference since 2011, Mr. Singh defended a battered central government, which has faced serious allegations of corruption and inaction over the last decade, by calmly listing the achievements during his two terms, which now span nearly 10 years. He said the governing coalition has made efforts to combat corruption and initiate investigations after the government was accused of fraudulently allotting wireless phone licenses and coal fields to business groups. . “We have taken major steps to change the existing procedures for allocation of spectrum and coal by shifting to auctions so that these problems do not arise in future,” said Mr. Singh. “Where some decisions taken earlier, when allocations were made administratively, have come under question, they are being investigated,” he said. The scandals and a stagnant economy have taken a toll on the Congress Party’s fortunes at the polls. In recent state assembly elections, the party was routed in four states and managed to retain power only in the northeastern state of Mizoram. Congress’s main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., retained power in the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and wrested the state of Rajasthan from the Congress Party. The B.J.P. also finished with the most number of seats in the city-state of Delhi with 31, while the Congress Party was reduced from 43 seats to eight. Mr. Singh’s strongest words were reserved for Narendra Modi, chief minister of Gujarat and the B.J.P.’s prime ministerial candidate. After a journalist asked Mr. Singh whether his party was responsible for his image as a weak prime minister, Mr. Singh said he did not believe that he had been an ineffectual leader and that it was up to the historians to judge him. “If by strong prime minister you mean that you preside over the mass massacre of innocent citizens in the streets of Ahmedabad, that is a measure of strength I don’t think this country needs, least of all, in its prime minister,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the violent riots that occurred in Gujarat in 2002 while Mr. Modi was the state’s chief minister. Mr. Singh added that he sincerely believed it would be disastrous for the country to have Mr. Modi as its prime minister. Rajnath Singh, president of the B.J.P., called the prime minister’s remarks unfortunate. “Narendra Modi was a leader who transformed Gujarat into a model state through development and progress, and saying that the country will go into ruins if he becomes the prime minister is very laughable,” the B.J.P. president told reporters. What happened in 2002 was a tragedy, he said, but he noted that both the Supreme Court and the court’s special investigation team cleared Mr. Modi of any responsibility for the riots. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Are Sugary Drinks Fattening? Depends Who You Ask Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Are there good scientific studies that show that drinking sugar-sweetened soda increases the risk for obesity? The answer may vary depending on who is paying for the study. Researchers examined 17 large reviews of the subject (one review assessed results for adults and children separately, so there were 18 sets of study conclusions). Six of the studies reported receiving funds from industry groups, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and others. The other 12 reviews claimed no conflicts of interest. The analysis appears in the December issue of PLOS Medicine. Among the reviews with no conflicts of interest, 10 of 12, or 83.3 percent, reported that sugary drinks were directly associated with weight gain or obesity. The conclusions of studies supported by industry were a mirror image: five of six — the same 83.3 percent — reported that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. “I wouldn’t say that industry participation alone is enough to dismiss the study’s results in the whole of nutrition research,” said the lead author, Maira Bes-Rastrollo, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Navarra in Spain. “But I think that the general public and the scientific community should be aware that the food industry has vested interests that may influence their conclusions.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/07/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Awareness: Assessing Sugary Drinks Fairly.

Sports   N.F.L. Wild-Card Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 3, 2014 Chiefs (11-5) at Colts (11-5)  4:35 p.m. Saturday Line: Colts by 2 The last time Kansas City won a playoff game, in January 1994, Joe Montana was the quarterback. He outdueled Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers with the help of Marcus Allen. Linebacker Derrick Thomas sacked Moon twice that day. If those names do not indicate how much time has passed, then perhaps this will drive home point: The No. 1 song that year was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. In the 20 years since, the Chiefs have never been truly relevant. But for the first nine games this season, the Chiefs were unbeatable. Quarterback Alex Smith was providing the stable, efficient skills that he honed in his last two seasons in San Francisco, Jamaal Charles was among the N.F.L.’s best running backs, and the defense was punishing opposing quarterbacks with a fearsome front seven. Then Kansas City largely fell apart, going 2-5 the rest of the way. Even the expected return of Justin Houston, the team’s best pass rusher, is offset by the potential for Tamba Hali, his partner in sacks, to miss the game with a knee injury. Indianapolis would be particularly vulnerable to the Chiefs at full strength, as pass protection has been an issue in Andrew Luck’s first two seasons. But in Week 16, the short-handed Chiefs sacked him only once and they lost, 23-7. The red-hot Colts will do everything they can to recreate that result. Advertisement Pick: Colts Saints (11-5) at Eagles (10-6) 8:10 p.m. Saturday Line: Eagles by 3 The funny thing about having an extreme home-field advantage is how little it means when a road game comes along. For New Orleans, which thrives in its raucous indoor atmosphere, playing away from home was an issue even before the Superdome was built. As a franchise, the Saints are 0-5 in road playoff games. The current team was no better than its predecessors during the regular season, going 3-5 on the road with the Drew Brees-led offense averaging 17.8 points a game. At home, the Saints were 8-0, scoring an average of 34 points a game. New Orleans needs its offense to figure out a way to win not only outside, but also in extreme cold. The forecast for Philadelphia called for temperatures in the low 20s. The Eagles offense is so dynamic that Nick Foles came off the bench to lead the league in quarterback rating and managed to overshadow LeSean McCoy, who led everyone in rushing yards by a wide margin. McCoy had 1,607 yards on the ground, and his closest competition was Chicago’s Matt Forte at 1,339. Keeping the game interesting will be Philadelphia’s subpar secondary, which allowed an N.F.L.-worst 289.8 passing yards a game and will give Brees at least a small chance of overcoming his team’s road woes. Pick: Eagles Chargers (9-7) at Bengals (11-5) 1:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Bengals by 7 Five players who appeared on the Cincinnati roster this season were not born the last time the Bengals won a playoff game, including Giovani Bernard, the dynamic rookie running back. But they are heavy favorites against San Diego, which defied the odds by qualifying for the playoffs on the season’s final day. The Chargers had help from the Bengals, whose win over the Ravens eliminated the competition. Philip Rivers was on fire at the end of the season, spurring San Diego by passing for 845 passing yards and nine touchdowns over the last four games. But winning on a cold Sunday afternoon in Cincinnati will be a tall order. The Bengals were tough at home this season, going 8-0 and shutting down Ben Roethlisberger, Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck and Joe Flacco. Cincinnati was also more of a force on offense, with Andy Dalton seeming to come into his own in his third season and throwing for a career-high 33 touchdowns. Despite his propensity for turnovers — his 20 interceptions were the most among playoff quarterbacks — he did enough to help out the Bengals’ stellar defense. Advertisement For the Chargers to win on the road, Rivers will need to continue his hot streak and their secondary, which struggled for most of the season, will have to play an uncharacteristically perfect game. Pick: Bengals 49ers (12-4) at Packers (8-7-1)  4:40 p.m. Sunday Line: 49ers by 3 These teams matched up in perhaps the most anticipated playoff game last season. This time the expectations are somewhat tempered because Green Bay barely managed a winning record and San Francisco’s offense looks much less explosive. All eyes will be on 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who ran for a playoff-record 181 yards against the Packers, then flipped the script, passing for 412 yards in this season’s Week 1 victory. The only thing left for him to do is to beat the Packers as a receiver. The season opener, however, was one of the few moments when Kaepernick provided the same level of excitement and production that he did in his breakout run to Super Bowl XLVII. He was still a force on offense with his arm and his legs, but Kaepernick occasionally struggled with accuracy and decision-making, leading to long scoring droughts. San Francisco, the preseason favorite in the N.F.C., looked like a second-class citizen compared with division rival Seattle. Kaepernick has been hot in the 49ers’ current six-game winning streak, and he should have plenty of motivation in facing his favorite opponent — and favorite team growing up. The conditions will be harsh, but San Francisco, with Frank Gore and Kaepernick, has the ability to grind out a game on the ground. If Eddie Lacy is not at full speed, the pass-happy Packers may find themselves grounded at home. Pick: 49ers Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.

Business   George Goodman, Who Demystified the World of Money, Dies at 83. Advertisement Advertisement By DOUGLAS MARTINJAN. 3, 2014 George J. W. Goodman, who demystified financial complexities in best-selling books and on a long-running public television program under the name of one of history’s most famous economists, Adam Smith, died on Friday in Miami. He was 83. The cause was complications of leukemia, his son, Mark, said. Mr. Goodman helped start Institutional Investor magazine in the 1960s. He was executive editor of Esquire in the 1970s. He wrote novels, nonfiction books and a popular children’s book. But he was probably best known as the amiable but intellectually rigorous host of “Adam Smith’s Money World,” seen on PBS from 1984 to 1997. Mr. Goodman did not choose the pseudonym Adam Smith, after the 18th-century philosopher who shaped the discipline of economics with his concept of an “invisible hand” that governed markets. Rather, it was given to him as a young journalist for New York magazine in the 1960s, to hide his identity from sensitive Wall Street sources. He hated the name at first and tried to change it, but he could not find out who had bestowed it, although many sources said it was Clay Felker, New York magazine’s founding editor. “Of course, after my books became successful, three people owned up,” Mr. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times in 1981. Advertisement His first book as Adam Smith, “The Money Game,” published in the spring of 1968, became an immediate best seller and remained one for the rest of the year. In it, he posited that the machinations of money were high drama, understandable to the lay reader and, perhaps most important to the book’s success, humorous. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post both lauded it as a masterly exposition of mass psychology. Mr. Goodman followed up with more books about economics, including “Supermoney” (1972) and “Paper Money” (1981). In “Paper Money,” he made a joke about economists’ jargon that became famous in and out of the field: Stuck without tools on a desert island, an economist theorizes, “Assume a can opener.” In 1985, as “Adam Smith’s Money World” was beginning its run, Mr. Goodman told United Press International that the show was about money, not economics. “Everybody’s interested in money,” he said. “Money, food and sex, not necessarily in that order.” He continued, “As my Texas friends say, ‘Money ain’t everything, but everything won’t go out with you unless you’ve got it.’ ” George Jerome Waldo Goodman was born in Clayton, Mo., on Aug. 10, 1930. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, then studied political economy at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. He served in the Army as an intelligence analyst in the mid-1950s, then wrote about various topics for Barron’s, Time, Fortune and other magazines. His passion in the 1950s was writing novels. His first was “The Bubble Makers” (1955), a story of conflict between a Harvard student and his wealthy grandfather. He had written it instead of a thesis at Oxford. Three subsequent novels were well received, with critics particularly complimentary about their dialogue. Mr. Goodman’s fourth novel, “The Wheeler Dealers” (1959), about the pyrotechnics between a Texas oil baron and a female broker, was made into a movie in 1963 starring James Garner and Lee Remick. Mr. Goodman wrote the screenplay. But he soon began focusing on economic matters, an interest he had demonstrated with his satirical treatment of upper-class characters in his novels. “I was curious to know why some people make money and others don’t,” he told Lear’s magazine in 1989. Advertisement He began managing what he told U.P.I. was “a small, aggressive mutual fund,” started a regular financial feature in New York magazine and helped found The Institutional Investor. As his economics books succeeded, he turned to television, where he employed graphics, interviews and even cartoons to clarify financial issues. “Adam Smith’s Money World” was broadcast in 40 countries. But the best part of “Adam Smith’s Money World,” John Corry wrote in The Times in 1984, was Mr. Goodman’s commentary. Mr. Goodman, he suggested, should spend more time “interviewing himself.” Mr. Goodman’s wife, the former Sallie Brophy, died in 2007. In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughter, Susannah Goodman; his partner, Lynda Richards; and three grandchildren. Mr. Goodman said his most widely read work may have been “Bascombe, the Fastest Hound Alive,” a children’s book he published in 1958. But it was his ability to evoke an emotional response to economic phenomenon that most defined his impact. “We are at a wonderful ball where the champagne sparkles in every glass and soft laughter falls upon the summer air,” he wrote of a high-flying stock market in “The Money Game.” “We know at some moment the black horsemen will come shattering through the terrace doors wreaking vengeance and scattering the survivors,” he continued. “Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking — what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.” A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2014, on page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: George Goodman, Who Demystified the World of Money, Dies at 83.

Foreign   Deadly Violence Erupts During Rallies Across Egypt. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREEM FAHIMJAN. 3, 2014 CAIRO — At least 13 people were killed as violence broke out during Muslim Brotherhood marches in several Egyptian cities on Friday, health officials said, in the deadliest day of clashes in months. The victims included protesters — one an 18-year-old college sophomore — and, apparently, bystanders. Brotherhood supporters said riot police officers had fired on their marches without provocation in some places, while the authorities said they had seized weapons from demonstrators. Dozens of people sustained gunshot and other injuries in violence that was the latest blow to the military-backed government, which is trying to impose stability just 10 days before Egyptians are set to vote on a draft constitution. Six months after the army’s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, the grinding civil conflict between Mr. Morsi’s supporters and the government appears to be reaching another peak. The authorities are desperate to hold the constitutional referendum, seeing it as a chance to quiet unrest by marginalizing the Brotherhood with a public show of support for the government-sponsored charter. A strong showing, the official thinking goes, would bolster the government’s legitimacy, and restore momentum to a transitional plan that is supposed to lead to parliamentary and presidential elections. Before the vote, the authorities have stepped up a crackdown on opponents, arresting hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and non-Islamist activists. Advertisement The Brotherhood has responded to the government’s efforts to eradicate the movement — including, last month, officially designating it a terrorist group — by trying to project endurance and vowing to continue the protests. Brotherhood supporters have intensified their demonstrations on campuses, including Al-Azhar University in Cairo. On the past two Fridays, the traditional day of protest, Brotherhood leaders have mustered sizable crowds around the country. Fighting was reported on Friday in several cities, including Cairo, Alexandria and Ismailia. In Fayoum, a senior Brotherhood leader said, the authorities fired live ammunition at marches that had set off from three mosques after prayers, killing the student, Mahmoud Abdel-Aziz, and two men ages 31 and 52. In Cairo, one man was shot dead after yelling insults at Brotherhood protesters, a security official told the Reuters news agency. In Alexandria, an Associated Press cameraman reported seeing dozens of protesters armed with homemade pistols clashing with security forces. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that 17 of its officers had been injured with birdshot, and that 235 Brotherhood members had been arrested. Asmaa al Zohairy contributed reporting.

Business   50 Years Later, War on Poverty Is a Mixed Bag. Advertisement Advertisement By ANNIE LOWREYJAN. 4, 2014 WASHINGTON — To many Americans, the war on poverty declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson has largely failed. The poverty rate has fallen only to 15 percent from 19 percent in two generations, and 46 million Americans live in households where the government considers their income scarcely adequate. But looked at a different way, the federal government has succeeded in preventing the poverty rate from climbing far higher. There is broad consensus that the social welfare programs created since the New Deal have hugely improved living conditions for low-income Americans. At the same time, in recent decades, most of the gains from the private economy have gone to those at the top of the income ladder. Half a century after Mr. Johnson’s now-famed State of the Union address, the debate over the government’s role in creating opportunity and ending deprivation has flared anew, with inequality as acute as it was in the Roaring Twenties and the ranks of the poor and near-poor at record highs. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps are keeping millions of families afloat. Republicans have sought to cut both programs, an illustration of the intense disagreement between the two political parties over the best solutions for bringing down the poverty rate as quickly as possible, or eliminating it. For poverty to decrease, “the low-wage labor market needs to improve,” James P. Ziliak of the University of Kentucky said. “We need strong economic growth with gains widely distributed. If the private labor market won’t step up to the plate, we’re going to have to strengthen programs to help these people get by and survive.” Advertisement In Washington, President Obama has called inequality the “defining challenge of our time.” To that end, he intends to urge states to expand their Medicaid programs to poor, childless adults, and is pushing for an increase in the minimum wage and funding for early-childhood programs. But conservatives, like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have looked at the poverty statistics more skeptically, contending that the government has misspent its safety-net money and needs to focus less on support and more on economic and job opportunities. “The nation should face up to two facts: poverty rates are too high, especially among children, and spending money on government means-tested programs is at best a partial solution,” Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution wrote in an assessment of the shortfalls on the war on poverty. Washington already spends enough on antipoverty programs to lift all Americans out of poverty, he said. “To mount an effective war against poverty,” he added, “we need changes in the personal decisions of more young Americans.” Advertisement Still, a broad range of researchers interviewed by The New York Times stressed the improvement in the lives of low-income Americans since Mr. Johnson started his crusade. Infant mortality has dropped, college completion rates have soared, millions of women have entered the work force, malnutrition has all but disappeared. After all, when Mr. Johnson announced his campaign, parts of Appalachia lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. Many economists argue that the official poverty rate grossly understates the impact of government programs. The headline poverty rate counts only cash income, not the value of in-kind benefits like food stamps. A fuller accounting suggests the poverty rate has dropped to 16 percent today, from 26 percent in the late 1960s, economists say. But high rates of poverty — measured by both the official government yardstick and the alternatives that many economists prefer — have remained a remarkably persistent feature of American society. About four in 10 black children live in poverty; for Hispanic children, that figure is about three in 10. According to one recent study, as of mid-2011, in any given month, 1.7 million households were living on cash income of less than $2 a person a day, with the prevalence of the kind of deep poverty commonly associated with developing nations increasing since the mid-1990s. Both economic and sociological trends help explain why so many children and adults remain poor, even putting the effects of the recession aside. More parents are raising a child alone, with more infants born out of wedlock. High incarceration rates, especially among black men, keep many families apart. About 30 percent of single mothers live in poverty. In some cases, government programs have helped fewer families because of program changes and budget cuts, researchers said. For instance, the 1996 Clinton-era welfare overhaul drastically cut the cash assistance available to needy families, often ones headed by single mothers. Advertisement “As of 1996, we expected single mothers to go to work,” Professor Ziliak said. “But if they’re shelling out most of their weekly pay in the form of child care, they can’t make sense of doing it.” The more important driver of the still-high poverty rate, researchers said, is the poor state of the labor market for low-wage workers and spiraling inequality. Over the last 30 years, growth has generally failed to translate into income gains for workers — even as the American labor force has become better educated and more skilled. About 40 percent of low-wage workers have attended or completed college, and 80 percent have completed high school. Economists remain sharply divided on the reasons, with technological change, globalization, the decline of labor unions and the falling value of the minimum wage often cited as major factors. But with real incomes for a vast number of middle-class and low-wage workers in decline, safety-net programs have become more instrumental in keeping families’ heads above water. The earned-income tax credit, for instance, has increased employment among single mothers and kept six million Americans above the poverty line in 2011. Food stamps, formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, kept four million Americans out of poverty in 2011. Above all, the government has proved most successful in aiding the elderly through the New Deal-era Social Security program and the creation of Medicare in the 1960s. The poverty rate among older Americans fell to just 9 percent in 2012 from 35 percent in 1959. But for working-age households, both conservatives and liberals agree that government transfer programs alone cannot eliminate poverty. The answer, the White House has said, is in trying to improve households’ earnings before tax and transfer programs take effect. “Going forward, the biggest potential gains that could be made on poverty would be in raising market incomes,” said Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “In the short run, that means things like the minimum wage, and in the long run, things like early education.” If Congress approved a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from its current level of $7.25, it would reduce the poverty rate of working-age Americans by 1.7 percentage points, lifting about five million people out of poverty, according to research by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. But in the meantime, the greatest hope for poorer Americans would be a stronger economic recovery that brought the unemployment rate down from its current level of 7 percent and drew more people into the work force. The poverty rate for full-time workers is just 3 percent. For those not working, it is 33 percent.

Foreign   Strategic Corridor in West Bank Remains a Stumbling Block in Mideast Talks. Advertisement Advertisement By ISABEL KERSHNERJAN. 4, 2014 BARDALA, West Bank — The residents of this neglected Palestinian farming village in the northern Jordan Valley area of the West Bank say they get running water once every three days, which they store in bottles and cisterns. The neighboring Jewish settlement of Mehola is a small paradise by comparison, with green lawns and a swimming pool. The contrasts across this stark landscape of jagged hills reflect the complexities of the fierce contest for control of the Jordan Valley, and the challenges the Palestinians face in administration. As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators struggle to make headway on peace talks initiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, they have remained bitterly at odds over the strategic corridor that runs between the populous heartland of the West Bank and the border with Jordan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel insists on maintaining a long-term Israeli military presence along the border to prevent infiltrations and weapons smuggling from the east. Some in his Likud Party say there is no security or strategic depth without the settlements and argue that Israel should annex the area permanently. The Palestinians insist that Israel withdraw its forces and settlements so they can control their own borders as part of an independent and sovereign state. But for the residents of the Jordan Valley, where the long summers are intense and the black flies ubiquitous, the diplomatic jockeying is secondary to the hard realities facing two intertwined, adversarial communities. While settlers worry they will lose their homes, the Palestinians, who view the fertile valley as the breadbasket of a future state, are concerned that Israel will continue to control nearly all the water and land. Advertisement “We live at their mercy,” said Dirar Sawafta, an employee of the Bardala village council. Some 60,000 Palestinians live here in scattered villages and the ancient oasis city of Jericho. They farm about 8,600 acres of the land, much of it leased from wealthy Palestinian landowners in Jerusalem and Nablus. Many complain of mismanagement and dysfunction on the part of the Palestinian Authority, which administers Jericho and the villages, as well as the strictures of Israeli military rule. The 6,500 Israeli settlers live in 21 small communities interspersed with army bases. Farming nearly 13,000 acres, they use treated wastewater to irrigate their abundant date groves and employ 6,000 Palestinians in a thriving agricultural enterprise adapted to the semitropical climate. Advertisement Palestinian leaders contend that Israel wants to remain here indefinitely out of economic interests. Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator, who lives in Jericho and represents the Jordan Valley in the Palestinian legislature, listed the settlers’ assets: “The biggest palm farms, the biggest grape farms, turkey farms and alligator lakes.” Yet the Jordan Valley settlers — many of whom came in search of a pastoral life under the aegis of security-minded Labor-led governments after the 1967 war — live with growing uncertainty that the government will support their continued presence there. In 1997, during his first term as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu wrote a letter to the settlers saying that “the Jordan Valley will be an integral part of the state of Israel under any agreement.” But many settlers here note that Mr. Netanyahu now speaks only of maintaining a military presence. In Bardala, the issues are complex, as occupation and internal Palestinian problems have left the wells dry. Before Israel conquered the area from Jordan in 1967, Bardala’s water came from a nearby spring. But the Israelis dug a deeper well nearby. “Ours dried up,” Mr. Sawafta said. A deal was made in the 1970s, and the Oslo peace accords of the 1990s brought new water agreements, but with the second uprising in 2000, Palestinians stopped paying their water and electricity bills to the Palestinian Authority. The Bardala council owes the authority about two million shekels (more than $560,000) in unpaid utility bills. So, Mr. Sawafta said, the authority has delayed funding for projects like new roads, a dam and a water network in the village. Israel deducts the utility debts from the tax revenue it collects on behalf of the authority. Then the ever-cash-poor Palestinian government uses the rest to pay its employees’ salaries. Advertisement After that, there is little left to aid the farmers. Rifaat Hamdallah Daraghmeh, a Palestinian who employs 15 families on a farm he runs in the Jiftlik area of the valley and sells produce in Israel, said the authority owed him 300,000 shekels (about $85,000) in unpaid tax refunds over the past four years. Abdul Ghaffar Dawabshe, the deputy director of the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture department in Jericho, said there were 60 such cases in his office. Khirbet Makhoul, a Bedouin-style encampment in the northern Jordan Valley, has in recent months become a symbol of the continuing struggle over every inch of Jordan Valley land. In September, Israeli army bulldozers arrived at dawn and razed all the temporary structures, including those that housed animals and people. Supporters brought new tents, but the army came back three more times. The women and children moved to permanent homes in Tamoun, a village near Nablus. “We used to live like kings,” said Ashraf Bisharat, 30, a member of one of the dozen or so families raising livestock here, who noted that before September, the bare hillside was filled with animal shelters. Makhoul sits between three army bases, and soldiers in training provide a steady background noise of booms and gunfire. Israeli defense officials said the shelters had been destroyed because they were erected without permits. The families have refused to leave the land they say they have owned or leased for decades. Now the authority is helping them register their plots and obtain permits. One animal shelter was rebuilt. Some of the local men were sleeping under nylon sheets, each on the ruins of his family tent. Most of the Jordan Valley is classified as Area C, the part of the West Bank that remains under full Israeli control. Permits, whether for agricultural packing houses or zinc-roofed shacks, are hard to come by, and demolitions take place almost daily. For now, the Jewish settlers are guarding their positions, too. After two Palestinians from the Hebron area bludgeoned a retired Israeli colonel to death in October in the yard of his home in Brosh Habika, an isolated tourism village here, yeshiva students and families from a nearby religious settlement temporarily moved into the holiday chalets to reinforce and demonstrate a presence. In recent years, the settlers have planted part of a demilitarized zone between the border security fence and the actual border along the Jordan River with thousands of date palms. Children of the founders of the settlements who left for the city are now returning, attracted by cheap housing and rural community living. This week, a senior Likud minister dedicated a new neighborhood in Gitit, a remote, once-secular settlement that has been revived by an influx of religious settlers. Advertisement “It took us 30 years to understand what to grow and how to grow it,” David Alhayani, the Likud head of the settlers’ Jordan Valley Regional Council, said in a recent interview. Mr. Alhayani runs an herb farm in his hilltop settlement, Argaman, where he employs more than 20 Palestinians. He spoke of quiet friendship and cooperation with his workers and some local Palestinian notables. “They called us pioneers, salt of the earth, the true Zionists,” he said of the Israeli mainstream. Now, he said, the Labor Party and many others seem to have abandoned the Jordan Valley settlers. “We came because our government sent us here — all the governments of Israel,” he added. “If the Israeli government decides differently, we will accept the decision.” Said Ghazali contributed reporting.

Society   A Romance Goes From Head to Heart. Advertisement Advertisement By MARGAUX LASKEYJAN. 5, 2014 Barbara Catherine Galletly and Grant Olney Passmore were married Saturday by the Rev. Davis Bailey, a Presbyterian minister, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. In August, the bride, 30, received a master’s in information studies from the University of Texas. Until 2011, she was a literary agent at Georges Borchardt in New York. She graduated from Brown. She is a daughter of Catherine G. Galletly and Donald R. Galletly of Wayne, Pa. The bride’s father is a senior vice president at Devine & Partners, a public relations firm in Philadelphia. Her mother, now retired, worked in Houston as a senior vice president for financial institutions at Bank of America. The groom, also 30, is a mathematical researcher at the University of Edinburgh, and a singer and songwriter. He graduated from University of Texas and received a certificate in mathematical logic from the Mathematical Research Institute in the Netherlands. He holds a Ph.D. in automated theorem-proving and high-dimensional geometry from the University of Edinburgh. He is the son of Donna O. Passmore and Dr. John M. Passmore of Sugar Land, Tex. The groom’s mother is a founder of Values Through History, an educational nonprofit there that creates American history curriculums for schools. His father is a cardiologist at Methodist Diagnostic Cardiology of Houston. Advertisement Mr. Passmore had heard about Ms. Galletly long before they came in direct contact, primarily through Ms. Galletly’s sister, Patrice, a co-worker of his own sister. In January 2012, he happened to click on a link found on Patrice Galletly’s Facebook page that led to an essay written by Barbara Galletly, who within a short period had moved from New York to Los Angeles to Austin. It was titled “Doing This Again.” Mr. Passmore could relate. “It was a beautiful piece,” he said. “I was a Ph.D. student, and I moved around like crazy. She was having a similar nomadic 20s.” When he sent her an email, Ms. Galletly was delightfully stunned. She, in turn, responded, “Oh, my goodness, I’ll never have a fan again.” And so began a seven-month trans-Atlantic correspondence about their passions and pursuits. They discussed early Internet culture and digital preservation. He tutored her in calculus and statistics (skills she needed for graduate school), and she taught him about literary theory. They shared a Dropbox folder through which they shared music, pictures and articles. “I remember having to work up the courage to call it Our Folder,” Mr. Passmore said. “It was a real intellectual romance.” At one point, she copied and pasted their correspondence into a Word document. It was 300 pages long. Yet they still hadn’t talked on the phone. They finally met in the summer of 2012, when she was working as an intern in the library and archive at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and Mr. Passmore was on a project at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. While there was an almost immediate connection and a sense of comfort with each other, when she picked him up at the airport, they were both nervous, Ms. Galletly particularly so. “I didn’t want it to be ruined,” she said. She came around, and two days later they shared their first kiss. Advertisement “It was like, ‘Oh my gosh, what could be better?’ ” she said. “I feel like I won the lottery.” MARGAUX LASKEY A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2014, on page ST11 of the New York edition with the headline: A Romance Goes From Head to Heart.

Sports   After Long Wait, Good Things Come to Visiting Saints. Advertisement Advertisement By BILL PENNINGTONJAN. 5, 2014 PHILADELPHIA — The New Orleans Saints joined the N.F.L. in 1967 and did not make the playoffs for 20 years. It took the Saints another 13 years to win a playoff game. And Saturday night, 46 seasons after their debut in the N.F.L., they finally won a road playoff game. The Saints’ 26-24 win Saturday in an N.F.C. wild-card game in Philadelphia, sealed with a 32-yard field goal by Shayne Graham on the game’s final play, was more than a franchise playoff milestone. To the players, it helped them begin to move away from a 2012 season marred by a bounty scandal. “It’s a new team and a new year,” said New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, who has been with the Saints through the bad and the good, including the team’s Super Bowl victory after the 2009 season. “We’re not living off the glory or the mistakes of the past. We’re making a new history and hopefully we’re only going to get better.” Saints Coach Sean Payton, who was suspended last year by the N.F.L., was also eager to look forward. “This team has the resolve to overcome many distractions,” Payton said. “With all the other stuff that’s gone on, including last year, we’ve now got 12 wins. And we won on the road. I thought we traveled pretty well tonight.” An uneven game that began sleepily suddenly turned electrifying and tense in the fourth quarter as Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles and Brees dueled throughout a seesaw final quarter. The outcome left the Saints (12-5) on their way to face the Seattle Seahawks next weekend. The Eagles’ season ended but not after a surprisingly successful year that saw them win 10 games and go to first place in the N.F.C. East from last. Advertisement “We’re all proud of how far we went,” Philadelphia wide receiver Riley Cooper said. “But everybody wants to win more — win everything. All I can say is that we’re headed in the right direction.” With the Saints leading by 23-17 midway through the fourth quarter, Foles led the Eagles on a 77-yard scoring drive. The key sequence was a pass interference penalty on Saints cornerback Corey White that netted Philadelphia 40 yards and gave them a first down at the New Orleans 3-yard line. Two plays later, Foles threw to Zach Ertz for the go-ahead touchdown and a 24-23 Eagles lead with less than five minutes to play. But the Saints’ Darren Sproles returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards and there was a 15-yard penalty for a horse-collar tackle tacked onto the end of the return. Two plays later, the Saints had advanced to the Eagles 35-yard line. The Saints methodically worked the football closer to the end zone, trying to use up as much clock as possible. With three seconds remaining in the game, the Saints took their final time out setting up the winning kick, Graham’s fourth field goal of the game. Graham was another new face of the New Orleans turnaround. Three weeks ago, he was not on the roster. That was when Graham was brought in to replace the slumping place kicker Garrett Hartley. “He’s been unbelievable,” Payton said. “Each one of those kicks tonight was down the middle. He was a rock out there.” With the final score of the game, the teams had combined for 16 points in the fourth quarter and 37 in the second half. Trailing by 7-6 at the start of the second half, the Saints seemed intent on establishing the run game and it was a successful strategy. As much as Brees played well in the second half, and completed 20 of 30 passes for 250 yards over all, the Saints running backs rushed for 185 yards and averaged more than 5 yards per carry. Advertisement Mark Ingram, playing for the injured starting running back Pierre Thomas, ran for 97 yards on 18 attempts and had pivotal runs in the Saints’ first scoring drive of the second half. That series culminated with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Brees to Lance Moore. It was a typically intricate Saints play. With multiple receivers working the sidelines, Brees waited in the pocket as Moore, releasing late and working underneath the other receivers, sprung free in the middle of the field for the touchdown. That score put New Orleans ahead and Brees helped extend the lead with some effective deep downfield passing that led to a 4-yard touchdown run by Ingram that gave New Orleans a 20-7 advantage in the third quarter. But the Eagles decided that they could run the football, too, and behind LeSean McCoy mounted an eight-play touchdown drive that cut the New Orleans lead to 20-14. When Saints starting cornerback Keenan Lewis was sidelined with a head injury, his absence seemed to unleash the Eagles talented wide receiver DeSean Jackson. He caught two passes and also had a 29-yard punt return that set up a 31-yard field goal by Alex Henery that cut the Saints’ lead to 20-17 early in the fourth quarter. But Brees managed to rally the Saints again, connecting with wide receiver Robert Meacham for 40 yards down the middle of the field — a reception that led to a 35-yard field goal by Graham and a 23-17 New Orleans lead. Though much was made of the Saints having to play in the winter elements of the Northeastern corridor as opposed to the domed stadium in New Orleans where they were undefeated this season, the game was played in relatively benign conditions. The game time temperature was 25 degrees with only a 5-mile-an-hour wind. So bad weather was not an excuse for the sloppy play by both teams in the early going. Brees threw two first-half interceptions and Foles, the league’s top-rated passer, had just 98 passing yards in the first two quarters. Foles would finish the game with only 195 passing yards as he completed 23 of 33 passes. While the Eagles held a 1-point lead at halftime, it was the Saints who were buoyed in the locker room at intermission. “We knew we would be all right if we stopped shooting ourselves in the foot,” Payton said. In the Saints locker room afterward, most of the conversation was about finally getting a road playoff victory after five losses away from home in the postseason. New Orleans tackle Zach Strief was asked if he thought questions about the Saints’ road playoff woes would now cease. “Probably not,” Strief said. “Now we go to Seattle, where it’s tough to play. It will come up all week again.” A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2014, on page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: After Long Wait, Good Things Come to Visiting Saints.

Travel   Traveling While Black. Advertisement Advertisement By FARAI CHIDEYAJAN. 3, 2014 As I walked through the Forbidden City, the majestic imperial palace at the center of Beijing, with a friend and her teenager, I scanned the crowd. In the maze of shrines and courtyards, there was no one quite like us: I am an African-American with long dreadlocks, and my friend, Maria, a Mexican-American, had her half-Dominican son in tow. And yet, we were nearly invisible — at least to the guards checking the bags of Chinese tourists, possibly for materials that could be used in protests at this landmark, which adjoins Tiananmen Square. We passed through checkpoint after checkpoint unhindered, while Chinese people were stopped and their bags searched. Sure, we got a couple of stares from people. But no one touched our hair, pointed or acted hostile — which has happened to me as a tourist even in the United States. Once again, my travels had taken me to a place — not just a physical but a mental place — where the rules as I knew them had changed. That is partly what drives my wanderlust. And I am part of a sizable fellowship of African-Americans on a mission to see the world. Seventeen percent of African-Americans take one or more international trips a year, and we spend $48 billion on travel in the United States alone, according to the Mandala Research firm. That amount may be smaller than spending by other (not mutually exclusive) niche groups like LGBT travelers ($70 billion). But, according to analysts at MMGY Global, a marketing firm, black travel has rebounded since 2008, which is notable considering that the great recession doubled the gap between black and white wealth. When you look at per capita income, our travel spending is significant. Yet for all of that buying power, major hospitality companies and tour operators often steer clear of targeting African-Americans. After all, it’s complicated. Hoteliers are promoting women-only floors, but that idea would be anathema to black travelers, who are concerned about getting equal and respectful treatment from staff members. Similarly, tour operators pushing gay-friendly getaways would not be wise to advertise trips as “black-friendly.” We are a niche that it seems shouldn’t exist in a country that aspires to be postracial. As a result, minority travelers are mainly paving our own path, guided by ourselves, our social and professional networks and by bloggers. We are a largely untapped market, exploring the world without being aggressively sold an itinerary on how to do it. That means there are few guidebooks or tour operators to prepare me for the moment of surprise that I experienced in the Forbidden City. And it is one of the reasons that travel right now feels more freeing than ever. Advertisement For African-Americans, domestic and international exploration used to be filled with significant roadblocks. From the late 19th century until the civil rights era, the lack of parity in pay left African-Americans with little to spend on leisure (a disparity that continues to this day); segregation meant substandard seats and service on public transportation; and finding lodging on the road if you were black, in particular, was a challenge, especially in the South. “The Negro Traveler’s Green Book” was published from 1936 until 1964 to give black travelers a list of places where it was safe to stay and to stop. Published by a postal worker named Victor H. Green, the book was used by thousands of African-Americans as they crisscrossed the United States by car. Green optimistically wrote in one edition: “There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States.” As part of the generation that came after Green’s last edition, I was raised to believe that the world was mine by my Zimbabwean father and my African-American mother, a Baltimore native who headed off to Morocco to serve in the Peace Corps. When I was 5, I traveled with my mother and younger sister to visit my father’s family in what was then apartheid-like Rhodesia. I remember meeting my grandparents and scores of cousins, many of whom did not speak English, and sitting with the family at sunset, eating chewy maize roasted over the fire. It was the first time I felt a specific comforting heart-song, repeated over the years in places like the outdoor terrace cafe of the Louvre in Paris to the top of Mount Tamalpais in Northern California. That feeling can take on particular meaning because it disrupts double-consciousness — the term coined by W. E. B. DuBois to explain the necessity of African-Americans to constantly regard themselves through others’ eyes. As a black traveler, I seek liberation through exploration and find myself seeming freer, at least in mind and heart, on the road than at home. Many others feel that way, too. Elaine Lee is one such kindred spirit. She runs the site Ugogurl.com, which features a picture of Ms. Lee hefting an ice ax at the top of a New Zealand glacier. A lawyer by trade, she’s also the editor of the anthology “Go Girl: The Black Woman’s Book of Travel and Adventure.” “Travel is the music of my soul,” Ms. Lee said. “The biggest surprise about traveling internationally was to discover that in many parts of the world, it is an asset to be a black woman, unlike in North America, where it is often a liability. Travel to Africa is among the most healing of all. You go there and get part of your soul back.” The idea that travel is a soul-stirring experience was echoed by Greg Gross, who got a taste for traveling when, as a child, he went from New Orleans to Los Angeles on the Sunset Limited. A former newspaper journalist, Mr. Gross started the blog ImBlackNITravel.com (I’m Black and I Travel) six years ago after coming across a black woman in Natchez, Miss., who proudly said she never intended to set foot outside the limits of her native city. Though he’s traveled the world, he says his most emotionally resonant moment happened in the United States, in the nation’s capital: “I walked over to the Lincoln Memorial. I wanted to stand on the exact step where Martin Luther King Jr. had stood to give his famed ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, to see the view that he saw that day. And I found it. To be in that place, to look out over that same vista, was a moment more powerful than I can explain.  I couldn’t talk. I could barely breathe. I was not the same when I came down off those steps.” There are other, more practical benefits particular to black travelers, like the ability to blend in. Brian Keith Jackson, a novelist who sometimes contributes text and film to the work of the artist Kehinde Wiley, has lived in Beijing, far from his northern Louisiana roots. “In many places, because most of the Western world has been white and has projected their images as white, black skin means Africa, not America,” he said. “Although I’m an American, people don’t view me as an American.” Mr. Jackson, who has short-cropped hair, believes that his pecan skin tone, and the perceptions around it, “helped me in my travels, because everyone thinks I’m from there, certainly in Sri Lanka.” Brown skin that’s often perceived as “otherness” in parts of America is not seen that way in much of the world. After traveling to more than 25 countries (and 48 of the states), I call being brown in a region of brown-skinned people “masking.” I experienced it in southern India, where many people were similar shades of brown as me or darker. I was not mistaken for being a local, but I could circulate less conspicuously than fair-skinned visitors. I took advantage of my skin color (and some common-sense cultural and street smarts, like dressing modestly, showing no valuables and staying alert) to go solo and explore low-income areas of Mumbai that the guards at my luxury hotel had warned me against visiting. My reward: I was invited to lunch at the home of a family, where an older couple and their son and daughter-in-law shared a two-room house. Advertisement That isn’t to say that the experience of traveling while black is one high note after the other. There are bias attacks on blacks in the United States and abroad. Last year, for example, the United States State Department issued an advisory, still in effect, about Greece warning that “there has been a rise in unprovoked harassment and violent attacks against persons who, because of their complexion, are perceived to be foreign migrants. U.S. citizens most at risk are those of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern descent.” And there are high-profile but low-danger incidents, as when Oprah Winfrey was denied a look at a $38,000 purse in Switzerland — “too expensive,” the billionaire said a sales assistant told her. (Of course, not many of us, black or white, are in that league.) That may be why travel patterns are still very much shaped by race. According to Mandala, African-Americans are most likely to visit Florida and Georgia. African-Americans and Latinos are more likely than the general American population to seek our historic attractions; three-quarters of African-American leisure travelers say it’s a critical factor in their choices. Group travel is twice as popular among African-Americans than whites, according to Charlie Presley, the founder of the African-American Travel Conference, perhaps pointing to a sense of security in numbers as well as the proliferation of black interest clubs and professional groups. These clubs help drive black tourism, exposing us to new destinations. Ms. Lee, for example, said that when she made a rare trip to Utah (which is less than 2 percent African-American) with the National Black Ski Association (a.k.a. National Brotherhood of Skiers), “I was pleasantly surprised by the Utahans’ friendly reception of our color-full group. The N.B.S. members typically boost local economies to the tune of $3 million during their weeklong summits.” And bloggers are also pushing black Americans to get out and see our country in all its natural glory. Barry and Cindy Rock, originally from Boston and now living in Georgia, run the site Camping in Color (campingincolor.blogspot.com), which addresses the specific fears about what it’s like to camp — a fear that can encompass both nature and other campers. “I think most folks need to just relax a little bit because everywhere you go in this country you’ll come across somebody who doesn’t like you,” Mr. Rock said. “They may give you a dirty look, but that’s not something that’s going to stop us from enjoying our country.” He continued: “We [black Americans] are as much a part of this country, maybe even more, than a lot of people who are here now so we have the right, and we’re going to take the right, to go anywhere we want to go.” The couple blogs about African-American culture and community throughout the country as well as the pleasures of being outdoors. They’ve since taken scores of friends and family members into the woods, and created a wide circle of explorers via their own trips and their blog. Plenty rely on advice from bloggers like the Rocks, Ms. Lee and Mr. Gross. But often, the circle of explorers on the road grows organically, without any digital intervention, the way it always has. Beandrea July, an artist based in Washington, found that as she traveled in Kauai in 2008, the road opened before her. “I forced my introvert self to go to the farmers’ market around the corner and chat with some people. In so doing I scored an invitation and a ride that night to a barbecue on a fruit farm.” She met another black American on a bus, and the two women traveled throughout the Hawaiian island. “While eating dinner one day, this black guy walked by, and we all looked at each other,” she said. “About an hour later he was taking us out in his kayaks for a tour. This trip was all about abundance, and asking and receiving.” Advertisement For those of us blacks who travel — domestically or internationally, with financial ease or by saving for years — the world can be our playground, our teacher, our beloved. We just have to remember one thing I was lucky enough to learn as a child, and one that I was reminded of in Beijing that fall day. This world can be our place, too.

Business   Daniel Finkel’s Stained Glass Window Problem. Advertisement In this week’s puzzle by Daniel Finkel we continue to follow an itinerant nun who most recently made her way to a shrine in the holy town of Duona. We now join her in some construction work. Having reached the shrine (see Pilgrim’s Puzzle), the pilgrim is put to work making stained glass windows. Following doctrine, she is told to create a frame for the window by connecting the midpoints of a square. Later, the frame is filled in with colored glass. After spending several days building identical frames, she goes to the supervising nun. Pilgrim: Can’t we build the frame in some other way? Supervising Nun: It is written that for these windows, we must connect a point on each side of the square to make a four-sided shape. It is also written that this shape must take up exactly half the square. Verily, as the outside square contains 16 squares, so must the area of the four-sided figure created inside be equal to 8 squares. Pilgrim: But surely there are other ways to do it! I’ve been connecting 2, 5, 8 and 11 over and over. Couldn’t I try 1, 4, 7 and 10, or 1, 6, 9 and 12? I’m sure that there are other ways to take up half the square. Supervising Nun: A novice once tried to convince us that 1, 6, 8 and 11 occupied 8 square units. In reviewing the design we determined it occupied only 7.5. The novice was expelled, and her window frame destroyed. You may investigate the issue on your own time, but violating the doctrine is prohibited. Can the pilgrim find another four-sided shape that touches each side of the square at one of the numbered points and takes up exactly half the area of the original square? If so, how many such four-sided figures are there? That completes this week’s puzzle. Daniel Finkel and his partner Katherine Cook make up the Seattle-based team Math for Love, which believes every student should experience the thrill of mathematical discovery, and very teacher can appreciate the elegance of a great mathematical insight. Math for Love is out to change the culture of mathematics, and they’re starting with love. They’re also out to break things. Here’s Dr. Finkel with a resolution for the new year: Let’s talk about breaking mathematics. We are taught to believe that math is a magical alchemical process. There are these delicate procedures, and you have to sprinkle in exactly the right elements in exactly the right way, spin a black cat around your head, and if you do everything perfectly then you get to find out what 4/5 of 75 is, or what the derivative of (sin x)(cos x) is. The right answer, we’re taught, emerges only if you cast the spell exactly right; if you don’t do them right, well, then dead end. The truth is, this is dead-end thinking. Math isn’t magic and it’s not a religion. And the quickest way to find this out, and take control of your education, is to start breaking the rules. What does this mean in practice? Question, push, doubt conventional wisdom, and encourage your students and children to do the same. That’s what the Pilgrim is doing in this puzzle. She’s given a procedure with one “right” way of doing it, and pushes to see if it can be done another way. And there’s no limit to how far we can go. If our original puzzle uses a square, would it still work for a rectangle? How could you pose the question using a triangle, or a cube? These questions can be tough, but that’s the point: we break math, and then we put it together in more powerful configurations. That’s my New Year’s resolution: break as much mathematics as possible this year. As always — use Gary Hewitt’s Enhancer to increase your breaking ability.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 7. Advertisement   PARIS — Varied are the uses of the telephone, and strange, occasionally, are the misuses to which the apparatus is put. In a case just heard before a Paris Correctional Court, it has even been used as a means for attempting blackmail. It is so easy to call up a number and tell a person that unless certain funds are forthcoming certain disagreeable things will happen. There are no witnesses — unless the person to be blackmailed keeps a bailiff on hand. This is what the plaintiff in the action just heard did. When the threats were repeated the bailiff duly and legally noted them and recognized the voice.  The would-be blackmailer was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. 1964: ‘Life’ Style on the President WASHINGTON — The United States is using the most advanced techniques of the slick magazine media to help introduce President Johnson to the world. In a few weeks the U.S. Information Agency hopes to have a 64-page ‘‘Life’’ magazine-style publication in the hands of people in 105 nations and in 40 languages. The publication, titled ‘‘The President of the United States of America,’’ is the most ambitious production of its kind since the USIA put out a smaller magazine when the Communists erected the Berlin wall.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Business   Oscar, a New Health Insurer, Raises $30 Million. Advertisement Most of the darlings of the last few years have been consumer-focused start-ups, like Instagram and Warby Parker. But a group of investors, including the venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, are doubling down on a bet on health insurance. Oscar, a health insurer co-founded by Mr. Kushner, has raised $30 million in new capital from existing investors, the firm plans to disclose this week. The financing was led by the Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. It also includes Mr. Kushner’s firm, Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst Partners. Open for business since October, the company has grown rapidly. The newest fund-raising round, which comes after an initial round of about $35 million, values the insurer at roughly $340 million. Mr. Kushner will remain chairman, while his co-founders, Kevin Nazemi and Mario Schlosser, will run the firm day to day. It’s an unusual bet that technology can transform one of the stodgiest industries around: health insurance. While Oscar’s fundamental business model doesn’t upend the traditional insurance industry playbook, the three are betting that a service provider can thrive on being friendlier and easier to use. “Our ethos and mission is to create a good consumer experience,” Mr. Kushner said in an interview. “We wanted to create an experience like having a doctor in the family.” For now, Oscar only serves New York City and a few other counties in lower New York State. But Mr. Kushner said that the firm was aiming to eventually expand across the country, a process made easier by already being licensed in one state. Oscar still charges deductibles and monthly payments. But the company focuses on offering other services intended to make life easier for patients, including free generic drugs, free calls to doctors and a handful of free primary care appointments. The start-up also focuses on design and technology, including an online search function that lets patients type in their symptoms in natural language, then being steered to a doctor that suits their needs. To Mr. Kushner, such services are meant to undercut the idea of insurance companies as faceless middlemen. “People just don’t have a relationship with this kind of entity,” he said. “The existing players don’t care about satisfying the customer.” The company’s services are currently available only through New York State’s health insurance exchange, though Mr. Kushner said that the technical troubles of healthcare.gov haven’t hurt business. It’s unclear whether a shinier, friendlier insurer can translate into profit, though Mr. Kushner said Oscar already had thousands of customers and tens of millions of dollars in revenue. While the company has already raised more than $75 million in its short existence, people briefed on the matter said that it wasn’t because of a high cash burn. (About $29 million of the insurance provider’s initial fund-raising was set aside for reserves; meanwhile, employees are trying to save money by taking steps like painting the walls of the company’s headquarters themselves.)

Foreign   As Donations Pour In, Aam Aadmi Party Tries to Transform Campaign Finance. Advertisement MUMBAI — The Aam Aadmi Party, having shaken up the political order in India by its surprisingly strong showing in the Delhi state assembly elections last month, is also making an attempt to change the way the country’s political campaigns are financed. When the party first began campaigning in 2012, it promised complete transparency in its finances, creating a website in which the name of the donor is listed, along with the donor’s country of residence, the date and the amount of the donation. These efforts mark a considerable departure from the murky practices considered the norm in electoral finance in India. “It’s the first time there has been this level of transparency in fund-raising by a political party in India,” said E. Sridharan, academic director at the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India in New Delhi, who has written extensively about electoral finance. The party says that its financial transparency is intended to differentiate Aam Aadmi from the other political parties, which often accept large donations from private enterprises and individual donors. These donors often expect a payback in the form of public sector licenses and favorable regulations. “It was a very conscious decision on the part of the party that we are not going to resort to the usual funding techniques used by political parties, nor are we going to depend on corporates,” said Ankit Lal, social media and IT administrator for the Aam Aadmi Party. While Indian law only requires donations above 20,000 rupees to be made public, the Aam Aadmi Party lists the names of those who give as little as 100 rupees. Also, political parties need to submit their accounts only annually to the Election Commission, but the Aam Aadmi Party has already published their reports of donations on its website. The party has raised 49.5 million rupees, or $794,000, as of Tuesday since its victory in the Delhi state elections in early December. Before the Delhi state elections, the party received an average of 500,000 rupees a day, but currently it is drawing 1.5 million to 2 million rupees a day. For the Delhi elections, over 70,000 individuals donated, of which 55,000 gave 10,000 rupees or less, said Mr. Lal. Nearly 60 percent of the total amount was donated online, where the party has spent much of its fund-raising efforts. Parties can receive an unlimited amount of donations, but for the state elections in December, the party stopped accepting donations on Nov. 17, after it reached its fund-raising goal of 200 million rupees. “We set a campaign cap because we didn’t want to take more money than we needed,” said Mr. Lal. Though the 1-year-old party has found success in fund-raising, the amounts it has received are still small compared what the more established parties have raised in the past. A study by the Association for Democratic Reforms showed that in the 2011-12 financial year, which begins in April, the Congress Party had a total reported income of 3.07 billion rupees and the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., had 1.7 billion rupees. However, the Aam Aadmi Party is willing to reject money if the source doesn’t meet its standards for transparency and honesty. It has turned down donations from certain companies that it deemed as having a less-than-clean track record or from donors whose nationality could not be established. Indians living abroad, also known as nonresident Indians, are allowed to donate to political campaigns in India, but foreign nationals are not. According to the Aam Aadmi Party website, the United States has the highest number of nonresident Indian donors as of Tuesday, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Singapore and Canada. While the average Indian resident donates about 500 rupees, overseas Indians gives an average of 2,000 rupees to the campaign, said Mr. Lal. When India’s Home Ministry ordered an inquiry into allegations of foreign donations to the party in November, the party welcomed the investigation and called on the government to look into each party’s sources of funding. (The inquiry is still pending.) “Political parties have always received money from outside the country,” said Mr. Sridharan. “Some of this money is also being sent out and then being brought back in a round trip through Mauritius. There is money, which is corrupt money, that is taken out of the country to Swiss banks, Mauritius or the Cayman Islands, and being brought back during elections.” In an attempt to encourage traceable contributions, political parties receive tax breaks on the condition that they file audited financial statements. However, several loopholes exist in the current political finance laws. While India bans anonymous donations to political parties, unlimited anonymous donations to individual candidates are allowed. Also, because political parties only have to report donations above 20,000 rupees to the Election Commission, many have claimed that they have received multiple donations of less than 20,000 rupees from the same donor. Campaign donations are widely seen as a channel for illegal money, also known as black money, to be brought into the country. In a study published in September by the nonprofit Association for Democratic Reforms, nearly 75 percent of the funding of Indian political parties comes from unknown sources. “Political funding everywhere in the world is fraught with controversy,” said Jagdeep Chhokar, one of the founders of the Association for Democratic Reforms. “The laws in India are rather dispersed, and therefore it is easy for political parties to avoid giving information about their sources of funding and their expenditure.” In August, the Election Commission proposed making it mandatory for all political parties to issue receipts to each donor, irrespective of the amount donated, and maintain an account of all the receipts that will be audited each year. The commission also suggested that parties deposit all donations in designated bank accounts to keep a check on the use of illegal money. The suggestions have been resisted by most political parties. The Congress Party, which leads the governing coalition in New Delhi, sent a letter to the Election Commission saying that it would prefer to maintain the status quo. Officials from the B.J.P. and the Congress Party did not respond to requests for comment. Samya Chatterjee, a junior fellow specializing in political funding at the Centre for Governance and Politics in Delhi, said it was too early to say whether the Aam Aadmi Party’s actions represent a turning point for campaign finance in India. “But it has already set a higher threshold for transparency in political funding than currently practiced by political parties,” he said. However, other experts in electoral and political funding are skeptical that the Aam Aadmi Party’s practices will lead to a greater transparency in Indian campaign finance. “Political parties cannot afford to start identifying their donors because a lot of this money is kickbacks for government contracts,” said Mr. Sridharan. “The lack of transparency in party funding is directly related to the discretionary and nontransparent nature of government and public enterprise contracting and regulations — which is where corruption happens. Right now, there is a sort of vicious circle that is difficult to break.” One possible solution that has been widely debated is the public funding of campaigns. Currently, the government provides parties accommodation at subsidized rates, income tax exemptions and free air time on state radio and television. “Research shows that one instrument to enhance transparency is direct state funding to parties,” said Sam van der Staak, program manager at the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Stockholm, adding that public funding to parties is now the global norm, with 70 percent of the world’s countries providing it. Additionally, state funding allows the government to insist upon accountability in expenditure and withhold funds in case of noncompliance, he said. “Since political parties will always need money to perform their democratic roles in society, this forces parties to rely on private donations only, many of which come with strings attached,” he said. Mr. Chhokar of the Association for Democratic Reforms said that although public funding has been debated for a long time, it is not likely to be introduced anytime soon. “The bottleneck is that there is no clarity about how much funding is needed because political parties are not willing to share clear expenditure reports,” he said. “Unless it is known how much money is needed, how will they know much public funding to provide.” Regardless of what happens in campaign finance, the Aam Aadmi Party has signaled that it will do things its way. “We wanted to send the message that we are not like normal parties,” Mr. Lal said. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   The Brain, in Exquisite Detail. Advertisement Advertisement The Map Makers By JAMES GORMAN JAN. 6, 2014 Deanna Barch and her colleagues are trying to map connections in the human brain. The study is part of the Human Connectome Project. ST. LOUIS — Deanna Barch talks fast, as if she doesn’t want to waste any time getting to the task at hand, which is substantial. She is one of the researchers here at Washington University working on the first interactive wiring diagram of the living, working human brain. To build this diagram she and her colleagues are doing brain scans and cognitive, psychological, physical and genetic assessments of 1,200 volunteers. They are more than a third of the way through collecting information. Then comes the processing of data, incorporating it into a three-dimensional, interactive map of the healthy human brain showing structure and function, with detail to one and a half cubic millimeters, or less than 0.0001 cubic inches. Dr. Barch is explaining the dimensions of the task, and the reasons for undertaking it, as she stands in a small room, where multiple monitors are set in front of a window that looks onto an adjoining room with an M.R.I. machine, in the psychology building. She asks a research assistant to bring up an image. “It’s all there,” she says, reassuring a reporter who has just emerged from the machine, and whose brain is on display. And so it is, as far as the parts are concerned: cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and all the other regions and subregions, where memories, fear, speech and calculation occur. But this is just a first go-round. It is a static image, in black and white. There are hours of scans and tests yet to do, though the reporter is doing only a demonstration and not completing the full routine. Each of the 1,200 subjects whose brain data will form the final database will spend a good 10 hours over two days being scanned and doing other tests. The scientists and technicians will then spend at least another 10 hours analyzing and storing each person’s data to build something that neuroscience does not yet have: a baseline database for structure and activity in a healthy brain that can be cross-referenced with personality traits, cognitive skills and genetics. And it will be online, in an interactive map available to all. Advertisement Dr. Helen Mayberg, a doctor and researcher at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has used M.R.I. research to guide her development of a treatment for depression with deep brain stimulation, a technique that involves surgery to implant a pacemaker-like device in the brain, is one of the many scientists who could use this sort of database to guide her research. With it, she said, she can ask, “how is this really critical node connected” to other parts of the brain, information that will inform future research and surgery. The database and brain map are a part of the Human Connectome Project, a roughly $40 million five-year effort supported by the National Institutes of Health. It consists of two consortiums: a collaboration among researchers at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, which moved last year to the University of Southern California from U.C.L.A., to improve M.R.I. technology and the $30 million project Dr. Barch is part of, involving Washington University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oxford. Dr. Barch is a psychologist by training and inclination who has concentrated on neuroscience because of the desire to understand severe mental illness. Her role in the project has been in putting together the battery of cognitive and psychological tests that go along with the scans, and overseeing their administration. This is the information that will give depth and significance to the images. JAN. 8, 2014 She said the central question the data might help answer was, “How do differences between you and me, and how our brains are wired up, relate to differences in our behaviors, our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings, our experiences?” And, she added, “Does that help us understand how disorders of connectivity, or disorders of wiring, contribute to or cause neurological problems and psychiatric problems?” The Human Connectome Project is one of a growing number of large, collaborative information-gathering efforts that signal a new level of excitement in neuroscience, as rapid technological advances seem to be bringing the dream of figuring out the human brain into the realm of reality. Worldwide Study In Europe, the Human Brain Project has been promised $1 billion for computer modeling of the human brain. In the United States last year, President Obama announced an initiative to push brain research forward by concentrating first on developing new technologies. This so-called Grand Challenge has been promised $100 million of financing for the first year of what is anticipated to be a decade-long push. The money appears to be real, but it may come from existing budgets, and not from any increase for the federal agencies involved. A vast amount of research is already going on — so much that the neuroscience landscape is almost as difficult to encompass as the brain itself. The National Institutes of Health alone spends $5.5 billion a year on neuroscience, much of it directed toward research on diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Advertisement A variety of private institutes emphasize basic research that may not have any immediate payoff. For instance, at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Janelia Farm in Virginia, part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and at numerous universities, researchers are trying to understand how neurons compute — what the brains of mice, flies and human beings do with their information. The Allen Institute is now spending $60 million a year and Janelia Farm about $30 million a year on brain research. The Kavli Foundation has committed $4 million a year for 10 years, and the Salk Institute in San Diego plans to spend a total of $28 million on new neuroscience research. And there are others in the U.S. and abroad. To be sure, this is not the first time such a focus has been placed on brain research. The 1990s were anointed the decade of the brain by President George H. W. Bush. Strides were made, but many aspects of the brain have remained mysterious. There is, however, a good reason for the current excitement, and that is accelerating technological change that the most sanguine of brain mappers compare to the growing ability to sequence DNA that led to the Human Genome Project. Optogenetics is one new technique that has been transformative. It uses light to turn on different parts of the brain in laboratory animals to open and shut modified genes. Powerful developments in microscopy made possible movies of brain activity in living animals. A modified rabies virus can target one brain cell and mark every other cell that is connected to it. “There is an explosion of new techniques,” said Dr. R. Clay Reid, a senior investigator at the Allen Institute, who recently moved there from Harvard Medical School. “And the end isn’t really in sight,” said Dr. Reid, who is taking advantage of just about every new technology imaginable in his quest to decipher the part of the mouse brain devoted to vision. Advertisement Charting the Brain Of the many metaphors used for exploring and understanding the brain, mapping is probably the most durable, perhaps because maps are so familiar and understandable. “A century ago, brain maps were like 16th-century maps of the Earth’s surface,” said David Van Essen, who is in charge of the Connectome effort at Washington University, where Dr. Barch works. Much was unknown or mislabeled. “Now our characterizations are more like an 18th-century map.” The continents, mountain ranges and rivers are getting more clearly defined. His hope, he said, is that the Human Connectome Project will be a step toward vaulting through the 19th and 20th centuries and reaching something more like Google Maps, which is interactive and has many layers. Researchers may not be looking for the best sushi restaurants or how to get from one side of Los Angeles to the other while avoiding traffic, but they will eventually be looking for traffic flow, particularly popular routes for information, and matching traffic patterns to the tasks the brain is doing. They will also be asking how differences in the construction of the pathways that make up the brain’s roads relate to differences in behavior, intelligence, emotion and genetics. Advertisement The power of computers and mathematical tools devised for analyzing vast amounts of data made such maps possible. The gathering tool of choice at Washington University is an M.R.I. machine customized at the University of Minnesota. An M.R.I. machine creates a magnetic field surrounding the body part to be scanned, and sends radio waves into the body. Unlike X-rays, which are known to pose some dangers, M.R.I. scans are considered to be safe. It is one of the few methods of noninvasive scanning that can survey a whole human brain. There are a variety of ways to gather and interpret information in an M.R.I. machine. And different types of scans can show both basic structure and activity. When a volunteer is trying to solve a memory problem, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex are all going to be involved. An M.R.I. machine can detect the direction of information flow, in a technique called diffusion imaging. In that kind of scan, the movement of water molecules shows not only activity, but which way the traffic is headed. A Path to Research For Dr. Barch, 48, another kind of interest in the human brain put her on the path to Washington University. “I always knew I wanted to be a psychologist,” she said — specifically, a school psychologist. But as an undergraduate at Northwestern, she excelled in an abnormal psychology class, and the professor recruited her to do research. “When I graduated from college, I decided to become a case manager for the chronically mentally ill for a year to kind of suss out, ‘Do I want to do more clinical work or research?’ ” she said. “That was a great experience, but it really made me realize that research is the only way you’re going to have an impact on many lives, rather than sort of individual lives.” She obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. but then did postdoctoral study in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Her years in graduate school in the 1990s coincided with the development and use of the so-called functional M.R.I., which can show not just static structure, but the brain in action. “I got into the field when functional imaging was just at its very beginning, so I was able to learn on the ground floor,” she said. She moved to Washington University after her postdoctoral research partly because of the number of people there working on imaging, including Dr. Marcus E. Raichle, a pioneer in developing ways of watching the brain at work. Advertisement As a professor at Washington University and a leader of one of five teams there working on the Human Connectome Project, Dr. Barch focuses her research on the way individual differences in the brains of healthy people are related to differences in personality or thinking. For instance she said, people doing memory tasks in the M.R.I. machine may differ in competitiveness and commitment to doing well. That ought to show up in activity in the parts of the brain that involve emotion, like the amygdala. However, she points out that the object of the Connectome Project is not to find the answers to these questions, but to provide the database for others to try to do so. ‘Pretty Close’ The project at Washington University requires exhaustive scans of 1,200 healthy people, age 22 to 35, each of whom spends about four hours over two days lying in the noisy, claustrophobia-inducing cylinder of a customized M.R.I. machine. Sometimes they stare at one spot, curl their toes or move their fingers. They might play gambling games, or try memory tests that can flummox even the sharpest minds. “In an ideal world, we would have enough tasks to activate every part of the brain,” she said. “We got pretty close. We’re not perfect, but pretty close.” Over the two days, the research subjects spend another six hours taking other tests designed to measure intelligence, basic physical fitness, tasting ability and their emotional state. The volunteers (and they are all volunteers, paid a flat $400 for their time and effort) can also be seen in street clothes, doing a kind of race around two traffic cones in the sunlit corridor of the glass-walled psychology building, with data collected on how quickly they complete the course. Or they can be glimpsed padding down a hallway in their stocking feet from the M.R.I. machine to an office where a technician dabs their tongues with a swab dipped in a mystery liquid, then asks them to identify the intensity and quality of the taste. In the same office, they type in answers to cognitive tests, and to a psychological survey, for which they are left in solitude because of the personal nature of some of the questions: how they feel about life, how often they are sad. The results are confidential, as are all the test results. Advertisement So far almost 500 subjects have gone through the full range of tests, which amounts to about 5,000 hours of work for Dr. Barch and others in the program. So far, data has been released for 238 subjects, and it is available to everyone for free through a web-based database and software program called Workbench. The sharing of data is characteristic of most of the new brain research efforts, and particularly important to Dr. Barch. “The amount of time and energy we’re spending collecting this data, there’s no possible way any one research group could ever use it to the extent that justifies the cost,” she said. “But letting everybody use it — great!” The Elusive Brain No one expects the brain to yield its secrets quickly or easily. Neuroscientists are fond of deflecting hope even as they point to potential success. Science may come to understand neurons, brain regions, connections, make progress on Parkinson’s. Alzheimer’s or depression, and even decipher the code or codes the brain uses to send and store information. But, as any neuroscientist sooner or later cautions in discussing the prospects for breakthroughs, we are not going to “solve the brain” anytime soon — not going to explain consciousness, the self, the precise mechanisms that produce a poem. Perhaps the greatest challenge is that the brain functions and can be viewed at so many levels, from a detail of a synapse to brain regions trillions of times larger. There are electrical impulses to study, biochemistry, physical structure, networks at every level and between levels. And there are more than 40,000 scientists worldwide trying to figure it out. This is not a case of an elephant examined by 40,000 blindfolded experts, each of whom comes to a different conclusion about what it is they are touching. Everyone knows the object of study is the brain. The difficulty of comprehending the brain may be more aptly compared to a poem by Wallace Stevens, “13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.” Each way of looking, not looking, or just being in the presence of the blackbird reveals something about it, but only something. Each way of looking at the brain reveals ever more astonishing secrets, but the full and complete picture of the human brain is still out of reach. There is no need, no intention and perhaps no chance, of ever “solving” a poet’s blackbird. It is hard to imagine a poet wanting such a thing. But science, by its nature, pursues synthesis, diagrams, maps — a grip on the mechanism of the thing. We may not solve the brain any time soon, but someday achieving such a solution, at least in scientific terms, is the fervent hope of neuroscience. An article on Tuesday about efforts to map the human brain gave outdated information about one of the consortiums that is part of the Human Connectome Project. While the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging used to be based at U.C.L.A., it moved to the University of Southern California last year. Next: Functional connections at a different level. Dr. R. Clay Reid investigates the mouse visual cortex. A version of this article appears in print on January 7, 2014, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Brain, in Exquisite Detail.

Business   Automotive Highlights From C.E.S.. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 8, 2014 ■ Kia’s KND-7 concept, which looks like the CUB concept the company unveiled at the Seoul auto show, made an appearance at the Consumer Electronic Show this week. The KND-7 features suicide rear doors, a 4-seat cabin, something along the bottom of the front doors called turning vanes and a 201-horsepower turbocharged gasoline engine. (Kia) ■ Lucas di Grassi, the Brazilian Formula One driver, put on a show for journalists covering the show on Monday, driving the all-electric Spark-Renault Formula E car, the SRT_01E, in its first dynamic public demonstration. Di Grassi performed a series of (not-so-smoky) doughnuts and skidding stops. (Renault) ■ BMW said it would also introduce new technology in Las Vegas this week, including an automated car that integrates electronically controlled steering with automated brakes for greater control, as well as a camera-based adaptive cruise control that eliminates the need for more costly radar-based systems. As Hyundai integrated its products with Google Glass for the show, BMW says it will blend the Samsung Galaxy Gear with its systems. (BMW) ■ Audi announced Tuesday that it would introduce a TT with a sleek new interior featuring an all-digital instrument cluster that the automaker said eliminated the need for a multimedia interface display in the center of the dash. Audi says the instrument panel will look like an airplane wing and the climate control vents like jet nozzles, giving the cabin an aerospace feel. (Audi) ■ Audi also displayed a commuter-themed exhibit at the show, a look at the needs of big-city commuters called the Audi Urban Future Initiative. Audi showcased technologies such as smartphone-assisted car-to-public transit transitions and cars that park themselves, and questioned what could be done to improve interfaces among car, public transit and pedestrian commuters. (Audi) Advertisement ■ Assuming a practice usually reserved for software companies, Ford announced in Las Vegas on Tuesday that it would hold a developers conference in Dearborn, Mich., this June. The automaker said it would invite companies to create apps for its Sync AppLink system. The company also introduced a partnership with Dominos Pizza that would allow Ford customers to order pizza using voice commands. (Ford) ■ Toyota says that its hydrogen fuel-cell Car of the Future will be reasonably priced, have a 300-mile range and a three- to five-minute fill-up time. Although the car was camouflaged, it was shown with the Toyota FCV concept at the show. Toyota offered few other details, but said the car would be available for sale next year.

Foreign   Colonial Ghosts Continue to Haunt France. Advertisement Advertisement By ADAM NOSSITERJAN. 10, 2014 DAKAR, Senegal — In the paternalist universe of France and a dozen-odd former African colonies, its stifling embrace of the Central African Republic is unique, a century-old hug both protective and deadly. That special relationship is playing out now as France finds itself stuck in a quagmire decades in the making — and one in which France, indirectly at least, has had a hand. The weight of a brutal colonial past and its meddling post-colonial sequel underpin Operation Sangaris, a peacekeeping mission other European countries, and the United States, are so far happy to leave to the French. And perhaps for good reason. For the moment, the 1,600 French troops in the country have kept Muslim and Christian factions uneasily at bay and reduced violence that has killed an estimated 1,000 people and driven more than 900,000 from their homes; as many as 100,000 are camped out at the airport in the capital, Bangui, seeking the protection of French and other troops. The feared genocide — a warning term used by French officials in Paris and at the United Nations last fall — has so far not materialized. But genocide, real or imagined, always had less to do with the reality of a French intervention than with seeking short-term support for it. The underlying reasons have more to do with a long-term bond that has seen French troops deployed in the Central African Republic seven times in just over 30 years, including on three occasions in 1996 — to the point that some French commentators have termed the latest one merely inevitable. This time, for eight months France looked on uneasily as bodies piled up and local hostility toward the Muslim rebel rulers from the north grew. Advertisement Finally, with the large-scale killings of Dec. 5 in Bangui — perhaps precipitated, with some irony, by a scheduled United Nations vote on intervention that day, as local commentators suggested — it could wait no longer. France cannot escape the Central African Republic, and vice versa. More than 15 years ago, a former prime minister, Jean-Paul Ngoupandé, wrote in a despairing memoir that France “needs to question itself, candidly, on its role in the infantilizing of this country.” But long before France’s troops got into the business of making and unmaking rulers, the lands north of the Ubangi River had entered the French conscience. What became the Central African Republic — it was then in French Equatorial Africa — played a central role in forcing the French to recognize the ugly realities of colonial rule across France’s then-vast overseas empire. The devastating travel account of the novelist and essayist André Gide, who traveled through the colony of Oubangui-Chari in 1926-27 and later was awarded a Nobel Prize, caused a scandal when it was first published as “Voyage au Congo,” and it “shocked French opinion in an era when everything was done to hide from the public the negative aspects of the colonial regime,” one of the last French administrators of Oubangui-Chari, Pierre Kalck, wrote years later. Gide had come in search of butterflies and exotic flora and fauna; he stumbled on horrifying accounts of brutality, practiced by French colonial agents, under the thumb of French state-chartered companies exploiting rubber and other resources. Not far from Bangui, inhabitants told the writer of exemplary “punishments” inflicted for not obeying orders or failing to bring in the rubber quotient: men tied to trees and shot, women massacred with machetes, children shut up in a hut and burned alive, men forced to carry huge beams while walking in a circle for hours in broiling heat until they dropped. “Alas, this ‘ballroom scene’ was not, I fear, exceptional in the least,” Gide wrote. “Sleep is impossible for me,” he continued. “An enormous groan now possesses me; Now I know things I feel powerless to do anything about. What demon drove me to Africa?” he wrote. “For now, I know; and I must speak out.” In systematic and until then largely unacknowledged state-sanctioned violence, France had tied itself, for ill and good, to the country’s future. It is a troubled and unequal partnership that is still working itself out. A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Business   Review: Wearable Filip Phone/Tracker. Advertisement Advertisement By ROY FURCHGOTTJAN. 9, 2014 Tracking devices make me uneasy, but I have to defer to parental paranoia, which requires knowing where your children are. A watch/tracker/phone, Filip, may help. I find Filip less odious that most tracking devices. This may be partly because of the bright colors and appealingly goofy oversize design. Available in red, hot pink, bright green and blue, it has a chunky charm. To use the phone, you install the free Filip app on a parent’s Android or iOS device. Then you link to the Filip itself. You can follow the locations of up to five of the Filip devices. You can also set a “safe zone,” which is the distance a Filip can travel before your phone receives an alert. The Times’s Nick Bilton takes a look at smartwatches at the International CES in Las Vegas. You can store multiple zones for each child (your house, a friend’s across town, Grandma’s in another state). The zones are circular, which could be a problem for some; for example, I might allow a child to venture four blocks north, east and west from my house, but four blocks south would put him in the Baltimore Harbor. Parents can use the phone app to send a text message to Filip’s watch face (Call me now!), or place a call to the Filip, which has a speaker phone built in (so be careful what you say). Advertisement The Filip can store five contact numbers. The red call button also acts as an emergency button; when held for three seconds, it starts by calling the person you have as the main contact. If that person doesn’t answer, it will call each contact sequentially until someone picks up. But it can’t be programmed to call 911 as one of the numbers. Dispatches from the International CES in Las Vegas. So far it’s a lot like a phone tracking app, but there is one advantage: You don’t have to worry about your children using Filip to browse the web, because it can’t. Similarly, no texting. There are certainly a few drawbacks to Filip. One is that the batteries run down pretty quickly, so be sure to get it on a charger overnight. Good luck if your child is on a sleepover. I also wonder about the slip-on open bracelet design. Wouldn’t a strap be more secure? Finally, there is the cost. At $200, there are good phones that are less expensive. In addition to the price of the device, there is a $36 activation fee and a $10 monthly fee. Filip may quell some parental worries, even if it’s not the perfect electronic nanny, but I suppose that’s why it’s called Filip, not Mary Poppins. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Senator Signals Support for Sending Helicopters to Iraq. Advertisement Advertisement By PETER BAKER and ERIC SCHMITTJAN. 8, 2014 WASHINGTON — A powerful Senate Democrat signaled Wednesday that he might allow the transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters to Iraq as the government in Baghdad struggles to recapture key territory seized by Islamic extremists in the western part of the country. The senator, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has blocked the lease and sale of the powerful attack helicopters for months while seeking assurances that Iraq would not use them to attack civilians and that the government in Baghdad would take steps to stop Iran from using Iraqi airspace to ship arms to Syria’s military. Mr. Menendez received a three-page letter last week from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq responding to his concerns and received an urgent call from the State Department on Tuesday promising a further response. Although committee officials said the answers so far do not go much further than Mr. Maliki or the administration have in the past, Mr. Menendez was convinced that they are serious about dealing with the concerns given the latest strife in Anbar Province. “The administration is now addressing concerns first raised in July that required responses before this sale could proceed,” said Adam Sharon, the senator’s spokesman. “Provided these issues are sufficiently addressed, Chairman Menendez will be ready to move forward.” The Obama administration has proposed selling 20 to 30 of the helicopters to the Iraqi government, but, because it could take years for them to be built, it has also asked to lease up to 10 aircraft in the interim. Administration officials said the Apaches could be useful in targeting fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda like those who have taken over parts of Fallujah and Ramadi in recent days. But even if Mr. Menendez dropped his objections, it could take until April to deliver them, and officials noted that pilots would still need to be trained. Advertisement Moreover, other senators remain concerned. “I think we have to be very careful,” said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “All of that could fall into the wrong hands.” The administration is separately planning to provide an additional shipment of Hellfire missiles as early as this spring, seeing them as effective at denying Al Qaeda a haven in Anbar. In addition, the administration plans to send Iraq 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones in coming weeks and 48 Raven surveillance drones later in the year. Those come on top of Aerostat surveillance balloons provided to Iraq in September and three additional Bell IA-407 helicopters sent last month. Still, even some senior Democrats who support reinforcing Iraqi troops said Mr. Maliki ultimately bore the burden for crafting a long-term political solution with Sunnis in restive Anbar Province. “You could tactically go in with enough force to displace Al Qaeda, but the long-term success is based on the politics,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. “Maliki has to help himself out.” Go to Home Page »
Home   The Rubber Duckie Has Hit the Road. Advertisement Advertisement By SANDY KEENANJAN. 9, 2014 There’s a bit of a shocker coming out of the inaugural “2014 Winter Bathroom Trends Study” just released by Houzz, the home remodeling and design website. Bathtubs appear to be out of favor. More than 4 in 10 respondents said they were leaving them out of their new master bathrooms; among respondents 55 and older, more than half are going tub-less. “That was the biggest surprise,” said Liza Hausman, Houzz’s vice president for community and marketing. “I would never do that.” Houzz emailed the 37-question survey to all of its registered users. Ninety-three percent of the 7,645 who responded said they were either planning or undergoing a bathroom redo. Among that group, about 25 percent said they were enlarging the original footprint of their bathrooms and 55 percent intended to put in double sinks. For walls, paint trumped tile by 47 to 33 percent, and traditional styling edged out contemporary bathrooms (like the one above) by less than 1 percent. Some preferences correlated with age. “Older homeowners want a hand-held spray; younger ones want a body spray” coming off the wall, Ms. Hausman said. Study results are at houzz.com.

Science   The Workout: Speedskating With Eddy Alvarez Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The workout for Eddy Alvarez, a United States Olympic Team short track speedskater, is designed in part to keep his body balanced even though he relies on his left side when skating.  An inside look at fitness routines, by Anahad O’Connor.  Being a successful short-track speedskater is no easy feat. Members of the United States team follow a grueling schedule that involves up to eight hours of training, six days a week. They lift weights, they run and they cycle. And they practice racing around a rink at 40 miles an hour on two razor-sharp blades. We asked Eddy Alvarez, who will be competing in his first Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February, to take us through a speedskater’s workout. Nicknamed Eddy the Jet, Mr. Alvarez, 23, started roller-skating as a child while growing up in Miami, then transitioned to ice. He has won national and World Cup medals in speedskating. But his career was nearly derailed two years ago by devastating knee injuries, which required surgery that left him bedridden for a month. His doctor told him he might never skate again. But Mr. Alvarez bounced back, and he is now considered a top prospect heading into the Olympics. Recently, we caught up with him at the Olympic Oval training facility in Salt Lake City to talk about how he trains six to eight hours a day to prepare for a 42-second race, how a “dino disc” helps prevent injuries and why he is superstitious about what he eats before a competition. Here is an edited version of our conversation. How long have you been skating? I’ve been skating since I was 5; I used to speedskate on inline skates when I was little down in South Beach. I was kind of a side-street attraction. I was even sponsored by a skate shop in Miami. I would wear their logo and jump over boxes and skate around on the streets of South Beach. How did you get into speedskating on ice? Ice was introduced to me at the age of 7. I still remember the first time I tried it. I can’t tell you exactly where it was, but I remember the feeling. It was quite a rush for me as a 7-year-old, gliding and going fast. What are some of the physical demands of the sport? The positions that we’re in on the ice are, honestly, excruciating. We basically skate in a squat position, but what we try to do is become a compact ball. If you watch us skate, you’ll that see our backs are curved. When people ask me how it feels, the best way I can describe it is to say go and do a wall-sit for 10 minutes and then stand up. That’s how it feels. What is a typical day like? I’m in two places every day. I’m either at the Oval training, or I’m at my house sleeping. I know it’ll be worth it in the end, but I really hope I don’t miss my fun years. What are some of your greatest achievements in skating so far? It’s been a very long road. But the biggest accomplishment that I’ve had would be coming back from my injury. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to face. Can you tell us about your injury comeback? I always had knee issues growing up. We thought it was because I grew very fast, very late. But during the 2009-2010 season, it got to a point where I couldn’t finish workouts. I would come home and cry. But I would tell myself to push through it because it was the Olympic season and I had nothing to lose. So I overdid it. I fell short of the 2010 Games and didn’t make the team, and then I finally went to get my knees checked. I got an ultrasound, and it turned out that I had torn the patella tendons in my knees. I had a total of 12 tears in both knees. The doctor was impressed that I was even able to be in skating condition, because my patella tendons were like strings – dangling strings, basically. Can you tell us about the physical preparation that goes into the sport? We put in a lot of hours. We train six to eight hours a day to go race for 42 seconds. The reason we train this much is so our bodies can recover in between rounds of racing. In competitions, we usually skate six or eight rounds in a day, and it’s usually 15 to 20 minutes of rest and then you’re back at it again. It takes a toll on our bodies. Honestly, I always get sick after a competition. That’s how much I put my body through. Unorthodox is the best word to describe our training and our sport. Does it require some muscles more than others? Our sport is very lower-body dominant. The less weight you carry in your upper body, the easier it is. Unfortunately, I carry a little more than everyone else because I have a baseball background. The muscles in my upper body are a little different than the typical short tracker. It sounds like injuries are a big concern. Injuries are huge for us. We are hitting speeds of roughly 40 miles per hour, and there’s falls and crashes. The training takes a toll on our knees, our backs and our hamstrings. At the stage at which we compete, I don’t think there’s an athlete that’s going to be 100 percent physically, with no injuries. We train our bodies every day, and it’s just something that we have to accept. Are there exercises you do to address these issues? We do extra training on the side to strengthen our weaknesses. I like to do exercises on something that we call a “dino disc.” It’s a little rubber disc that has air in it, and when you step on it, it’s like a balance tool. I work a lot with that to strengthen all the little muscles that we don’t have the opportunity to strengthen and activate while we skate. We also do a lot of rubber-band exercises at the beginning of the season to strengthen the knees and the muscles around them. Then we pray that it holds up throughout the season. What are some of your favorite land exercises? We do a lot of jumping exercises, and we do things to develop our accuracy and our foot speed. We’re trying to simulate what we do on the ice. So you’ll find us doing exercises like “dry skating,” which is basically just straight-away pushes on land to simulate the lactic acid that we build in our legs. And we do something called turn-belt exercises, where they strap a long belt around your waist that looks like a seatbelt, and then you have someone else holding the belt as you’re simulating the lean that we have on the ice. What about cardio? We do a lot of cycling and running. We run or bike for 45 minutes to an hour two to three days a week, and during the summer we do four-hour bike rides twice a week. We ride all the mountains out here in Salt Lake City. What is your approach to diet? I try to cook and eat at home as much as possible so I can control the amount and type of oils I eat. One thing I like to use is coconut oil. I’m also a big fan of juicing vegetables. I absolutely hate eating them. So I stick them in a juicer with some fruit like an apple to sweeten it up and I chug it. Some days, we just have to eat and eat and eat to be able to perform. We don’t want to sell ourselves short by not eating enough. We slice through body fat, and we have to fuel our bodies. You’re not going to find me at McDonald’s or Wendy’s. But I like to eat pasta and bread and carbs. Are there certain foods you like to eat before a race or training? I have a superstition. I don’t like to eat red meat before a competition. When I was little, I was always told that red meat is hard to process and sits in your stomach. So during competitions I only eat chicken. I have this thought that the red meat will just sit in my stomach and make me heavier. So I eat chicken during competitions, and some white rice and pasta. What will it mean to you to compete in Sochi? I dream about standing on that podium, winning a medal. It would be such an accomplishment for me because of everything I had to go through. After my surgery, I went through depression. I wasn’t on the ice for 24 months. It’s been a long road for me, and it would mean a lot for my family. They’ve been there every step of the way. I owe it all to them, and if I succeed, the satisfaction of them being happy is the most important thing in the world to me. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Washington   Two House Democrats Announce Retirement. Advertisement Advertisement By SARAH WHEATONJAN. 8, 2014 WASHINGTON — Two House Democrats, Carolyn McCarthy of New York, and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, on Wednesday announced plans to retire. While Mrs. McCarthy’s seat is likely to stay in Democratic hands, Mr. McIntyre’s district, which includes Wilmington and other parts of eastern North Carolina, is an almost certain pickup for Republicans. After 18 years in Congress, Mr. McIntyre said in a news release, he is ready for a “new chapter” in his life. Republicans saw evidence of Democrats’ vulnerability over the health care law in Mr. McIntyre’s announcement, which comes on the heels of a decision by Representative Jim Matheson, Democrat of Utah, to retire from the House. Yet Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Matheson both voted against the Affordable Care Act. “This retirement announcement also proves that Obamacare and its negative impact continues to burden Democrats in 2014 — even for Democrats who voted against the law like McIntyre and Matheson,” said Representative Greg Walden, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. “When these two throw in the towel, you have to wonder who is next, especially among those Democrats in similar districts who backed Obamacare and other reckless policies.” Yet so far, only three Democrats have announced they will not seek re-election, compared to nine Republicans. Of those, said Representative Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commettiee, six open up “competitive seats in which Republicans will fight a bitter primary to the right and Democrats will nominate strong, problem-solving candidates.” Advertisement Mrs. McCarthy, one of the most ardent advocates in Congress for gun control, announced her decision on the third anniversary of the shooting that left former Representative Gabrielle Giffords with a severe brain injury and killed six in Tucson. Mrs. McCarthy’s husband, Dennis, was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, leading her to become a gun-control activist. Three years later, she ran for public office, switching parties and becoming a Democrat to challenge a Republican who had voted to repeal the federal assault weapons ban. She won, 57 percent to 41 percent. Retirement is “something I’ve been thinking about really for quite a long time,” Mrs. McCarthy said in a telephone interview. She announced in June that she had lung cancer and recently underwent chemotherapy to treat it. She said that new advocates for gun control — including Ms. Giffords and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York — have joined the campaign. “With, unfortunately, my diagnosis of cancer, and I just turned 70 on Sunday, it’s time for their voices to be heard.” Over her nine terms, she has since seen the assault weapons ban expire, and only one of her major efforts to tighten gun restrictions passed: a bill to significantly improve instant background checks. Mrs. McCarthy said she was naïve when she first came to Congress, believing it would be easier to pass gun legislation. “I got the conversation going,” she said.

Business   Dropbox Says Site Down After Maintenance Error, Not From Hackers. Advertisement   But the company said that the site went down because of a problem that arose during regular maintenance, not because it was compromised by hackers. The site was back up before midnight on Friday. “Today’s outage was caused during internal maintenance, and was not caused by external factor,” a company spokeswoman said in an email. “We apologize for any inconvenience.” Still, hackers tried to claim credit, saying the error was the result of a security vulnerability in the website. Hackers who call themselves AnonOpsKorea, a Korean offshoot of Anonymous, said one of their affiliates, using the Twitter handle 1775Sec, was responsible. In a post on Twitter, that individual said the attack was intended to avenge the death of Aaron Swartz, the renowned programmer and charismatic technology activist who committed suicide last year while facing a federal trial on charges of hacking into the M.I.T. computer network. The hacker claimed to have compromised Dropbox’s site using a security vulnerability and threatened to dump Dropbox data if the company did not plug the hole that allowed for the site compromise. “We are giving you time to fix your websites vulnerability. If it’s not fixed expect a Database leak!,” 1775Sec tweeted. Later, the hacker offered a link to what it said was a partial leak of information. But Dropbox said the information was posted a month ago and wasn’t the company’s information. The Dropbox spokeswoman said there was no loss of customer information. “In regards to claims of ‘leaked user information’ – this is a hoax,” she said. “This is not Dropbox data.” Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.

The most surprising development is the change in the ownership of the ‘‘Daily Mirror,’’ which, although a separate company from the ‘‘Daily Mail’’ and Associated Newspapers, was under the direct wing of Lord Northcliffe, who held the bulk of the shares. Many hundred thousands of dollars have been sunk trying to attract English readers to yellow journalism, and the efforts have resulted in badly burned fingers to the promotor. 1939: Mysterious Roar Over Brooklyn BROOKLYN — There was terror in the Brooklyn air last night [Jan. 9]. It caused the greatest mass fright since the too- real broadcast of a ‘‘Martian Invasion’’ but there is no indictment against the radio this time — in fact the mystery is as enveloping as was the terror. A weird noise, called by some ‘‘a big noise’’ that ‘‘flew, like a cloud’’ over Queens, raised hair and goose flesh on burghers in several wards. It was a vibrating sound like that of a distant airplane. It increased in intensity and pitch until it drowned out the rumble of traffic and all but muffled the wail of police sirens. Then the noise faded to a distant purr.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Science   Tonics and Teas Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Last week, in the course of cleaning out my office and downsizing my cookbook library, I came across an interesting book called “Tonics” by Robert A. Barnett. The book is a collection of recipes, not just for liquid tonics, but for all sorts of dishes made with foods and herbs thought to improve well being. It was a rare cold day in Los Angeles and I was inspired by the book to make some tonics of my own: hot infusions made with ingredients I had on hand in my pantry and produce basket. I brewed and tasted, and thought of the founders of Celestial Seasonings tea company, who in the late 1960s and early ‘70s had come up with such household favorites as Red Zinger and Sleepytime Tea doing just what I was doing. I didn’t work with herbs. I was thinking more along the lines of fruit, perfume and spice, and I had many ingredients that had been languishing in my pantry that came to mind. Take the rose petals and the barberries I had bought at my Iranian market and used in a few savory dishes; and the bags of dried fruits that I never seemed to use up. I also wanted to use turmeric, which is believed to offer many health benefits, in some of my teas, and I loved the results when I added a small amount to a lemon infusion and to a coconut and ginger tea. I won’t be starting a tea company with these new drinks, but I will be making them through the winter, and when hot weather arrives I’ll enjoy them iced. Barberry and Orange Tea: A delicious drink made with sour, zingy, vitamin C-rich dried fruit. Rose Petal and Vanilla Tea: A sweet infusion made with just water and three ingredients. Meyer Lemon and Ginger Infusion With Turmeric and Cayenne: You might want to reach for this tea if you feel a sore throat coming on.  Dried Apricot, Cherry and Cranberry Infusion: Simmering dried fruit with some sweet spices results in a great beverage for a snowy day.

Sports   N.F.L. Divisional Playoff Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 10, 2014 Saints at Seahawks 4:35 p.m. Saturday, Fox Line: Seahawks by 8 The term Beast Mode entered the national vernacular three years ago, when Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch executed one of the most memorable runs in N.F.L. history. During a wild-card game against New Orleans, Lynch broke several tackles for a 67-yard touchdown run. His vicious stiff-arm, which seemed like something out of a video game, shoved cornerback Tracy Porter nearly 4 yards out of the way. Although the game was played in Seattle, the Seahawks’ victory was considered a major upset because they had won the N.F.C. West with a 7-9 record. Now Seattle, which went 13-3 this season, is the favorite, especially after thoroughly embarrassing the Saints in a 34-7 win in Week 13. The Seahawks finally proved to be mortal at home, losing to Arizona in Week 16, but they have few weaknesses. On offense Russell Wilson is a contender for most valuable player and Lynch can wear out a defensive line. On defense, Richard Sherman leads the best secondary in the N.F.L. even though Brandon Browner has been suspended indefinitely. Last weekend, New Orleans (11-5 in the regular season) won a playoff game on the road for the first time. But rain and temperatures near 50 were in Saturday’s forecast, weather that is hardly conducive to the Saints’ fast-paced style. To win, they will have to find their own version of Beast Mode. That may be too tall a task. Advertisement Pick: Seahawks Colts at Patriots 8:15 p.m. Saturday, CBS Line: Patriots by 7 To rally from a 28-point deficit, a team has to play poorly enough to be down by 28 points. That is just what Andrew Luck and Indianapolis did in last weekend’s 45-44 win against Kansas City. Put in a hole largely created by Luck’s three interceptions, the Colts turned the game around and stunned the Chiefs. The sloppy play was somewhat typical of Luck’s rookie year, but he matured quite a bit this season. He has guided Indianapolis to consecutive 11-5 records, and should not be as careless with the ball in this game. New England’s defense is strongest at cornerback, with Logan Ryan and Aqib Talib capable of big plays. But injuries have depleted the Patriots’ depth at linebacker, making the middle of the field an easier place for Indianapolis to work. When the Colts are on defense, they will have to hope that Robert Mathis, the N.F.L.’s leader with 19 ½ sacks, can get to Tom Brady early and often to hide their injury-depleted and underwhelming defense. The Patriots, who were 12-4 in the regular season, are big favorites at home and have the veteran leaders to take care of business. But a road playoff win would add to Luck’s growing reputation as a big-game quarterback. Pick: Colts 49ers at Panthers 1:05 p.m. Sunday, Fox Line: 49ers by 1 This matchup of dynamic young quarterbacks will overshadow the fact that two of the N.F.L.’s best defenses will do their best to contain them. San Francisco is known for its dominant front seven, including four of the league’s best defenders in Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman, Justin Smith and Aldon Smith. The 49ers’ secondary is not quite as strong, but cornerback Tramaine Brock had a breakout season and proved a tremendous upgrade from the injured Chris Culliver. And if Carlos Rogers’s hamstring allows him to play, the defense has few weak spots. Carolina does not yet have the reputation, but its defense, led by the standout linebacker Luke Kuechly, ranked ahead of the 49ers’ in yards and points allowed this season. The Panthers’ stellar secondary was aided greatly by a front seven that contributed an N.F.L.-best 60 sacks, including 15 by Greg Hardy. In Week 10, Carolina beat the 49ers in San Francisco by shutting down their offense. But since Week 12, the 49ers have found a different gear, buoyed greatly by finally having healthy wide receivers. They each finished the regular season 12-4. Advertisement The Panthers look like a force for years to come. But at this point, the 49ers have more options on offense, and the team with more playoff experience should be able to win on the road. Pick: 49ers Chargers at Broncos 4:40 p.m. Sunday, CBS Line: Broncos by 10 Whoever thinks San Diego is just happy to be in the playoffs has never watched Philip Rivers stalk the sideline. His intensity, in wins and losses, has inspired legions of admirers and just as many detractors. Rivers’s style of play, big on yards but also prone to mistakes, can be polarizing as well. The only thing everyone agrees on is that his bolo tie was something to behold during a postgame interview last weekend. Although Rivers can win or lose a game by himself, the Chargers’ defense proved more than up to the challenge of handling Denver this season. Peyton Manning led the Broncos (13-3) to an N.F.L.-record 606 points by breaking the records for passing yards and touchdowns. But they split their two games against San Diego and scored fewer than 30 points each time. The only other team to hold Denver under 30 was Kansas City in Week 11. The Broncos are heavily favored for a reason: The Chargers, at 9-7, barely qualified for the playoffs. But the confident Rivers is hardly willing to concede defeat. “This is a heck of a team,” he told reporters, referring to Denver. “It’s rare to play an opponent three times in a season, and being a division opponent, one we know well; they know us well. It’s going to be awesome.” Pick: Broncos Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.

Travel   52 Places to Go in 2014. Advertisement Advertisement Witness a city in transformation, glimpse exotic animals, explore the past and enjoy that beach before the crowds. UPDATED September 5, 2014 A place to meditate on freedom, and the creative life that followed. When Nelson Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island prison, he found inspiration in Cape Town. “We often looked across Table Bay at the magnificent silhouette of Table Mountain,” he said in a speech. “To us on Robben Island, Table Mountain was a beacon of hope. It represented the mainland to which we knew we would one day return.” Cape Town’s importance to Mandela, who made his first address there as a free man, will doubtless draw many visitors in the wake of his death. The country has transformed itself since Mandela’s imprisonment, but there’s still much to be done. Many in Cape Town have been grappling with that challenge, including its creative class, which has been examining whether inspired design can solve some of the issues stemming from years of inequality. The city formally takes up that issue this year during its turn as World Design Capital. Cape Town is celebrating design in all its forms, putting on fashion shows by students and established designers alike, hosting architecture open houses, welcoming the public into artists’ studios and folding the annual visual arts spectacular Design Indaba conference, which took place in February, into the design capital program. Also part of the lineup are locals seeking to rejuvenate impoverished black-majority townships: The Maboneng Lalela Project turns township homes into galleries and performance spaces; Foodpods constructs sustainable farms, giving residents access to healthy produce; and the Langa Quarter project seeks to make the precinct a cultural tourism destination. Cape Town is again reinventing itself, and the world is invited to its renaissance. Facebook Participate The rebirth of a quake-ravaged city. Three years after two large earthquakes devastated central Christchurch, the city is experiencing a rebirth with creativity and wit — thanks to the ingenuity of its hardy residents — and is welcoming tourists back again. Though much of the central city has yet to be rebuilt, entrepreneurs and volunteers are finding surprising ways to make temporary use of empty lots and bring life back to the downtown. The Gap Filler program, begun a couple of months after the first quake in September 2010 and expanded after a more destructive second quake in February 2011, has created a dance floor with coin-operated music and lights and even a nine-hole mini-golf course in vacant lots across the city. The Greening the Rubble campaign has since the 2010 quake been planting temporary gardens on the sites of demolished buildings. To replace the badly damaged 19th-century ChristChurch Cathedral, a magnificent transitional church by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban opened in 2013 with sturdy cardboard tubes for the roof. Businesses are also trickling back downtown. One bar, built inside shipping containers, has a name that encapsulates the spirit of the entire city: Revival. Facebook Participate A glorious new preserve for the public. One hundred and thirty miles north of San Francisco, the moody bluffs of the Mendocino Coast have long been a spectacular place from which to observe marine life: passing humpback whales, sun-happy sea lions, foamy waves strewn with kelp. The incorporation of the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands — nearly 1,300 acres — gives hikers new access to a contiguous 12-mile stretch of coastline and fields of wildflowers, cypress forests and cliff areas (some overlooking dramatic blowholes, pinnacles and sea caves), much of it previously off-limits to the public. And Congressional proposals to include the north coast lands as part of the California Coastal National Monument have passed, which means better protection and more funds for maintenance; plans also exist to extend the California Coastal Trail through the new preserve. Facebook Participate On a rugged shore, Europe at its best. What if you could combine the rugged beauty you’d find on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast with the ruins of an undiscovered Turkey or Greece, all wrapped in the easygoing nature characteristic of rural Italy — at a fraction of the cost? Turns out you can, on the coast of Albania. The roughly Maryland-size country, between Greece and Montenegro, sits about 45 miles east of Italy on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and has limestone-ringed beaches, ancient ruins like Butrint and waterfront inns where you can stay for less than $50 a night. Rampant development threatened to turn it all to concrete in the years after Communism, but a new government took office in 2013 on promises of keeping the coast authentic. Head to villages like Qeparo, within sight of Corfu, where you can kayak past Cold War submarine tunnels, swim by abandoned forts and watch the tide rise during a dinner of fresh fish at an inn called the Riviera. This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap. Facebook Participate Downtown? Really? Yes, thanks to a thriving food scene. Gone is the musty, lifeless, only-open-for-Kings-hockey-games reputation of downtown Los Angeles. While the museums in this corner of the city are thriving (the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art is nearby), the growing dynamism of downtown is the food scene. Most notable is the Grand Central Market, an arcade of over 30 of the best food vendors in the city. Originally built in 1917, the market has been redone in the past year, attracting popular purveyors like G&B Coffee and, soon, Belcampo Meat Co. Just down the street is Alma, which was named the best new restaurant in the country by Bon Appétit magazine. And where there is good food there is good shopping. Stores have added cachet to the neighborhood; an outlet of the fashion label Acne Studios opened in December, and Aesop, a skin-care specialist, in May. Diners and shoppers alike also have a hip place to stay: An Ace Hotel opened early this year. Facebook Participate Africa’s latest conservation success story is a boon for travelers. Namibia’s communal conservancy movement, which pairs sustainable tourism with rural community outreach, has been a much-heralded success: In 2013, the country’s 79 conservancies received the prestigious Gift to the Earth Award from the World Wildlife Fund, and the stunning Namib Sand Sea Desert joined Unesco’s World Heritage list. Options abound for travelers who want to help the effort, including the Desert Rhino Camp, which Wilderness Safaris runs in partnership with the Save the Rhino Trust; the camp directly supports the conservancy, which has reversed dwindling rhino populations. Wilderness Safaris also plans to open the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp, on the Hoanib River in the north. And Namibia’s Tourism Board introduced three self-drive routes this year to point visitors toward less-visited parts of the country. Facebook Participate Epic biodiversity, and a newly renovated railway to get you there. Ecuador is famed as the home of the Galápagos, the beloved islands off the coast that feature mind-boggling wildlife — but the mainland is no slouch either. One of the most biodiverse countries in the world, Ecuador has over 1,600 species of birds, 4,000 kinds of orchids, one of the largest condor shelters on the planet — and one-fifth of the country (including the Galápagos) is protected. And there is a new way to see a good chunk of it: the recently refurbished Tren Crucero. The luxury vintage train starts in Quito (the first city ever to be declared a World Heritage site by Unesco) and travels through the Andes, over snow-capped mountains, past volcanoes, around a harrowing turn called the Devil’s Nose and through the countryside until arriving in the bustling city of Guayaquil. The four-day trip includes an excursion to Cotopaxi National Park — a place where you might see deer, wolves, bears or one of those condors. Facebook Participate Now open: One of the world’s largest caves. Son Doong Cave in the Quang Binh province of central Vietnam is one of the world’s largest caves and is now, for the first time, accessible to tourists, thanks to the tour operator Oxalis. Huge shafts of light penetrate its vast caverns, allowing forests of 100-foot-tall trees to thrive in spaces big enough to accommodate 40-story skyscrapers. Colossal 260-foot stalactites are also present. Monkeys, hornbills and flying foxes have all been spotted in this surreal habitat, first fully explored in 2009. While trips into Son Doong are limited in number (only 220 permits for the year) and to visitors with deep pockets (over $6,000 per trip), the nearby and more affordable Tu Lan Cave is also now open to adventurous travelers. Facebook Participate For Australian panache, go west. Perth, the capital of western Australia, has long been feted for its beaches, laid-back vibe and Aboriginal heritage, but lately Australia’s fourth-largest city is exhibiting the signs of a trendy transformation. Regional wine lists? Check. Modish new restaurants in repurposed spaces like stables (the Stables Bar), cottages (the Old Crow) or a printing press building (the Print Hall)? Check. International celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver, whose Italian spot Jamie’s Italian recently opened? Up-and-coming neighborhoods like Mount Lawley and Northbridge, chockablock with cafes and vintage shops? Check and check. Transformation is evident on a larger scale, too: The Riverside project is infusing the eastern side of the city with parks, shops and housing plazas, while expansion of the new Crown Perth complex includes hotels — Crown Metropol and Crown Promenade — and posh restaurants like Nobu and La Vie Champagne Lounge. Now that first- and business-class lounges have opened at Los Angeles International Airport this year, the national airline Qantas makes it easy to get Down Under in style. Facebook Participate First-class architecture in the Netherlands’ second city. Post-World War II reconstruction has changed the face of one of Europe’s largest ports, where striking, cubed architecture gives shape to the most modern skyline in the country. But it’s not done yet. This is a banner year for ribbon cuttings to celebrate both new and reconfigured space: An overhaul of Rotterdam Centraal  train station in March has already unveiled a new shop-lined pedestrian passageway and the city’s first Starbucks. The renovated Kunsthal museum reopened in February. François Geurds, chef of the two-Michelin-starred restaurant FG, opened another restaurant in January. Come December, the massive arch of the Markthal, whose interior displays 3-D food photographs, becomes the country’s first indoor food hall. Need a launching pad? Check into a brand-new gem: the Rem Koolhaas-designed nhow hotel. Facebook Participate Urban and outdoor pursuits in one (reasonably) compact package. The traveler who wants to do it all should consider Taiwan. This island, roughly the size of the Netherlands, has an easy-to-navigate public transport network that links a cosmopolitan capital with a bounty of natural and man-made wonders. Taipei, whose robust art scene recently earned its selection as the World Design Capital for 2016, has more places to lay your head: A boutique hotel from the homegrown bookstore chain Eslite will join the recent arrivals Mandarin Oriental, Le Meridien and W. All of these should be a convenient base from which to do some sightseeing on 17 bike trails along the shores of Taipei’s many rivers and inlets or to take a foray into the city’s vibrant street food scene with a nightcap at the reservations-only bespoke bar Alchemy, which opened in 2012 to much acclaim. Four hours south by high-speed rail and bus, 70-square-mile Kenting National Park is home to wetlands, white sands, fishing villages and, starting this year, a ferry point for the deep sea fishing and diving paradise of Orchid Island. Up north in Keelung, a new National Museum of Marine Science and Technology has opened, part of a revitalization project at Badouzi Harbor, which is linked to nearby headlands by color-coded walking routes. And it all becomes cheaper to get to later this year, with the launch of budget carriers from China Airlines and TransAsia Airways. Facebook Participate An infusion of hip night life wakes up a humdrum city. Frankfurt, long considered strictly a financial capital and major travel hub, used to land on the culturati map once a year, during its annual book fair. A recent boom of restaurants and clubs, though, makes the case for permanent placement. Leading the city’s transformation is its fast-evolving red light district, where spots like Maxie Eisen, a deli-style cafe by day and a speakeasy-inspired bar by night, offer a sexiness that isn’t unseemly. In the city center, a buzzy pan-Asian restaurant called Moriki was just opened by the Berlin-based chef Duc Ngo with a menu that includes envelope-pushing courses like sushi pizza; and the new sleek Lamoraga, a modern Spanish restaurant, is pulling in the shopping crowds for lunch. By the end of next year, the developer Ardi Goldman plans to reinvent and reopen the famed King Kamehameha Club, which had its original heyday in the 1990s and 2000s. And growth extends to the art world: The 32,000-square-foot underground extension at the Städel Museum earned accolades from around the globe when it opened last year. Facebook Participate An ambitious art scene heads toward the international stage. Building on a strong historical legacy (Addis boasts one of East Africa’s oldest art schools) are a host of events scheduled for 2014: a photography festival, two film festivals and a jazz and world music festival. Thanks to the city’s diverse art institutions and galleries, including the artist-in-residence village Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the Asni Gallery (really more an art collective than a gallery), there is an art opening at least once a week. Even the local Sheraton puts on “Art of Ethiopia,” an annual show of new talent. But it’s the National Museum that, in May and June, hosted this year’s blockbuster exhibit, “Ras Tafari: The Majesty and the Movement,” devoted to Emperor Haile Selassie I and Rastafarianism. Facebook Participate A world-class World Cup getaway. Now that the World Cup is over, escape to Fernando de Noronha, a 21-island archipelago about 330 miles off the coast of one of the host cities, Recife. Here you’ll find 250-foot-high black cliffs muscling against peach-sand beaches, Portuguese hilltop forts and blue coves where humpbacks and spinner dolphins linger. Only one of the islands, Noronha, is inhabited, and the entire chain is protected as a park with just 246 visitors allowed per day. Regulations have kept Noronha relaxed, with only small hotels and roads rough enough to make dune buggies the rental cars of choice. Hike along cliffs to gorgeous beaches like Sancho, dive with sea turtles or climb Morro do Pico, a 1,059-foot-high volcanic pinnacle. Facebook Participate Leather jackets and skinny jeans join cowboy boots. Country music lovers have long made the pilgrimage to Nashville, but now the city has fast gained cachet among rock fans and foodies. The city’s vibrant scene is home to the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Jeff the Brotherhood and Diarrhea Planet, who all play in town occasionally. And a youthquake is transforming scruffy neighborhoods like 12South and East Nashville into hipster hubs. New hangouts include Pinewood Social, a bar, restaurant, bowling alley and karaoke joint, and the 404, a restaurant and boutique hotel in a former auto garage. Add to that a thriving culinary scene, exemplified by the Music City Eats Festival, back for a second year in September. And Nashville’s old standbys — like the honky-tonk Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and the venerable Ryman — are as fun as ever. Facebook Participate New reasons to play, and watch players, in Scotland’s yards. Riddled with lochs and crested by moody Highlands, Scotland adds to its already considerable outdoorsy appeal this year. In April, the John Muir Way, named for the conservationist originally from Scotland, expanded to 134 miles from 45 miles, newly spanning the farmland and forests of the country’s midsection. Organizers estimate it will take eight to 12 days on foot or four to six by bike to complete the coast-to-coast route running from Muir’s boyhood hometown Dunbar west to the Loch Lomond area. The attractions extend beyond amateur workouts. This summer, Glasgow staged the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Olympic-style competitions for Britain and the former British colonies, and in September Gleneagles resort in the Highlands will host the Ryder Cup golf competition. Sports and hospitality meet at Cromlix House Hotel, a 15-room resort that the tennis champion and local hero Andy Murray opened earlier this year in a Victorian mansion in Dunblane. Facebook Participate An oil boom town gets its cultural legs. Flush with oil money, Calgary has morphed from ho-hum city on the prairie into a cultural hub, with offerings far beyond the Stampede, the annual rodeo and festival. Locals stroll over the tubular Peace Bridge, designed by Santiago Calatrava, opened in 2012. Public art is part of life; in 2013 Jaume Plensa completed Wonderland, a 39-foot-tall steel mesh head installed in front of the new skyline-transforming Norman Foster-designed Bow Tower. They join beloved cultural institutions like the One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theater, whose dancer and choreographer Denise Clarke was in December named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors. Facebook Participate Sand and surf, now a (low-cost) hop from Osaka. The yen is the weakest it’s been against the dollar in years, putting Japan more within reach in 2014. For low prices coupled with laid-back attitudes, look way south to the island of Ishigaki, 250 miles south of Okinawa Island and far from the bustle of Tokyo. The 85-square-mile island, largely undiscovered, is home to sunburned surfers, sandy beaches and beautiful coral reefs. And it’s never been easier to reach: A new airport opened here in March 2013, and Japan’s new low-cost carrier, Peach, just began service from Osaka. Facebook Participate A pristine slice of biodiversity is home to a new luxury eco-resort. Set between Mount Kenya and the Great Rift Valley, the Laikipia Plateau teems with wildlife: elephants, leopards, endangered rhinos and one of the highest concentrations of zebras on the continent. Now the area has also become a conservation success story, sustained and protected through an unusual mix of public and private partnerships and a network of environmentally minded ranchers. With the 2013 opening of Segera, a resort owned by Jochen Zeitz, a German-born executive, there is also a new spot to admire its pristine landscapes. The 50,000-acre property includes an enviable collection of contemporary African art, an organic and solar-powered farm and a wine collection focusing on African labels. And more sustainable travel may be on the horizon: A new national park on the area’s southwestern border has been proposed by the government. Facebook Participate A volcano, a temple, a shrine and now a place to stay. This central Javan sultanate draws crowds for its proximity to bewitching attractions: the monumental, wedding cake-esque Buddhist temple Borobudur, the soft-serve-ice-cream-shaped Hindu shrines of Prambanan, and pre-sunrise hikes to summit Indonesia’s friskiest volcano, Mount Merapi (which most recently erupted in 2013). But finding a decent room has never been easy, until now. Thanks to tax breaks for hotel development, 20 new starred hotels, to complement the city’s existing 30, will open through 2015. Among them are Zest Hotel (a Swiss-Belhotel brand) at the end of 2014 and, according to a director of the Tourism Promotion Agency of Yogyakarta, three new properties from Accor, whose brands include Sofitel and ibis. Facebook Participate A ski area spruces up with new terrain, lodging and an entire base village. For decades Northstar-at-Tahoe, on the north end of Lake Tahoe, was a mostly overlooked ski hill. Since 2004, however, more than $1 billion has poured into the resort. Though weather in the region has been fickle so far this season, the improvements are impressive. And they aren’t limited to the base village that has risen at the renamed Northstar, centered around a huge ice rink ringed by couches and fire pits. The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe opened a few years ago, and Vail Resorts, since buying the ski resort in late 2010, has built an on-mountain day lodge, added more terrain and installed the new Promised Land Express lift on the resort’s Backside. Tahoe is resurgent, as resorts from Squaw Valley to Homewood undertake improvements with an eye toward bidding for the 2026 Winter Olympics. In the next few years expect to see everything from the Cal Neva Resort, once owned by Frank Sinatra, open after a big renovation, to a South Lake Tahoe with new waterfront hotels. Facebook Participate A photogenic (and historic) ale trail. The sprawling northern county of Yorkshire is becoming a big destination for beer lovers, thanks to a recently published guidebook called “Great Yorkshire Beer” and a renewed interest in historic breweries like Samuel Smith (founded in 1758) and Timothy Taylor (from 1858). Spend an evening crawling through the Fat Cat, the Kelham Island Tavern and other award-winning pubs in Sheffield — recently called Britain’s best beer city by the connoisseur Adrian Tierney-Jones — then travel to Leeds, whose compact center is home to the Victoria Hotel, the Cross Keys and other public houses that pull pints on traditional hand pumps. A final stay in the photogenic city of York offers a Tudor-style pub at the end of every cobbled lane, as well as modern beer temples like York Tap, Pivni and the House of Trembling Madness. Facebook Participate Reborn, relentless and still over the top. Five years ago, one of the planet’s most ambitious cities appeared to be dying. Crushed with debt, Dubai found its megaprojects and skyscrapers scuttled or scrapped. The city went from juggernaut to joke. But now, it’s back. Economically surging, Dubai has won its bid to host World Expo 2020 and has unveiled its Tourism Vision, also for 2020, a plan to attract 20 million tourists — double the current crowd. Last October witnessed the first passenger terminal at Dubai World Central Al Maktoum International Airport, and travelers will discover colossal new hotels like the 555-room Conrad Dubai and the 77-story JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, which Guinness World Records recognizes as the tallest hotel in the world. This year, a new tram system will be inaugurated, along with some theme parks, including the first phase of Dubai Adventure Studios, the first phase of IMG Worlds of Adventure, and Holy Quran Park (devoted to the Islamic holy book). Facebook Participate New saints, a new(ish) pope and newly restored treasures beckon. Pope Francis, who has nearly 4.8 million followers on Twitter and routinely makes headlines for doing things like inviting atheists to join the cause for peace in his Christmas message, is widely viewed as reinvigorating the scandal-plagued, conservative-leaning Roman Catholic Church. (Just ask Time magazine, which last December named him the 2013 Person of the Year.) The first South American pope is so popular that the Vatican estimated that nearly a million visitors came in April for Holy Week and the canonization of John XXIII and John Paul II. Services commemorating the new saints will continue throughout the year. The faithful can also enjoy the fruits of restorations that have taken years, like that of Bernini’s colonnade in St. Peter’s Square and the reopening of the Via Triumphalis necropolis, a vast ancient Roman cemetery first uncovered in the 1950s. And pilgrims can stay up-to-date on news and events, including restorations and exhibitions, thanks to the Pope’s new mobile app. Facebook Participate South American beach towns, before they go upscale. Around glamorous Punta del Este and boho-chic José Ignacio, there’s no deficiency of boutique hotels, expat art galleries and exclusive waterfront brasseries. But farther east along the Uruguayan Riviera, a relatively untrodden stretch of Atlantic coast tucked between Argentina and Brazil, sun, sand and simplicity remain the draw — for now. In the Rocha region, villages like Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, San Antonio and Punta del Diablo are just starting to attract serious international attention, bringing a sprinkling of first-rate accommodation — like Brisas, a clifftop 14-room inn restored by an Argentine tech mogul — without compromising the area’s natural charms: miles of undeveloped beach, rolling pastures and a culture where gaucho cowboys and fishermen with wooden boats aren’t just props. Facebook Participate A cultural capital springs to life. Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu (and formerly known as Madras), was long considered the gateway to popular South Indian tourist destinations like Kerala but was overlooked as an attraction itself. It is, however, a national cultural capital and home to several dance and music schools like Kalakshetra for dance and the Music Academy for Carnatic South Indian music, which both regularly hold performances around town. There are also historic sites aplenty, including the Kapaleeswarar Temple, built in the name of the Hindu god Shiva. Fresh buzz makes this city especially enticing: Several major hotels including the Park Hyatt have recently opened, and there is a slew of new and trendy clubs, boutiques and restaurants, including Ottimo for excellent pizzas. Facebook Participate An African luxury hot spot that’s become easier to get to. This archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean now has one of the world’s most expensive hotels. The listed price for a villa at the North Island resort, on a private island where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed during their honeymoon, ranges from 2,582 to 4,079 euros (about $3,670 to $5,800) per night; the Doubletree by Hilton Seychelles, which opened last year is, thankfully, more affordable. The appeal goes beyond pampering and powdery beaches: The Seychelles is also home to some 100,000 giant Aldabra tortoises that live on a coral atoll that is a Unesco World Heritage site. Air Seychelles recently signed code-share agreements with Air Berlin, Cathay Pacific Airways and other airlines, making these islands about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Africa more accessible. Facebook Participate A Phuket-like hideaway, but still unspoiled. The southern Thailand town of Krabi lies just a 45-minute boat ride across the Andaman Sea from Phuket. But you can spare yourself the trip to Phuket — plenty of riches lie here, and you don’t have to fight the crowds to enjoy them. Krabi sits next to the Mu Koh Lanta National Park, a prime spot for hiking, rock climbing and elephant trekking. If you do get restless, there are about 130 pristine islands nearby that are ripe for exploration and virtually undeveloped save for a few ancient monasteries. And Krabi, which used to have few options for accommodations and was hard to get to, is now more tourist-friendly. A number of hotels have opened in recent years, including Phulay Bay, a Ritz-Carlton property. A marina, Port Takola, is in the works and will be home to restaurants, night life and shopping, and a new terminal that has opened at Krabi Airport means that there are more flights to and from this gem. Facebook Participate Ditch those poles. Art and bike trails await. This ski town has a big development off-piste: The long-awaited reinvented Aspen Art Museum opened its doors this summer. The 33,000-square-foot space, designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, is meant to reflect the mountain experience. Visitors first take a lift to the roof and take in the view from the sculpture garden before descending to tour the galleries. There is also plenty of news for outdoor types this year, too, with new mountain biking trails planned throughout Aspen and Snowmass, a new mountain skills center and expanded lift-serviced biking. Facebook Participate Natural wonders are in danger. Go see them before it’s too late. The Icelandic government has spent decades protecting its glaciers, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and permafrost mounds in the Thjorsarver Wetlands, part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of the entire country, mostly in the interior. But last year, the government announced plans to revoke those protections, allowing for the construction of hydropower plants (instead of glaciers and free-flowing rivers, imagine man-made reservoirs, dams, paved roads and power lines). “If they get into this area, there will be no way to stop them from destroying the wetlands completely,” said Arni Finnsson, the chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. If you ever want to see Iceland in all of its famously raw natural beauty, go now. Facebook Participate Soundscapes and culture shine in northern Sweden. A hotbed of hardcore and heavy metal music through the 1990s, this northern city has welcomed all genres during its tenure as a European Capital of Culture this year. Music has taken center stage at outdoor opera performances, a crowdsourced music festival and an orchestral tribute to the local hardcore band Refused. Visual arts focused on the culture of indigenous Sami people are on exhibit at Bildmuseet, the city’s contemporary arts museum that reopened in 2012 in a glass-and-wood building designed by Henning Larsen Architects. And it’s all easier to reach thanks to a new higher-speed rail connection from Stockholm. Facebook Participate Skip smog-choked cities — and face masks — and head out to China’s wild frontier. With pollution skyrocketing in China’s showcase cities, visitors to the country are increasingly seeking out greener pastures to explore. Set deep in the tropics of southern Yunnan province, Xishuangbanna is about as lush as you can get — the region boasts the richest biodiversity in China, including some of the country’s last wild elephants. In February 2013, the area went upscale with its first five-star hotel — the Anantara Xishuangbanna Resort & Spa, which organizes tea-leaf picking trips in mountainside plantations. More action-oriented experiences are possible, as well, such as the tour group WildChina’s jungle biking trips or treks along the caravan route plied by tea traders centuries ago. Facebook Participate A mountain makeover from overlooked to opulent. Andermatt has long been a quiet town of Alpine farmers and bargain-seeking skiers. But the former Swiss Army outpost began its transformation into a bona fide ski destination with the opening last December of the Chedi Andermatt. The 104-room resort, housed in a modernized chalet with a Japanese restaurant among several dining options, indoor and outdoor pools and a 10-treatment-room spa, is just the first phase of a big new development of apartment buildings, homes, five more hotels and a golf course in the coming years over 321 acres. The pedestrian village will offer skiers access by gondola to the nearly 9,800-foot Gemsstock Mountain, with future lifts to the larger nearby ski area of Sedrun planned to open in 2015. Facebook Participate In the land of cars, cycling (and culture) get the limelight. An urban cycling model has arrived in Indianapolis: the new $63 million, eight-mile bike-friendly Indy Cultural Trail. The path connects five downtown neighborhoods, including arty Fountain Square, to top downtown sites, including the Capitol Building, City Market and White River State Park, a 250-acre park that hosts the Indianapolis Zoo and six more major attractions. Bicycles can be rented along the paved and lighted pathway, allowing riders to cruise past public art, including a motion-activated fireflylike swarm of LED lights. City officials say that planners from Cologne, Germany, to Portland, Ore., have come to see how the city most famous for a 500-mile car race managed to swap auto for bike lanes and still keep everything rolling smoothly. Facebook Participate River cruising swells on the Danube of Asia. Like the Danube in Europe, the Mekong River in Southeast Asia has become a vital river cruising course, with a variety of small-ship itineraries linking Vietnam and Cambodia. Late last year, Pandaw River Expeditions upgraded two of its ships, the Mekong Pandaw and Tonle Pandaw, enlarging public spaces, adding gyms and stocking cabins with iPads. In 2012, the company launched the 32-guest Angkor Pandaw, offering three- to seven-night itineraries, while Avalon Waterways set the 32-passenger Avalon Angkor sailing between Ho Chi Minh City and Siem Reap over seven nights. In September, Aqua Expeditions will introduce the 20-suite Aqua Mekong, offering guide-led shore excursions to temples, villages and wildlife-rich areas via skiffs. Facebook Participate Out of an economic crisis, a city surges back. Vibrancy and innovation can bloom even in hard times. Exhibit A is Greece’s ancient capital, which was hit hard by the global economic crisis and yet is seeing change at sites old and new. First the old: At the Acropolis, the famous Caryatids statues continue to get a restoration in 2014. And the new: The National Museum of Contemporary Art will soon open in a former brewery complex. Neighborhoods have also seen a resurgence, including the quickly gentrifying Monastiraki and the still gritty Kerameikos-Metaxourgeio; the latter will get a cultural lift in 2015 from the biannual ReMap art event. Travelers will have a new lodging option by the end of the year, when a revived Emporikon Hotel opens on Aiolou, a street that is also home to a host of new dining spots. Facebook Participate A scenic, low-key destination on the verge of discovery. Most vacationers to La Republica hole up in the all-inclusives north and east, overlooking the rarely traveled southwest. The port town of Barahona is the gateway to the cactus-strewn region’s riches, like the hauntingly beautiful Bahia de las Aguilas beach and the eight climate zones at the geological depression Hoyo de Pelempito, both blissfully devoid of people. But there are signs of the government’s vision to develop the area. The abandoned former Barcelo Bahoruco Beach Resort will partly open at the end of 2014, and two separate 300-room projects — near La Canoa and San Rafael Beach — are in the final stages of design approval. For now, you can experience the quiet life at the thatch-roofed Casa Bonita, or at Rancho Platon, which has a tree house raised between the palms. Facebook Participate Chasing the northern lights? This might be the year. There aren't many reasons to visit the frigid region surrounding the North Pole, but the darkest months, from September through March, offer the most stunning of them: northern lights, that colorful spectacle of solar particles entering our atmosphere. And there are some comfortable ways to see them, thanks to hotels offering northern lights safaris, including the newly opened Ion Luxury Adventure Hotel in Iceland and the Icehotel in Swedish Lapland (and actually within the Arctic Circle). Facebook Participate On the African coast, music thrives in a commercial capital. Tanzania may be best known for the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro and the game-packed plains of the Serengeti, but the real pulse of the country is found in its largest city, Dar es Salaam. An eclectic mix of music echoes through the beach clubs, open-air bars and nightclubs of this Indian Ocean coastal city. Old-school dance music competes with Swahili hip-hop and traditional drumming, all drawing from the city’s African, Indian and Arab influences. Add in the street food, the beaches and the fact that the year-old African low-cost carrier Fastjet uses Dar as its hub, and it’s easy to see that this commercial capital is more than a stopover on the way to Tanzania’s natural splendor. It is an African metropolis coming into its own. Facebook Participate A revitalized city center welcomes new museums and streetcars. Atlanta plans several ribbon cuttings in 2014, but the main event is the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, opened in June next to the Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia Aquarium downtown. The 42,000-square-foot, environmentally friendly museum features permanent galleries devoted to domestic and international rights struggles and houses the Martin Luther King Jr. papers owned by Morehouse College. By November, visitors will be able to take the new Atlanta Streetcar on a 2.7-mile loop that will link the park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and other stops. Another parkside attraction, the 94,000-square-foot College Football Hall of Fame, is opening in time for fall kickoff of the N.C.A.A. season. Facebook Participate Skiing, soba and snow monkeys. For nearly a century, visitors have been lured to this ski destination, a 90-minute drive from Nagano, by affordability and a host of charms: fine powder, long slopes and charming cobblestone lanes lined with traditional ryokan inns, generations-old soba noodle shops and natural hot spring baths. But the recent arrival of stylish, foreigner-friendly restaurants, cafes and bars have infused the area with new energy, offering travelers just the right mix of old and new. Microbrews and excellent coffee are served at ski-in/ski-out Craft Room, while Tamon prepares innovative kaiseki cuisine using local ingredients. The lantern-hung rooms at Jon Nobi are popular among international skiers, as is its chic izakaya restaurant Himatsuri, inspired by the town’s fire festival, held annually on Jan. 15. The Asian operator Backyard Travel offers 10-day itineraries to explore Nozawa and nearby sights like a seventh-century temple and a refuge for the area’s famed snow monkeys. Facebook Participate Serbian wine? Time to take a sip. The Balkan Peninsula has a wine culture that dates back hundreds of years, but war and political unrest over the last century decimated Serbian vineyards. As recently as a decade ago, Serbia produced virtually no wine that met international standards. But progress has been swift. Recently, small producers have revived the Subotica-Horgos wine region near the northern border with Hungary. Here, the Palic Wine Route has been attracting domestic wine tourists who spend days sampling local cabernet sauvignon in wine cellars, sipping dry Trijumf white during dinner at Bosscaffe and unwinding in the Hotel Galleria‘s high-tech spa. Facebook Participate A museum’s entrance makes for something new in the state of Denmark. Even angst-ridden Prince Hamlet, literature’s most famous Dane, might be cheered by the new Maritime Museum of Denmark, which recently opened in his hometown Elsinore. Designed by the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, the glassy structure is built into a U-shaped dry dock and filled with slanted floors and zigzag passageways that evoke ocean-rocked ships’ decks. Maritime relics — from torpedoes to Lego pirate ships — mix with electronic maps and films that explore the romance of the sea, shipboard existence and trade, both centuries ago and today. Interactive exhibits allow you to run your own trade company, navigate by the stars and ink a sailor’s tattoo. For additional watery wonders, head to Copenhagen’s new Blue Planet aquarium, billed as the largest in Northern Europe. Facebook Participate Haute cuisine comes to the lush landscapes of the Lake District. The British dining scene is expanding beyond London, and the chef Simon Rogan deserves much of the credit, having helped elevate the Lake District village of Cartmel into one of England’s most unlikely culinary destinations. His three restaurants in the medieval village — the Michelin two-starred L’Enclume, Rogan & Company and his most recent addition, the Pig & Whistle — have menus featuring whatever’s fresh on his nearby farm. Cartmel is also home to a celebrated farmers’ market, Cartmel Cheeses and the Cartmel Village shop, renowned for its sticky toffee pudding. What’s more, the village is a cozy base from which to explore the Lake District, once an inspiration to William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter. Facebook Participate New peaks open up for alpine adventurers. This Himalayan republic is the mother lode of alpinism, home to eight of the world’s 10 highest summits (including Everest). So when a Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation subcommittee recommended last September that Nepal allow access to 165 new peaks in the Kanchenjunga massif this year — 13 of them above 23,000 feet — the world’s mountaineering community was aflutter. Some welcomed the announcement, while others dismissed it, saying the government had stretched the meaning of “peak” in a few cases to include subpeaks within mountains that were already accessible in order to rake in more in fees. Even so, the proposal was significant since it was the first such release in a decade. And though the government scaled back the scope of the original proposal, it did formally open 104 of the new peaks in May. Facebook Participate Feel like reminiscing? A city is awash in anniversaries. Vienna is home to some 450 balls each year, from traditional waltzes to the “seriously outlandish” Rosenball for the gay community, and this year is the 200th anniversary since the city’s ball culture took root. You could mark the occasion by attending one, but it wouldn’t be the only date to celebrate in the capital city this year. Visitors can pay homage at the Sigmund Freud Museum since it has been 75 years since the psychoanalyst’s death. The city is also commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War I with special exhibits and the European Peace Walk, a permanent route from Vienna to Trieste through five countries. There are also new art spaces, a new transportation hub, more direct flights from the United States and offbeat places to stay, like Urbanauts’ former storefronts or Chez Cliché’s themed apartments, with décor inspired by fictional hosts, such as Marie Therese, who loves Baroque furnishings and classical music. Facebook Participate Even a 1,200-year-old lost city has some new draws. If you’ve seen the temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, then the country’s lost city of Mahendraparvata, its majestic temples on Phnom Kulen and the stone animal carvings at the site of Srah Damrei (elephant pond) should be next on your list. About 30 miles from Siem Reap, Mahendraparvata predates Angkor Wat by about 350 years and was the birthplace of the Khmer Empire in A.D. 802. Although the city has been known about for several decades, researchers in 2013 discovered new temples and a network of roads and dikes that had been concealed under thick mountain vegetation. Facebook Participate Croatia’s architectural and musical gem lies inland. Forget Croatia’s beloved coast: The inland city Varazdin is one of the country’s most picturesque and well-preserved areas. One hour north of Zagreb, this small metropolis of 50,000 has an immaculate cobblestoned town center and is stocked with Baroque churches and palaces like the Draskovic. The theme continues with an annual Baroque music festival, but that’s where it ends. Other music-themed festivals and concerts are decidedly modern and change from year to year: One, the Radar Festival, for contemporary stars, has drawn names such as Bob Dylan and Carlos Santana, and various other festivals throughout the year such as Spancir Fest, celebrated from the end of August to September, attract artists and musicians from around Europe. Facebook Participate Reinventing a Florida city’s reputation. Once mocked for its thousands of green benches dotted with senior citizens, St. Petersburg is anything but stationary. With a redeveloped waterfront, a stunning Dali Museum, and sophisticated restaurants in place, the downtown energy is now heading up historic Central Avenue, thanks in part to the craft beer scene. Among the many recent arrivals, artsy Cycle Brewing features Fixie and Endo ales, while Green Bench Brewing Co., the name a nod to those erstwhile icons, invites winter escapees to its sunny taproom and beer garden. Refuel at the ambitious Rococo Steak, set in a renovated 1920s YWCA, then hit the Tap Room of the reinvented Hollander Hotel. Facebook Participate More flights and lodges in Central America’s eco-frontier. Twenty years ago, when Francis Ford Coppola opened Blancaneaux Lodge in western Belize, relatively few travelers had ventured into this small Central American country. Slowly they arrived, many of them curious to witness the scenery that had captivated the film director, which he described in an email as “completely remote, with a beautiful pristine river you could drink the water out of and the most star-studded night sky I had ever seen.” Since then, upscale rustic hotels have cropped up all over Belize — there’s El Secreto in Ambergris Caye, for example, and Belcampo, an eco-lodge and sustainable farm in the south that’s about to unveil a sophisticated redesign — adding to the lure of rain forests, Mayan ruins and coral reefs. It helps that Belize is easier to reach: Delta recently began nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Belize City, and regional carriers like Tropic Air have expanded their routes, connecting Belize to resorts like Cancún and making remote towns like San Ignacio more accessible. Facebook Participate What you’d expect (natural beauty) and not (world-class museum). This semisecret gem of the South Pacific, a three-hour flight from Sydney, is attracting visitors like never before. Thank infrastructural upgrades like a refurbished international airport, improved roads and bridges, and the arrival of high-profile properties like the new Hilton Noumea La Promenade Residences and the Sheraton New Caledonia Deva Resort & Spa. An island itinerary reads like a fantasy novel: snorkeling and diving in one of the world’s largest lagoons, an aquamarine stunner populated by thousands of coral and marine species and home to the world’s second largest reef (after the Great Barrier); horseback riding through verdant mountains and indigenous Kanak villages; kayaking by moonlight among the submerged forest of the Blue River Provincial Park. The cosmopolitan capital, Nouméa, has its own allures, like Le Roof, where you might spot dolphins diving in the distance while savoring the fresh oysters, and the Tjibaou Cultural Center, a Renzo Piano-designed museum housing one of the world’s largest collections of Pacific art. Facebook Participate Once a kitsch capital, now earning a reputation for food and sports. Known for its remarkable natural beauty and tourist kitsch, Niagara Falls is now evolving into a draw for those who love food as well as those who seek thrills. The Niagara Falls Culinary Institute opened a high-end restaurant, deli, patisserie and gelateria steps from the American Falls, transforming the area’s dining scene overnight. A gastro pub called the Griffon Pub, which features 50 beers on tap and creative New American dishes like gnocchi poutine, opened a few miles east of the falls last year. On the Canadian side, oenophiles can get a taste of the region’s growing wine scene just a short bike ride from the falls along the Niagara River Recreation Trail. Nondining attractions are plentiful, too. This year, Canadians have hosted two major War of 1812 bicentennial re-enactments in the area, and since May visitors have been able to see the falls from a new luxury catamaran. Tourism officials on the Canadian side appear poised to allow daredevils to zip line across or rappel down the Niagara Gorge later this year.

The Thjorsarver Wetlands in Iceland are part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of Iceland. The wetlands themselves do not constitute 40 percent of the country. Two of the airlines scheduled to provide budget service to Taiwan are China Airlines, not China Airways, and TransAsia Airways, not TransAsia Air.

Business   Appeals Court Upholds BP Oil Spill Settlement. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSJAN. 10, 2014 NEW ORLEANS — Over BP’s objections, a federal appeals court on Friday upheld a judge’s approval of the company’s multibillion-dollar settlement with lawyers for businesses and residents who claim the immense 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico cost them money. BP has argued that Judge Carl Barbier of Federal District Court and the court-appointed claims administrator, Patrick Juneau, have misinterpreted settlement terms in ways that would force the oil giant, based in London, to pay for billions of dollars in inflated or false claims by businesses. During a hearing in November before a three-judge panel of the Fifth Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, a BP lawyer argued that Judge Barbier’s 2012 approval of the deal should not stand unless the company ultimately prevails in its continuing dispute over business payments. But the divided panel ruled on Friday that Judge Barbier did not err by failing to determine more than a year ago whether the class of eligible claimants included individuals who have not actually suffered any injury related to the spill. Affirming Judge Barbier’s 2012 ruling, the court said in its 48-page majority opinion that it could not agree with arguments raised by BP and others who separately objected to the settlement. Advertisement “No case cited by BP or the objectors suggests that a district court must also safeguard the interests of the defendant, which in most settlements can protect its own interests at the negotiating table,” the ruling says. BP did not immediately comment on the decision on Friday. One of the three appellate judges, Emilio M. Garza, disagreed with the majority in a 14-page dissent, saying the “attempted global settlement fails in a narrow, but significant, regard” and should be vacated so it can be fixed. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have argued that BP simply undervalued the settlement and underestimated how many claimants would be eligible for payments. “Today’s ruling is an enormous victory for the Gulf, and an important step forward in ensuring that every eligible claimant is fully compensated according to the objective, transparent formulas detailed in the settlement agreement that BP co-authored and agreed to,” said lawyers for plaintiffs, Steve Herman and Jim Roy, who negotiated the settlement and urged the Fifth Circuit to uphold it.

Foreign   New Clashes Erupt in Ukraine After Trial. Advertisement Advertisement By DAVID M. HERSZENHORNJAN. 10, 2014 At least a dozen protesters were injured in clashes with riot police in Kiev after a Ukrainian court on Friday convicted three men of plotting to topple a statue of Vladimir Lenin in 2011 in Boryspil, a city southeast of the capital. The protesters had denounced the prosecution of the three men as politically motivated and a “show trial” and pointed to evidence showing that the Boryspil City Council had voted to remove the Lenin statue even before the alleged plot was discovered. About 100 protesters had gathered at the courthouse in Kiev for the verdict. The clashes began after the three defendants were sentenced to six years in prison. Among the injured was Yuri V. Lutsenko, a former interior minister and an outspoken opposition leader who helped coordinate the recent mass demonstrations in central Kiev against the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich. Local news agencies reported that Mr. Lutsenko had been knocked unconscious. Mr. Lutsenko, who was also an organizer of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is the leader of an opposition party called the Third Ukrainian Republic.

Business   For Financier, a Final Try to Avoid U.S. Charges. Advertisement Advertisement By JACK EWINGJAN. 12, 2014 A lawyer for Florian Homm, a German financier wanted by United States authorities, says he will appeal to the Italian Ministry of Justice in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the former hedge fund manager from being extradited to Los Angeles to face charges of securities fraud. On Friday, Italy’s highest court cleared the way for Mr. Homm, 54, to be sent to Los Angeles for trial on federal charges that he defrauded investors of at least $200 million. The most serious of the four felony counts carry maximum sentences of 25 years in prison. The last hope for Mr. Homm, who was arrested on United States charges in Italy last year after five years in hiding, is that the Italian Ministry of Justice will block the extradition, but that is considered unlikely. Mr. Homm’s lawyers argued that he has multiple sclerosis and is not healthy enough to withstand the stress of extradition and trial. Mr. Homm “firmly believes he will be exonerated, but we are gravely concerned about his ability to survive this ordeal,” Jan Lawrence Handzlik, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Mr. Homm, said on Saturday in an emailed statement. The Italian court also rejected a plea by Mr. Homm to be transferred to a civilian hospital. Mr. Homm, who holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Harvard, has been held in jails in Florence and Pisa since his arrest in March at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, where he planned to rendezvous with family members. Mr. Homm does not face any charges in Germany and would have been safe from extradition if he had remained there. Advertisement While denying he has committed any crimes, Mr. Homm often seems to revel in his own notoriety. While in hiding, he published a book, “Rogue Financier: The Adventures of an Estranged Capitalist,” in which he recalled, with some regret, his exploits as a predatory investor who shook up the staid world of German industry in the 1990s. Mr. Homm later became part owner of Borussia Dortmund, one of the country’s top soccer teams. Mr. Homm cultivated a flamboyant public persona in Germany, appearing on talk shows chomping his trademark Cuban cigar, before he abruptly dropped from view in 2007 amid the collapse of the portfolio of hedge funds he founded, Absolute Capital Management Holdings. After years spent mostly in Colombia, according to Mr. Homm’s account, he reappeared last year, promoting his book in a series of clandestine interviews. Since 2011, Mr. Homm has been the target of a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of manipulating stock prices by buying and selling thinly traded shares between entities he controlled. The criminal charges, filed shortly before Mr. Homm’s arrest last year, are based on the same circumstances. The companies whose shares were traded were based in the United States. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Homm earned commissions as a result of trades between the hedge fund and a Los Angeles broker in which he owned a stake. The trades inflated the prices of penny stocks and made Absolute Capital Management look more valuable than it was, the F.B.I. said in a statement. Mr. Homm and people he worked with are accused of earning $53 million through the scheme. Mr. Homm faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud. The German magazine Stern reported that an Italian doctor, Giuseppe Meco, described as a leading neurologist, testified before the Italian high court in December that, while Mr. Homm is suffering from multiple sclerosis, he is fit enough to withstand incarceration. Mr. Handzlik, Mr. Homm’s lawyer, disagreed, saying in a telephone interview that Mr. Homm would effectively be exposed to life imprisonment in the United States, a much harsher penalty than would be likely on similar charges in Italy. Mr. Handzlik said that Mr. Homm’s lawyers in Italy would also cite humanitarian grounds in arguing for leniency.

Foreign   Show Banned, French Comedian Has New One. Advertisement Advertisement By REUTERSJAN. 12, 2014 PARIS — A French comedian said Saturday that he had dropped a show banned for its anti-Semitic language and was planning one that would cause no objections. On Friday, France’s highest administrative court upheld a ban on a show by the comedian, Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala, in the central city of Tours, days after it was also banned in the western city of Nantes. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala said in a statement that his lawyers would continue to defend the banned show in court, and that his new show, about Africa, would have none of the language that the courts found objectionable. “We live in a democratic country and I have to comply with the laws, despite the blatant political interference,” he said. “As a comedian, I have pushed the debate to the very edge of laughter.” Mr. M’Bala M’Bala, 46, has been repeatedly fined for hate speech, and the local authorities in several towns have banned his shows as a threat to public order. Advertisement Interior Minister Manuel Valls has urged local authorities to take a hard line in determining whether to ban the show. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala had been scheduled to perform in the city of Orleans on Saturday, but the show was canceled by a local court after a request by the mayor. Jacques Verdier, one of Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s lawyers, told the television channel iTele that the new show would not run afoul of the courts. “Let him work now,” he said. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s lawyers have repeatedly said the bans infringed his right to freedom of speech. Critics say the comedian’s trademark downward straight-arm gesture is a Nazi salute in reverse. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala counters that it is meant to be anti-Zionist and anti-establishment, but not anti-Semitic. “I am not a Nazi, I am not anti-Semitic,” he said Saturday. Originally active with left-wing, antiracist groups, Mr. M’Bala M’Bala began openly criticizing Jews and Israel in 2002 and ran in European elections two years later for a pro-Palestinian party. The founder of the French far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has said he is the godfather of one of Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s children, but his daughter Marine Le Pen, who now runs the party, has kept her distance from the comedian. Elie Semoun, a Jewish comedian with whom Mr. M’Bala M’Bala formed a popular comic duo in the mid-1990s, said he did not understand the turn his old friend had taken. “We worked together for 15 years,” Mr. Semoun said in a short act on French television on Saturday. “How did you support me for so long?” Advertisement “When Dieudo and I started out together, we were the very symbol of antiracism, to the point that I forgot that I was black and he was Jewish,” Mr. Semoun said. “Too bad, I loved being black.” A version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2014, on page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Show Banned, French Comedian Has New One.

Travel   52 Places to Go in 2014. Advertisement Advertisement Witness a city in transformation, glimpse exotic animals, explore the past and enjoy that beach before the crowds. UPDATED September 5, 2014 A place to meditate on freedom, and the creative life that followed. When Nelson Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island prison, he found inspiration in Cape Town. “We often looked across Table Bay at the magnificent silhouette of Table Mountain,” he said in a speech. “To us on Robben Island, Table Mountain was a beacon of hope. It represented the mainland to which we knew we would one day return.” Cape Town’s importance to Mandela, who made his first address there as a free man, will doubtless draw many visitors in the wake of his death. The country has transformed itself since Mandela’s imprisonment, but there’s still much to be done. Many in Cape Town have been grappling with that challenge, including its creative class, which has been examining whether inspired design can solve some of the issues stemming from years of inequality. The city formally takes up that issue this year during its turn as World Design Capital. Cape Town is celebrating design in all its forms, putting on fashion shows by students and established designers alike, hosting architecture open houses, welcoming the public into artists’ studios and folding the annual visual arts spectacular Design Indaba conference, which took place in February, into the design capital program. Also part of the lineup are locals seeking to rejuvenate impoverished black-majority townships: The Maboneng Lalela Project turns township homes into galleries and performance spaces; Foodpods constructs sustainable farms, giving residents access to healthy produce; and the Langa Quarter project seeks to make the precinct a cultural tourism destination. Cape Town is again reinventing itself, and the world is invited to its renaissance. Facebook Participate The rebirth of a quake-ravaged city. Three years after two large earthquakes devastated central Christchurch, the city is experiencing a rebirth with creativity and wit — thanks to the ingenuity of its hardy residents — and is welcoming tourists back again. Though much of the central city has yet to be rebuilt, entrepreneurs and volunteers are finding surprising ways to make temporary use of empty lots and bring life back to the downtown. The Gap Filler program, begun a couple of months after the first quake in September 2010 and expanded after a more destructive second quake in February 2011, has created a dance floor with coin-operated music and lights and even a nine-hole mini-golf course in vacant lots across the city. The Greening the Rubble campaign has since the 2010 quake been planting temporary gardens on the sites of demolished buildings. To replace the badly damaged 19th-century ChristChurch Cathedral, a magnificent transitional church by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban opened in 2013 with sturdy cardboard tubes for the roof. Businesses are also trickling back downtown. One bar, built inside shipping containers, has a name that encapsulates the spirit of the entire city: Revival. Facebook Participate A glorious new preserve for the public. One hundred and thirty miles north of San Francisco, the moody bluffs of the Mendocino Coast have long been a spectacular place from which to observe marine life: passing humpback whales, sun-happy sea lions, foamy waves strewn with kelp. The incorporation of the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands — nearly 1,300 acres — gives hikers new access to a contiguous 12-mile stretch of coastline and fields of wildflowers, cypress forests and cliff areas (some overlooking dramatic blowholes, pinnacles and sea caves), much of it previously off-limits to the public. And Congressional proposals to include the north coast lands as part of the California Coastal National Monument have passed, which means better protection and more funds for maintenance; plans also exist to extend the California Coastal Trail through the new preserve. Facebook Participate On a rugged shore, Europe at its best. What if you could combine the rugged beauty you’d find on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast with the ruins of an undiscovered Turkey or Greece, all wrapped in the easygoing nature characteristic of rural Italy — at a fraction of the cost? Turns out you can, on the coast of Albania. The roughly Maryland-size country, between Greece and Montenegro, sits about 45 miles east of Italy on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and has limestone-ringed beaches, ancient ruins like Butrint and waterfront inns where you can stay for less than $50 a night. Rampant development threatened to turn it all to concrete in the years after Communism, but a new government took office in 2013 on promises of keeping the coast authentic. Head to villages like Qeparo, within sight of Corfu, where you can kayak past Cold War submarine tunnels, swim by abandoned forts and watch the tide rise during a dinner of fresh fish at an inn called the Riviera. This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap. Facebook Participate Downtown? Really? Yes, thanks to a thriving food scene. Gone is the musty, lifeless, only-open-for-Kings-hockey-games reputation of downtown Los Angeles. While the museums in this corner of the city are thriving (the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art is nearby), the growing dynamism of downtown is the food scene. Most notable is the Grand Central Market, an arcade of over 30 of the best food vendors in the city. Originally built in 1917, the market has been redone in the past year, attracting popular purveyors like G&B Coffee and, soon, Belcampo Meat Co. Just down the street is Alma, which was named the best new restaurant in the country by Bon Appétit magazine. And where there is good food there is good shopping. Stores have added cachet to the neighborhood; an outlet of the fashion label Acne Studios opened in December, and Aesop, a skin-care specialist, in May. Diners and shoppers alike also have a hip place to stay: An Ace Hotel opened early this year. Facebook Participate Africa’s latest conservation success story is a boon for travelers. Namibia’s communal conservancy movement, which pairs sustainable tourism with rural community outreach, has been a much-heralded success: In 2013, the country’s 79 conservancies received the prestigious Gift to the Earth Award from the World Wildlife Fund, and the stunning Namib Sand Sea Desert joined Unesco’s World Heritage list. Options abound for travelers who want to help the effort, including the Desert Rhino Camp, which Wilderness Safaris runs in partnership with the Save the Rhino Trust; the camp directly supports the conservancy, which has reversed dwindling rhino populations. Wilderness Safaris also plans to open the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp, on the Hoanib River in the north. And Namibia’s Tourism Board introduced three self-drive routes this year to point visitors toward less-visited parts of the country. Facebook Participate Epic biodiversity, and a newly renovated railway to get you there. Ecuador is famed as the home of the Galápagos, the beloved islands off the coast that feature mind-boggling wildlife — but the mainland is no slouch either. One of the most biodiverse countries in the world, Ecuador has over 1,600 species of birds, 4,000 kinds of orchids, one of the largest condor shelters on the planet — and one-fifth of the country (including the Galápagos) is protected. And there is a new way to see a good chunk of it: the recently refurbished Tren Crucero. The luxury vintage train starts in Quito (the first city ever to be declared a World Heritage site by Unesco) and travels through the Andes, over snow-capped mountains, past volcanoes, around a harrowing turn called the Devil’s Nose and through the countryside until arriving in the bustling city of Guayaquil. The four-day trip includes an excursion to Cotopaxi National Park — a place where you might see deer, wolves, bears or one of those condors. Facebook Participate Now open: One of the world’s largest caves. Son Doong Cave in the Quang Binh province of central Vietnam is one of the world’s largest caves and is now, for the first time, accessible to tourists, thanks to the tour operator Oxalis. Huge shafts of light penetrate its vast caverns, allowing forests of 100-foot-tall trees to thrive in spaces big enough to accommodate 40-story skyscrapers. Colossal 260-foot stalactites are also present. Monkeys, hornbills and flying foxes have all been spotted in this surreal habitat, first fully explored in 2009. While trips into Son Doong are limited in number (only 220 permits for the year) and to visitors with deep pockets (over $6,000 per trip), the nearby and more affordable Tu Lan Cave is also now open to adventurous travelers. Facebook Participate For Australian panache, go west. Perth, the capital of western Australia, has long been feted for its beaches, laid-back vibe and Aboriginal heritage, but lately Australia’s fourth-largest city is exhibiting the signs of a trendy transformation. Regional wine lists? Check. Modish new restaurants in repurposed spaces like stables (the Stables Bar), cottages (the Old Crow) or a printing press building (the Print Hall)? Check. International celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver, whose Italian spot Jamie’s Italian recently opened? Up-and-coming neighborhoods like Mount Lawley and Northbridge, chockablock with cafes and vintage shops? Check and check. Transformation is evident on a larger scale, too: The Riverside project is infusing the eastern side of the city with parks, shops and housing plazas, while expansion of the new Crown Perth complex includes hotels — Crown Metropol and Crown Promenade — and posh restaurants like Nobu and La Vie Champagne Lounge. Now that first- and business-class lounges have opened at Los Angeles International Airport this year, the national airline Qantas makes it easy to get Down Under in style. Facebook Participate First-class architecture in the Netherlands’ second city. Post-World War II reconstruction has changed the face of one of Europe’s largest ports, where striking, cubed architecture gives shape to the most modern skyline in the country. But it’s not done yet. This is a banner year for ribbon cuttings to celebrate both new and reconfigured space: An overhaul of Rotterdam Centraal  train station in March has already unveiled a new shop-lined pedestrian passageway and the city’s first Starbucks. The renovated Kunsthal museum reopened in February. François Geurds, chef of the two-Michelin-starred restaurant FG, opened another restaurant in January. Come December, the massive arch of the Markthal, whose interior displays 3-D food photographs, becomes the country’s first indoor food hall. Need a launching pad? Check into a brand-new gem: the Rem Koolhaas-designed nhow hotel. Facebook Participate Urban and outdoor pursuits in one (reasonably) compact package. The traveler who wants to do it all should consider Taiwan. This island, roughly the size of the Netherlands, has an easy-to-navigate public transport network that links a cosmopolitan capital with a bounty of natural and man-made wonders. Taipei, whose robust art scene recently earned its selection as the World Design Capital for 2016, has more places to lay your head: A boutique hotel from the homegrown bookstore chain Eslite will join the recent arrivals Mandarin Oriental, Le Meridien and W. All of these should be a convenient base from which to do some sightseeing on 17 bike trails along the shores of Taipei’s many rivers and inlets or to take a foray into the city’s vibrant street food scene with a nightcap at the reservations-only bespoke bar Alchemy, which opened in 2012 to much acclaim. Four hours south by high-speed rail and bus, 70-square-mile Kenting National Park is home to wetlands, white sands, fishing villages and, starting this year, a ferry point for the deep sea fishing and diving paradise of Orchid Island. Up north in Keelung, a new National Museum of Marine Science and Technology has opened, part of a revitalization project at Badouzi Harbor, which is linked to nearby headlands by color-coded walking routes. And it all becomes cheaper to get to later this year, with the launch of budget carriers from China Airlines and TransAsia Airways. Facebook Participate An infusion of hip night life wakes up a humdrum city. Frankfurt, long considered strictly a financial capital and major travel hub, used to land on the culturati map once a year, during its annual book fair. A recent boom of restaurants and clubs, though, makes the case for permanent placement. Leading the city’s transformation is its fast-evolving red light district, where spots like Maxie Eisen, a deli-style cafe by day and a speakeasy-inspired bar by night, offer a sexiness that isn’t unseemly. In the city center, a buzzy pan-Asian restaurant called Moriki was just opened by the Berlin-based chef Duc Ngo with a menu that includes envelope-pushing courses like sushi pizza; and the new sleek Lamoraga, a modern Spanish restaurant, is pulling in the shopping crowds for lunch. By the end of next year, the developer Ardi Goldman plans to reinvent and reopen the famed King Kamehameha Club, which had its original heyday in the 1990s and 2000s. And growth extends to the art world: The 32,000-square-foot underground extension at the Städel Museum earned accolades from around the globe when it opened last year. Facebook Participate An ambitious art scene heads toward the international stage. Building on a strong historical legacy (Addis boasts one of East Africa’s oldest art schools) are a host of events scheduled for 2014: a photography festival, two film festivals and a jazz and world music festival. Thanks to the city’s diverse art institutions and galleries, including the artist-in-residence village Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the Asni Gallery (really more an art collective than a gallery), there is an art opening at least once a week. Even the local Sheraton puts on “Art of Ethiopia,” an annual show of new talent. But it’s the National Museum that, in May and June, hosted this year’s blockbuster exhibit, “Ras Tafari: The Majesty and the Movement,” devoted to Emperor Haile Selassie I and Rastafarianism. Facebook Participate A world-class World Cup getaway. Now that the World Cup is over, escape to Fernando de Noronha, a 21-island archipelago about 330 miles off the coast of one of the host cities, Recife. Here you’ll find 250-foot-high black cliffs muscling against peach-sand beaches, Portuguese hilltop forts and blue coves where humpbacks and spinner dolphins linger. Only one of the islands, Noronha, is inhabited, and the entire chain is protected as a park with just 246 visitors allowed per day. Regulations have kept Noronha relaxed, with only small hotels and roads rough enough to make dune buggies the rental cars of choice. Hike along cliffs to gorgeous beaches like Sancho, dive with sea turtles or climb Morro do Pico, a 1,059-foot-high volcanic pinnacle. Facebook Participate Leather jackets and skinny jeans join cowboy boots. Country music lovers have long made the pilgrimage to Nashville, but now the city has fast gained cachet among rock fans and foodies. The city’s vibrant scene is home to the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Jeff the Brotherhood and Diarrhea Planet, who all play in town occasionally. And a youthquake is transforming scruffy neighborhoods like 12South and East Nashville into hipster hubs. New hangouts include Pinewood Social, a bar, restaurant, bowling alley and karaoke joint, and the 404, a restaurant and boutique hotel in a former auto garage. Add to that a thriving culinary scene, exemplified by the Music City Eats Festival, back for a second year in September. And Nashville’s old standbys — like the honky-tonk Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and the venerable Ryman — are as fun as ever. Facebook Participate New reasons to play, and watch players, in Scotland’s yards. Riddled with lochs and crested by moody Highlands, Scotland adds to its already considerable outdoorsy appeal this year. In April, the John Muir Way, named for the conservationist originally from Scotland, expanded to 134 miles from 45 miles, newly spanning the farmland and forests of the country’s midsection. Organizers estimate it will take eight to 12 days on foot or four to six by bike to complete the coast-to-coast route running from Muir’s boyhood hometown Dunbar west to the Loch Lomond area. The attractions extend beyond amateur workouts. This summer, Glasgow staged the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Olympic-style competitions for Britain and the former British colonies, and in September Gleneagles resort in the Highlands will host the Ryder Cup golf competition. Sports and hospitality meet at Cromlix House Hotel, a 15-room resort that the tennis champion and local hero Andy Murray opened earlier this year in a Victorian mansion in Dunblane. Facebook Participate An oil boom town gets its cultural legs. Flush with oil money, Calgary has morphed from ho-hum city on the prairie into a cultural hub, with offerings far beyond the Stampede, the annual rodeo and festival. Locals stroll over the tubular Peace Bridge, designed by Santiago Calatrava, opened in 2012. Public art is part of life; in 2013 Jaume Plensa completed Wonderland, a 39-foot-tall steel mesh head installed in front of the new skyline-transforming Norman Foster-designed Bow Tower. They join beloved cultural institutions like the One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theater, whose dancer and choreographer Denise Clarke was in December named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors. Facebook Participate Sand and surf, now a (low-cost) hop from Osaka. The yen is the weakest it’s been against the dollar in years, putting Japan more within reach in 2014. For low prices coupled with laid-back attitudes, look way south to the island of Ishigaki, 250 miles south of Okinawa Island and far from the bustle of Tokyo. The 85-square-mile island, largely undiscovered, is home to sunburned surfers, sandy beaches and beautiful coral reefs. And it’s never been easier to reach: A new airport opened here in March 2013, and Japan’s new low-cost carrier, Peach, just began service from Osaka. Facebook Participate A pristine slice of biodiversity is home to a new luxury eco-resort. Set between Mount Kenya and the Great Rift Valley, the Laikipia Plateau teems with wildlife: elephants, leopards, endangered rhinos and one of the highest concentrations of zebras on the continent. Now the area has also become a conservation success story, sustained and protected through an unusual mix of public and private partnerships and a network of environmentally minded ranchers. With the 2013 opening of Segera, a resort owned by Jochen Zeitz, a German-born executive, there is also a new spot to admire its pristine landscapes. The 50,000-acre property includes an enviable collection of contemporary African art, an organic and solar-powered farm and a wine collection focusing on African labels. And more sustainable travel may be on the horizon: A new national park on the area’s southwestern border has been proposed by the government. Facebook Participate A volcano, a temple, a shrine and now a place to stay. This central Javan sultanate draws crowds for its proximity to bewitching attractions: the monumental, wedding cake-esque Buddhist temple Borobudur, the soft-serve-ice-cream-shaped Hindu shrines of Prambanan, and pre-sunrise hikes to summit Indonesia’s friskiest volcano, Mount Merapi (which most recently erupted in 2013). But finding a decent room has never been easy, until now. Thanks to tax breaks for hotel development, 20 new starred hotels, to complement the city’s existing 30, will open through 2015. Among them are Zest Hotel (a Swiss-Belhotel brand) at the end of 2014 and, according to a director of the Tourism Promotion Agency of Yogyakarta, three new properties from Accor, whose brands include Sofitel and ibis. Facebook Participate A ski area spruces up with new terrain, lodging and an entire base village. For decades Northstar-at-Tahoe, on the north end of Lake Tahoe, was a mostly overlooked ski hill. Since 2004, however, more than $1 billion has poured into the resort. Though weather in the region has been fickle so far this season, the improvements are impressive. And they aren’t limited to the base village that has risen at the renamed Northstar, centered around a huge ice rink ringed by couches and fire pits. The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe opened a few years ago, and Vail Resorts, since buying the ski resort in late 2010, has built an on-mountain day lodge, added more terrain and installed the new Promised Land Express lift on the resort’s Backside. Tahoe is resurgent, as resorts from Squaw Valley to Homewood undertake improvements with an eye toward bidding for the 2026 Winter Olympics. In the next few years expect to see everything from the Cal Neva Resort, once owned by Frank Sinatra, open after a big renovation, to a South Lake Tahoe with new waterfront hotels. Facebook Participate A photogenic (and historic) ale trail. The sprawling northern county of Yorkshire is becoming a big destination for beer lovers, thanks to a recently published guidebook called “Great Yorkshire Beer” and a renewed interest in historic breweries like Samuel Smith (founded in 1758) and Timothy Taylor (from 1858). Spend an evening crawling through the Fat Cat, the Kelham Island Tavern and other award-winning pubs in Sheffield — recently called Britain’s best beer city by the connoisseur Adrian Tierney-Jones — then travel to Leeds, whose compact center is home to the Victoria Hotel, the Cross Keys and other public houses that pull pints on traditional hand pumps. A final stay in the photogenic city of York offers a Tudor-style pub at the end of every cobbled lane, as well as modern beer temples like York Tap, Pivni and the House of Trembling Madness. Facebook Participate Reborn, relentless and still over the top. Five years ago, one of the planet’s most ambitious cities appeared to be dying. Crushed with debt, Dubai found its megaprojects and skyscrapers scuttled or scrapped. The city went from juggernaut to joke. But now, it’s back. Economically surging, Dubai has won its bid to host World Expo 2020 and has unveiled its Tourism Vision, also for 2020, a plan to attract 20 million tourists — double the current crowd. Last October witnessed the first passenger terminal at Dubai World Central Al Maktoum International Airport, and travelers will discover colossal new hotels like the 555-room Conrad Dubai and the 77-story JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, which Guinness World Records recognizes as the tallest hotel in the world. This year, a new tram system will be inaugurated, along with some theme parks, including the first phase of Dubai Adventure Studios, the first phase of IMG Worlds of Adventure, and Holy Quran Park (devoted to the Islamic holy book). Facebook Participate New saints, a new(ish) pope and newly restored treasures beckon. Pope Francis, who has nearly 4.8 million followers on Twitter and routinely makes headlines for doing things like inviting atheists to join the cause for peace in his Christmas message, is widely viewed as reinvigorating the scandal-plagued, conservative-leaning Roman Catholic Church. (Just ask Time magazine, which last December named him the 2013 Person of the Year.) The first South American pope is so popular that the Vatican estimated that nearly a million visitors came in April for Holy Week and the canonization of John XXIII and John Paul II. Services commemorating the new saints will continue throughout the year. The faithful can also enjoy the fruits of restorations that have taken years, like that of Bernini’s colonnade in St. Peter’s Square and the reopening of the Via Triumphalis necropolis, a vast ancient Roman cemetery first uncovered in the 1950s. And pilgrims can stay up-to-date on news and events, including restorations and exhibitions, thanks to the Pope’s new mobile app. Facebook Participate South American beach towns, before they go upscale. Around glamorous Punta del Este and boho-chic José Ignacio, there’s no deficiency of boutique hotels, expat art galleries and exclusive waterfront brasseries. But farther east along the Uruguayan Riviera, a relatively untrodden stretch of Atlantic coast tucked between Argentina and Brazil, sun, sand and simplicity remain the draw — for now. In the Rocha region, villages like Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, San Antonio and Punta del Diablo are just starting to attract serious international attention, bringing a sprinkling of first-rate accommodation — like Brisas, a clifftop 14-room inn restored by an Argentine tech mogul — without compromising the area’s natural charms: miles of undeveloped beach, rolling pastures and a culture where gaucho cowboys and fishermen with wooden boats aren’t just props. Facebook Participate A cultural capital springs to life. Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu (and formerly known as Madras), was long considered the gateway to popular South Indian tourist destinations like Kerala but was overlooked as an attraction itself. It is, however, a national cultural capital and home to several dance and music schools like Kalakshetra for dance and the Music Academy for Carnatic South Indian music, which both regularly hold performances around town. There are also historic sites aplenty, including the Kapaleeswarar Temple, built in the name of the Hindu god Shiva. Fresh buzz makes this city especially enticing: Several major hotels including the Park Hyatt have recently opened, and there is a slew of new and trendy clubs, boutiques and restaurants, including Ottimo for excellent pizzas. Facebook Participate An African luxury hot spot that’s become easier to get to. This archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean now has one of the world’s most expensive hotels. The listed price for a villa at the North Island resort, on a private island where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed during their honeymoon, ranges from 2,582 to 4,079 euros (about $3,670 to $5,800) per night; the Doubletree by Hilton Seychelles, which opened last year is, thankfully, more affordable. The appeal goes beyond pampering and powdery beaches: The Seychelles is also home to some 100,000 giant Aldabra tortoises that live on a coral atoll that is a Unesco World Heritage site. Air Seychelles recently signed code-share agreements with Air Berlin, Cathay Pacific Airways and other airlines, making these islands about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Africa more accessible. Facebook Participate A Phuket-like hideaway, but still unspoiled. The southern Thailand town of Krabi lies just a 45-minute boat ride across the Andaman Sea from Phuket. But you can spare yourself the trip to Phuket — plenty of riches lie here, and you don’t have to fight the crowds to enjoy them. Krabi sits next to the Mu Koh Lanta National Park, a prime spot for hiking, rock climbing and elephant trekking. If you do get restless, there are about 130 pristine islands nearby that are ripe for exploration and virtually undeveloped save for a few ancient monasteries. And Krabi, which used to have few options for accommodations and was hard to get to, is now more tourist-friendly. A number of hotels have opened in recent years, including Phulay Bay, a Ritz-Carlton property. A marina, Port Takola, is in the works and will be home to restaurants, night life and shopping, and a new terminal that has opened at Krabi Airport means that there are more flights to and from this gem. Facebook Participate Ditch those poles. Art and bike trails await. This ski town has a big development off-piste: The long-awaited reinvented Aspen Art Museum opened its doors this summer. The 33,000-square-foot space, designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, is meant to reflect the mountain experience. Visitors first take a lift to the roof and take in the view from the sculpture garden before descending to tour the galleries. There is also plenty of news for outdoor types this year, too, with new mountain biking trails planned throughout Aspen and Snowmass, a new mountain skills center and expanded lift-serviced biking. Facebook Participate Natural wonders are in danger. Go see them before it’s too late. The Icelandic government has spent decades protecting its glaciers, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and permafrost mounds in the Thjorsarver Wetlands, part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of the entire country, mostly in the interior. But last year, the government announced plans to revoke those protections, allowing for the construction of hydropower plants (instead of glaciers and free-flowing rivers, imagine man-made reservoirs, dams, paved roads and power lines). “If they get into this area, there will be no way to stop them from destroying the wetlands completely,” said Arni Finnsson, the chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. If you ever want to see Iceland in all of its famously raw natural beauty, go now. Facebook Participate Soundscapes and culture shine in northern Sweden. A hotbed of hardcore and heavy metal music through the 1990s, this northern city has welcomed all genres during its tenure as a European Capital of Culture this year. Music has taken center stage at outdoor opera performances, a crowdsourced music festival and an orchestral tribute to the local hardcore band Refused. Visual arts focused on the culture of indigenous Sami people are on exhibit at Bildmuseet, the city’s contemporary arts museum that reopened in 2012 in a glass-and-wood building designed by Henning Larsen Architects. And it’s all easier to reach thanks to a new higher-speed rail connection from Stockholm. Facebook Participate Skip smog-choked cities — and face masks — and head out to China’s wild frontier. With pollution skyrocketing in China’s showcase cities, visitors to the country are increasingly seeking out greener pastures to explore. Set deep in the tropics of southern Yunnan province, Xishuangbanna is about as lush as you can get — the region boasts the richest biodiversity in China, including some of the country’s last wild elephants. In February 2013, the area went upscale with its first five-star hotel — the Anantara Xishuangbanna Resort & Spa, which organizes tea-leaf picking trips in mountainside plantations. More action-oriented experiences are possible, as well, such as the tour group WildChina’s jungle biking trips or treks along the caravan route plied by tea traders centuries ago. Facebook Participate A mountain makeover from overlooked to opulent. Andermatt has long been a quiet town of Alpine farmers and bargain-seeking skiers. But the former Swiss Army outpost began its transformation into a bona fide ski destination with the opening last December of the Chedi Andermatt. The 104-room resort, housed in a modernized chalet with a Japanese restaurant among several dining options, indoor and outdoor pools and a 10-treatment-room spa, is just the first phase of a big new development of apartment buildings, homes, five more hotels and a golf course in the coming years over 321 acres. The pedestrian village will offer skiers access by gondola to the nearly 9,800-foot Gemsstock Mountain, with future lifts to the larger nearby ski area of Sedrun planned to open in 2015. Facebook Participate In the land of cars, cycling (and culture) get the limelight. An urban cycling model has arrived in Indianapolis: the new $63 million, eight-mile bike-friendly Indy Cultural Trail. The path connects five downtown neighborhoods, including arty Fountain Square, to top downtown sites, including the Capitol Building, City Market and White River State Park, a 250-acre park that hosts the Indianapolis Zoo and six more major attractions. Bicycles can be rented along the paved and lighted pathway, allowing riders to cruise past public art, including a motion-activated fireflylike swarm of LED lights. City officials say that planners from Cologne, Germany, to Portland, Ore., have come to see how the city most famous for a 500-mile car race managed to swap auto for bike lanes and still keep everything rolling smoothly. Facebook Participate River cruising swells on the Danube of Asia. Like the Danube in Europe, the Mekong River in Southeast Asia has become a vital river cruising course, with a variety of small-ship itineraries linking Vietnam and Cambodia. Late last year, Pandaw River Expeditions upgraded two of its ships, the Mekong Pandaw and Tonle Pandaw, enlarging public spaces, adding gyms and stocking cabins with iPads. In 2012, the company launched the 32-guest Angkor Pandaw, offering three- to seven-night itineraries, while Avalon Waterways set the 32-passenger Avalon Angkor sailing between Ho Chi Minh City and Siem Reap over seven nights. In September, Aqua Expeditions will introduce the 20-suite Aqua Mekong, offering guide-led shore excursions to temples, villages and wildlife-rich areas via skiffs. Facebook Participate Out of an economic crisis, a city surges back. Vibrancy and innovation can bloom even in hard times. Exhibit A is Greece’s ancient capital, which was hit hard by the global economic crisis and yet is seeing change at sites old and new. First the old: At the Acropolis, the famous Caryatids statues continue to get a restoration in 2014. And the new: The National Museum of Contemporary Art will soon open in a former brewery complex. Neighborhoods have also seen a resurgence, including the quickly gentrifying Monastiraki and the still gritty Kerameikos-Metaxourgeio; the latter will get a cultural lift in 2015 from the biannual ReMap art event. Travelers will have a new lodging option by the end of the year, when a revived Emporikon Hotel opens on Aiolou, a street that is also home to a host of new dining spots. Facebook Participate A scenic, low-key destination on the verge of discovery. Most vacationers to La Republica hole up in the all-inclusives north and east, overlooking the rarely traveled southwest. The port town of Barahona is the gateway to the cactus-strewn region’s riches, like the hauntingly beautiful Bahia de las Aguilas beach and the eight climate zones at the geological depression Hoyo de Pelempito, both blissfully devoid of people. But there are signs of the government’s vision to develop the area. The abandoned former Barcelo Bahoruco Beach Resort will partly open at the end of 2014, and two separate 300-room projects — near La Canoa and San Rafael Beach — are in the final stages of design approval. For now, you can experience the quiet life at the thatch-roofed Casa Bonita, or at Rancho Platon, which has a tree house raised between the palms. Facebook Participate Chasing the northern lights? This might be the year. There aren't many reasons to visit the frigid region surrounding the North Pole, but the darkest months, from September through March, offer the most stunning of them: northern lights, that colorful spectacle of solar particles entering our atmosphere. And there are some comfortable ways to see them, thanks to hotels offering northern lights safaris, including the newly opened Ion Luxury Adventure Hotel in Iceland and the Icehotel in Swedish Lapland (and actually within the Arctic Circle). Facebook Participate On the African coast, music thrives in a commercial capital. Tanzania may be best known for the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro and the game-packed plains of the Serengeti, but the real pulse of the country is found in its largest city, Dar es Salaam. An eclectic mix of music echoes through the beach clubs, open-air bars and nightclubs of this Indian Ocean coastal city. Old-school dance music competes with Swahili hip-hop and traditional drumming, all drawing from the city’s African, Indian and Arab influences. Add in the street food, the beaches and the fact that the year-old African low-cost carrier Fastjet uses Dar as its hub, and it’s easy to see that this commercial capital is more than a stopover on the way to Tanzania’s natural splendor. It is an African metropolis coming into its own. Facebook Participate A revitalized city center welcomes new museums and streetcars. Atlanta plans several ribbon cuttings in 2014, but the main event is the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, opened in June next to the Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia Aquarium downtown. The 42,000-square-foot, environmentally friendly museum features permanent galleries devoted to domestic and international rights struggles and houses the Martin Luther King Jr. papers owned by Morehouse College. By November, visitors will be able to take the new Atlanta Streetcar on a 2.7-mile loop that will link the park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and other stops. Another parkside attraction, the 94,000-square-foot College Football Hall of Fame, is opening in time for fall kickoff of the N.C.A.A. season. Facebook Participate Skiing, soba and snow monkeys. For nearly a century, visitors have been lured to this ski destination, a 90-minute drive from Nagano, by affordability and a host of charms: fine powder, long slopes and charming cobblestone lanes lined with traditional ryokan inns, generations-old soba noodle shops and natural hot spring baths. But the recent arrival of stylish, foreigner-friendly restaurants, cafes and bars have infused the area with new energy, offering travelers just the right mix of old and new. Microbrews and excellent coffee are served at ski-in/ski-out Craft Room, while Tamon prepares innovative kaiseki cuisine using local ingredients. The lantern-hung rooms at Jon Nobi are popular among international skiers, as is its chic izakaya restaurant Himatsuri, inspired by the town’s fire festival, held annually on Jan. 15. The Asian operator Backyard Travel offers 10-day itineraries to explore Nozawa and nearby sights like a seventh-century temple and a refuge for the area’s famed snow monkeys. Facebook Participate Serbian wine? Time to take a sip. The Balkan Peninsula has a wine culture that dates back hundreds of years, but war and political unrest over the last century decimated Serbian vineyards. As recently as a decade ago, Serbia produced virtually no wine that met international standards. But progress has been swift. Recently, small producers have revived the Subotica-Horgos wine region near the northern border with Hungary. Here, the Palic Wine Route has been attracting domestic wine tourists who spend days sampling local cabernet sauvignon in wine cellars, sipping dry Trijumf white during dinner at Bosscaffe and unwinding in the Hotel Galleria‘s high-tech spa. Facebook Participate A museum’s entrance makes for something new in the state of Denmark. Even angst-ridden Prince Hamlet, literature’s most famous Dane, might be cheered by the new Maritime Museum of Denmark, which recently opened in his hometown Elsinore. Designed by the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, the glassy structure is built into a U-shaped dry dock and filled with slanted floors and zigzag passageways that evoke ocean-rocked ships’ decks. Maritime relics — from torpedoes to Lego pirate ships — mix with electronic maps and films that explore the romance of the sea, shipboard existence and trade, both centuries ago and today. Interactive exhibits allow you to run your own trade company, navigate by the stars and ink a sailor’s tattoo. For additional watery wonders, head to Copenhagen’s new Blue Planet aquarium, billed as the largest in Northern Europe. Facebook Participate Haute cuisine comes to the lush landscapes of the Lake District. The British dining scene is expanding beyond London, and the chef Simon Rogan deserves much of the credit, having helped elevate the Lake District village of Cartmel into one of England’s most unlikely culinary destinations. His three restaurants in the medieval village — the Michelin two-starred L’Enclume, Rogan & Company and his most recent addition, the Pig & Whistle — have menus featuring whatever’s fresh on his nearby farm. Cartmel is also home to a celebrated farmers’ market, Cartmel Cheeses and the Cartmel Village shop, renowned for its sticky toffee pudding. What’s more, the village is a cozy base from which to explore the Lake District, once an inspiration to William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter. Facebook Participate New peaks open up for alpine adventurers. This Himalayan republic is the mother lode of alpinism, home to eight of the world’s 10 highest summits (including Everest). So when a Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation subcommittee recommended last September that Nepal allow access to 165 new peaks in the Kanchenjunga massif this year — 13 of them above 23,000 feet — the world’s mountaineering community was aflutter. Some welcomed the announcement, while others dismissed it, saying the government had stretched the meaning of “peak” in a few cases to include subpeaks within mountains that were already accessible in order to rake in more in fees. Even so, the proposal was significant since it was the first such release in a decade. And though the government scaled back the scope of the original proposal, it did formally open 104 of the new peaks in May. Facebook Participate Feel like reminiscing? A city is awash in anniversaries. Vienna is home to some 450 balls each year, from traditional waltzes to the “seriously outlandish” Rosenball for the gay community, and this year is the 200th anniversary since the city’s ball culture took root. You could mark the occasion by attending one, but it wouldn’t be the only date to celebrate in the capital city this year. Visitors can pay homage at the Sigmund Freud Museum since it has been 75 years since the psychoanalyst’s death. The city is also commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War I with special exhibits and the European Peace Walk, a permanent route from Vienna to Trieste through five countries. There are also new art spaces, a new transportation hub, more direct flights from the United States and offbeat places to stay, like Urbanauts’ former storefronts or Chez Cliché’s themed apartments, with décor inspired by fictional hosts, such as Marie Therese, who loves Baroque furnishings and classical music. Facebook Participate Even a 1,200-year-old lost city has some new draws. If you’ve seen the temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, then the country’s lost city of Mahendraparvata, its majestic temples on Phnom Kulen and the stone animal carvings at the site of Srah Damrei (elephant pond) should be next on your list. About 30 miles from Siem Reap, Mahendraparvata predates Angkor Wat by about 350 years and was the birthplace of the Khmer Empire in A.D. 802. Although the city has been known about for several decades, researchers in 2013 discovered new temples and a network of roads and dikes that had been concealed under thick mountain vegetation. Facebook Participate Croatia’s architectural and musical gem lies inland. Forget Croatia’s beloved coast: The inland city Varazdin is one of the country’s most picturesque and well-preserved areas. One hour north of Zagreb, this small metropolis of 50,000 has an immaculate cobblestoned town center and is stocked with Baroque churches and palaces like the Draskovic. The theme continues with an annual Baroque music festival, but that’s where it ends. Other music-themed festivals and concerts are decidedly modern and change from year to year: One, the Radar Festival, for contemporary stars, has drawn names such as Bob Dylan and Carlos Santana, and various other festivals throughout the year such as Spancir Fest, celebrated from the end of August to September, attract artists and musicians from around Europe. Facebook Participate Reinventing a Florida city’s reputation. Once mocked for its thousands of green benches dotted with senior citizens, St. Petersburg is anything but stationary. With a redeveloped waterfront, a stunning Dali Museum, and sophisticated restaurants in place, the downtown energy is now heading up historic Central Avenue, thanks in part to the craft beer scene. Among the many recent arrivals, artsy Cycle Brewing features Fixie and Endo ales, while Green Bench Brewing Co., the name a nod to those erstwhile icons, invites winter escapees to its sunny taproom and beer garden. Refuel at the ambitious Rococo Steak, set in a renovated 1920s YWCA, then hit the Tap Room of the reinvented Hollander Hotel. Facebook Participate More flights and lodges in Central America’s eco-frontier. Twenty years ago, when Francis Ford Coppola opened Blancaneaux Lodge in western Belize, relatively few travelers had ventured into this small Central American country. Slowly they arrived, many of them curious to witness the scenery that had captivated the film director, which he described in an email as “completely remote, with a beautiful pristine river you could drink the water out of and the most star-studded night sky I had ever seen.” Since then, upscale rustic hotels have cropped up all over Belize — there’s El Secreto in Ambergris Caye, for example, and Belcampo, an eco-lodge and sustainable farm in the south that’s about to unveil a sophisticated redesign — adding to the lure of rain forests, Mayan ruins and coral reefs. It helps that Belize is easier to reach: Delta recently began nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Belize City, and regional carriers like Tropic Air have expanded their routes, connecting Belize to resorts like Cancún and making remote towns like San Ignacio more accessible. Facebook Participate What you’d expect (natural beauty) and not (world-class museum). This semisecret gem of the South Pacific, a three-hour flight from Sydney, is attracting visitors like never before. Thank infrastructural upgrades like a refurbished international airport, improved roads and bridges, and the arrival of high-profile properties like the new Hilton Noumea La Promenade Residences and the Sheraton New Caledonia Deva Resort & Spa. An island itinerary reads like a fantasy novel: snorkeling and diving in one of the world’s largest lagoons, an aquamarine stunner populated by thousands of coral and marine species and home to the world’s second largest reef (after the Great Barrier); horseback riding through verdant mountains and indigenous Kanak villages; kayaking by moonlight among the submerged forest of the Blue River Provincial Park. The cosmopolitan capital, Nouméa, has its own allures, like Le Roof, where you might spot dolphins diving in the distance while savoring the fresh oysters, and the Tjibaou Cultural Center, a Renzo Piano-designed museum housing one of the world’s largest collections of Pacific art. Facebook Participate Once a kitsch capital, now earning a reputation for food and sports. Known for its remarkable natural beauty and tourist kitsch, Niagara Falls is now evolving into a draw for those who love food as well as those who seek thrills. The Niagara Falls Culinary Institute opened a high-end restaurant, deli, patisserie and gelateria steps from the American Falls, transforming the area’s dining scene overnight. A gastro pub called the Griffon Pub, which features 50 beers on tap and creative New American dishes like gnocchi poutine, opened a few miles east of the falls last year. On the Canadian side, oenophiles can get a taste of the region’s growing wine scene just a short bike ride from the falls along the Niagara River Recreation Trail. Nondining attractions are plentiful, too. This year, Canadians have hosted two major War of 1812 bicentennial re-enactments in the area, and since May visitors have been able to see the falls from a new luxury catamaran. Tourism officials on the Canadian side appear poised to allow daredevils to zip line across or rappel down the Niagara Gorge later this year.

Business   Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War. Advertisement It’s war. You size up your warriors — all three of them. There’s strongest A, next-strongest B, and weakest C. Your opponent has three different-strength warriors as well. Warriors will fight in pairs (each warrior fights just one fight), and whichever side wins the most contests is the victor. You know your opponent will present her warriors in descending order by strength, and you’re initially tempted to do the same, matching your strongest warrior with her strongest warrior, the next-strongest with next-strongest, and so on. But is there a better way? Our puzzle this week is by the award-winning mathematics writer Dana Mackenzie. It’s about gaining advantage in what appears to be a fair game, and its elegant simplicity hides a tough mathematical core that took him and colleague Howard Stern 30 years to crack (Dana Mackenzie tells the remarkable story in the bottom section of this post). We’ll simulate the affair with a deck of numbered cards. It’s — Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War The game requires three people, one of whom serves only as the dealer. The dealer has a deck of six cards numbered one through six. She shuffles the cards and then deals three cards to each player, making sure, as she deals the cards, to place them in order from highest to lowest (she can look at the cards as she’s dealing them without the players seeing their values). Cards are then put face-down into the middle of the table. Player 1 plays a card, without turning it over; then player 2 plays a card, without turning it over. Play continues in the same way until all the cards have been paired up. Only then do the players turn over all the cards, revealing who has won each battle (highest card in each pair wins). In what order should you play your cards? Bonus: How should you play your cards if you’re each dealt four cards? Seven? Super-Bonus (The one that takes 30 years to figure out): How should you play if you’re dealt N cards? Give it a try with Numberplay Inventor-in-Residence Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War gizmo. The story of Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War as told by Dana Mackenzie The saga of One-Round War begins with a college friend of mine named Howard Stern, who went on to graduate school at M.I.T. In 1980, his first year there, he came up with a related question: Suppose two backgammon teams are going to play a match. The top players on each team are supposed to play against each other, the No. 2 player against the No. 2 player, and so forth. Assuming Team A ranks their players honestly, can Team B strategically put their players in a different order and thereby increase their chances of winning? Howard deserves an enormous amount of credit for three things. First, he set up the problem in a way that could be solved. The problem as stated above is too vague and general to have a definitive solution, but he found a more precise version that does. Second, he found a proof-of-concept that Team B can win more than half their games on average. Third, even when he got stuck, Howard never gave up. For 30 years, every time he met a mathematician or computer scientist who might know the answer, he told them about the problem. Finally, in 2012 he saw an article in our college alumni magazine about me, and e-mailed to ask if I might have any clue. I used to be a research mathematician, but by then I had been a writer for more than 15 years. For most of that time I had barely missed doing math; What I remembered most was the endless frustration of working on problems that wouldn’t budge. But Howard’s problem was different. It quickly sucked me in, and became as much of an obsession for me as it had been for him. Over the following year, I spent at least a hundred hours working on it, devised a three-stage strategy and eventually obtained a satisfying and unambiguous solution. I can’t say that there was one great moment of insight that did it. It was more of a kitchen sink strategy: Throw everything I know at the problem, try every little trick I can think of, and see what works. Most of the things I tried didn’t work, but enough things did to keep me going. The very last phase was to come up with a better way of posing the problem. Gary Antonick felt, and I agree, that Howard’s backgammon version requires too much explanation before you get to the heart of the problem. I am indebted to Gary for forcing me to distill the problem down to its essentials. We eventually settled on a card game as the clearest way to explain it. Gary had a hand in codifying what eventually turned out to be a very simple set of rules, and in this way One-Round War was born. And a special note to math lovers everywhere: Dana Mackenzie’s “The Universe in Zero Words: The Story of Mathematics as Told through Equations,” which Nature calls “a celebration of the succinct and the singular in human expression,” is now available in paperback.

Solution and Commentary to Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War The key to victory in this problem is capitalizing on your opponent’s fixed strategy: she will always lead with her strongest cards, so play your weakest cards against those. Let her win and waste her firepower. After the initial dust has cleared you’ll have the advantage, on average, because you’ll still have your strongest cards, while she’s stuck with weaklings.  But how exactly do you play your weak cards? It depends on your goal. To maximize your chances of winning the overall game, or more than half the contests, your should sacrifice up to half your cards: 1 card in the 3-trick game, 2 cards in the 4-trick game, and 3 cards in the 7-trick game. The strategy for N cards depends on whether N is odd or even, as detailed in the full explanation by Dana Mackenzie below. But if your goal is to beat your opponent as badly as possible (on average), you’d want to sacrifice fewer cards in order to potentially win more tricks, even though this aggressive strategy would reduce your overall chance of winning. You’d sacrifice your worst card in the 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-trick games, and only lead with your worst 2 cards once you got to 7 tricks. The strategy becomes more complicated with N cards. Here’s Dana Mackenzie with the complete recap: I was fascinated by the discussion of this week’s problem, and it went in a completely different direction from what I had anticipated! First, early in the week Joe Fendel pointed out that there are two possible objective functions to maximize. Gary Antonick and I had (intentionally) not made it clear which one we wanted. Goal (1) would be to maximize the expected number of tricks taken, and goal (2) would be to maximize the expected number of games won. As I mentioned in an early response (under the pseudonym “Word Lover”), goal (1) is the one that Howard and I took 30 years to solve. Goal (2) seems more logical because, after all, for most games the margin of victory doesn’t matter; it’s all about winning or losing. However, I don’t think that either Howard or I seriously thought about goal (2) because it looked harder. As I explained in my comment, the beauty of goal (1) is that it’s linear. The expected number of tricks won can be obtained just by adding the expected win probability for each card. By contrast, goal (2) is nonlinear. So looking at the problem through the glasses of a mathematician, it seemed as if we should try that problem first. And I’m not the only one who reached that conclusion! In the earliest reference I could find to Howard’s problem, a 1980 paper called “Scheduling Players in Team Competitions” by Arjang Assad et. al., they wrote, “There are, as yet, no efficient solution techniques for problems of this class…” Instead they looked at three “surrogates” for goal (2), one of which is goal (1). Fortunately, Bill from Long Beach, didn’t know any of this and just went ahead and solved goal (2)! It’s a very common sense solution, and his proof looks airtight to me. He says that if the number of cards per hand (N) is odd (i.e., N = 2m – 1), then you should simply play your best m cards against the opponent’s worst m, in order. It’s easily seen that if there is any way for you to take m tricks, then this way will do it. So this is an optimal strategy. That leaves the question of finding the best strategy for goal (2) if there is an even number of cards per hand, i.e., N = 2m. Jeff Mallett has presented pretty compelling computer evidence that in this case you want to sacrifice (m-1) tricks, playing your best (m+1) cards against the opponent’s worst in order. As I write this on Sunday, no one has yet given a mathematical proof, but I feel certain that it’s true. I am so glad that I didn’t specify which goal I was interested in, because if I had specified goal (1), perhaps this whole interesting discussion about goal (2) would not have happened! Now, what about goal (1)? Here there was also significant progress made, as much as I could expect in a week. B. Rubin suggested the idea of forming a matrix or array containing the probability of our i-th card beating the opponent’s j-th card. D-Ferg actually gave a formula for these probabilities. These matrices are key to Howard’s approach to the problem, so let’s look at a few of them: I have tinkered with B. Rubin and D-Ferg’s definitions slightly. First, I’ve multiplied by 2N-choose-N (the common denominator of the probabilities) to get integer matrices. Second, I’ve rearranged the rows so that the entry in row i and column j is the number of hands in which my i-th worst card beats the opponent’s j-th worst card. That’s the way Howard chose to do it, and for better or for worse I’ve stuck with his notation. Now we can state goal (2) succinctly: How can we choose one element from each row and column in a way that maximizes the sum of the elements? For example, in the case N = 4 the optimal choice is 55 + 53 + 55 + 1. This type of problem is called a linear assignment problem by computer scientists. However, the theory does not give us much of a clue about the answer. Computer scientists have found rapid algorithms to solve such problems, but a solution algorithm is not the same as a solution! All the magic of the problem is contained in Howard’s matrices, and believe me, they are truly magical. I wish I had room to tell you all of their cool properties, but let me point out a few simple ones. First, they are symmetric under reflection about the southwest-northeast diagonal. (I call this the “anti-main diagonal”.) Also, pairs of numbers that are symmetric about the southeast-northwest diagonal (the “main diagonal”) always add to the same number. Not only that, Howard observed and proved a remarkable fact. Take any 2-by-2 square in one of these matrices. Add the northeast and southwest entries and subtract the northwest and southeast entries. If your 2-by-2 square lay above the main diagonal, the result is positive; if it straddled the main diagonal, the result is zero; and if it lay below the main diagonal, the result is negative. Using these facts and not much else, Howard showed that the optimal strategy always consists of sacrificing some tricks, with your sacrificed cards in reverse order of strength, and “playing to win” the rest of the tricks, with your cards ordered from stronger to weaker. For example, in the N = 7 case, an allowable solution would be G-F-A-B-C-D-E (which is in fact the correct strategy, as noted by D-Ferg). Another allowable solution would be G-A-D-B-C-E-F. Howard’s result greatly decreases the number of possible solutions, from N-factorial to 2N-3. Howard also made the same conjecture that D-Ferg came up with: in the optimal solution, you should play your k worst cards against the opponent’s k best cards, for some k. However, Howard couldn’t prove his conjecture, and had no idea what the correct value of k might be. The problem lay fallow for 30 years. To confirm Howard’s conjecture, and compute k, I had to dig a lot deeper into Howard’s matrices. First, I showed that the optimal solution must be symmetric about the anti-main diagonal. This was the first key step, and I was shocked when I succeeded. It frequently happens in mathematics that a symmetric objective function has a maximum with the same symmetry, but you can’t count on it. In fact, if it were always true, we wouldn’t live in the universe we know today, because the Higgs boson is a result of an optimization problem with a broken symmetry. When combined with Howard’s result, this showed that the sacrificed games in fact lie on the anti-main diagonal. In other words, if we decide to sacrifice our i-th worst card, we should always play it against the opponent’s i-th best card. This rules out G-A-D-B-C-E-F, because if we decide to sacrifice card D it should be placed in the fourth position, not the third. However, G-A-E-B-C-D-F is still a possible solution. Our third-worst card (E) is sacrificed to our opponent’s third-best card. The next step was to show there are no “gaps.” This was the conjecture that D-Ferg made and Howard before him. The idea of this part of the proof was quite subtle, and in fact I could only complete it after doing the last part—finding the optimal number of games to sacrifice. In essence, I had to show that a permutation with gaps would fall short of the best gap-free permutation, which I could compute exactly. It requires some delicate estimates, and I have only succeeded in showing the “no-gaps” principle for N greater than 10 million. I suspect that the same argument will work, albeit with more effort, for N greater than 400. Howard has confirmed the “no-gaps” principle for N less than 60. I would greatly appreciate it if somebody with a supercomputer could bridge the gap, and show the no-gaps principle holds for N between 60 and 400. After all this grubby work, the best part of the problem is the last step—finding the optimal number of tricks to sacrifice. D-Ferg tabulated these numbers in one of his posts, and the pattern looks mysterious indeed. But here is the secret (up to one nuisance detail that I’ll get to in a second). To figure out the number of games to sacrifice, add the numbers in the 2N-th row of Pascal’s triangle. When the sum becomes greater than the center entry, stop. If you have added r numbers, then the correct number of tricks to sacrifice is N + 1 – r. Let’s check it for N = 7. Looking at the 14-th row of Pascal’s triangle, we compute 1 + 14 + 91 + 364 + 1001 + 2002 = 3471 > 3432 (the center entry of the 14-th row). Because we had to add six entries, the number of games to sacrifice is 7 + 1 – 6 = 2. The nuisance detail? This procedure would give the correct answer if we literally forfeited the tricks that we intended to sacrifice. However, in the real game of Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War, we might occasionally win a trick we had intended to lose. As Jeff Mallett observed (though not quite in this context), when we are playing the optimal strategy, the expected number of tricks that we will win by accident, especially when N is large, is much less than 1. Thus, in some cases, the method I have just told you may sometimes underestimate the correct number by 1, but it will never underestimate by more. For obsessive-compulsive types, there is a formula that takes into account the “accidental” tricks. However, it’s slightly less elegant than the method I have just described, so I won’t give it here. If you’d like to read a more literary version of the puzzle and its solution, please check out A Formula That Shows How to Cheat & Triumph at Tournaments, which I recently wrote for Nautilus. Finally, let me point out that a couple of readers mentioned earlier occurrences of this problem. Lee from London wrote that the N = 3 version was in effect solved more than 2300 years ago by a legendary Chinese military strategist named Sun Bin! So perhaps we should call it “Sun Bin’s One-Round War.” Thanks so much to all of you who wrote in, and I hope some of you will be motivated to continue thinking about variations on the problem. What about multiple-player versions? What about Howard’s original version, which involved a backgammon match? In Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War, card 8 beats card 7 every time. But in an actual sporting competition, such as backgammon, the higher-rated player will not win with 100 percent certainty. It would be interesting to devise a more realistic model of the advantage of one player over another, and see how robust our results are.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 14. Advertisement   PARIS— text starts hereFor some time, the shopkeepers of the Ternes quarter have been receiving a number of counterfeit ten franc pieces. On Saturday a woman named Wetche was arrested for attempting to pass one of these pieces, which all bear the head of Napoleon III and the date 1864. At her home in Boulogne-sur-Seine, the police found hidden in an attic over the little watch and clock repairing shop kept by her husband, a complete counterfeiting outfit and a large number of the false coins. The whole family are now under arrest. 1939: Colonel Raynal, Hero of Verdun Dies at 72 PARIS — text starts here Colonel Sylvain Raynal, hero of the defense of Verdun in 1916, who held out in Port de Vaux against overwhelming German forces for a week, only to be forced to surrender, died yesterday at Boulogne of a heart attack. He was seventy-two. He had retired from the army in 1926 to his farm at Maraval, in Périgord. He was an honorary member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, an American veterans’ organization. Astounded by Colonel Raynal’s feat of staving off their advance with but a handful of poilus, the Germans in 1916 treated their captive as a hero, and the Crown Prince himself accepted his sword of surrender. At a prison in Mainz, he was given special status.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Science   Mediterranean Diet for Diabetes Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement More good news on the Mediterranean diet. Sticking to a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes, even when people don’t lose weight or increase exercise levels. The Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil, nuts, fish, beans, fruits and vegetables, with few dairy products and moderate alcohol consumption. The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, randomly assigned 3,541 men and women, ages 55 to 80 and free of diabetes, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either two ounces of extra-virgin olive oil, one supplemented with an ounce of mixed nuts a day, and a control group advised to eat a low-fat diet. They followed the participants for an average of about four years, with no intervention to increase physical activity or limit calories. Compared with the control group, and after adjusting for health and socioeconomic factors, the risk for diabetes was 40 percent lower with the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil and 18 percent lower with the diet supplemented with nuts. “The strength of our study is that it has a large number of participants with a long follow-up and a randomized design,” said an author, Dr. Ramón Estruch, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Barcelona. “The diet works by itself without considering physical activity or changes in weight, which were insignificant between groups.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/14/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nutrition: Mediterranean Diet for Diabetes.

Sports   Speed of Courts a Hot Topic at Australian Open. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN ROTHENBERGJAN. 12, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — With the first Grand Slam of the year quickly approaching, one of the hottest topics among players has been just how quick play will be at the Australian Open. The top seed Rafael Nadal, a player at his most comfortable on slow clay, said he believed the blue hardcourts at Melbourne Park were considerably speedier than they have been in the past. “Completely different conditions than what I remembered of this tournament, faster conditions that I ever played here in Australia,” Nadal said, his tone indicating displeasure with the perceived change. Nadal, who played a marathon five-hour 53-minute match here against Novak Djokovic in 2012 in the longest Grand Slam final of all time, expressed confusion over why the Open would want to change the conditions that he believes produce the most epic and enjoyable matches. “I really don’t understand very well why they change because the last couple of years, Australian Open had amazing matching, long ones, good ones for the crowd,” he said Saturday. “I don’t know why the people who decide to make the conditions that fast. I am not sure for the show is the best thing. But they decide, and I’m just a player to try to be competitive from the beginning.” Advertisement Most players disagreed with Nadal’s perception of a major shift. Djokovic, the defending men’s champion, said Sunday there was “not any major difference, anything significant that I would notice” from last year to this one. Andy Murray, a three-time finalist, echoed that sentiment a day earlier, saying conditions were “exactly the same.” The tournament director Craig Tiley told The Melbourne Age, however, that no changes have been made to the Plexicushion surface from last year, though Wilson changed its tennis balls last year to ones with a more tightly woven felt, which could allow for quicker play. Speculation that the play might be much faster here first came up during a warm-up event two weeks ago in Brisbane. The courts there are meant to mirror the conditions in Melbourne, and they played far more quickly than they had in years past. Court conditions were also quicker and slicker at the tournament last week in Sydney, allowing the grass court specialist Tsvetana Pironkova to have her best-ever week on hardcourts. She beat three top-10 players en route to her first career WTA title. When word first reached Nadal that conditions in Australia were believed to be quicker, he responded with mock indignation. I thought Craig Tiley was a good friend,” he deadpanned. Maria Sharapova, who reached the semifinals in Brisbane, said that she played there on “one of the fastest courts we’ve played on in a really long time,” but that courts in Melbourne were “a bit slower.” “I’m not sure why there’s not more consistency in terms of all the events having the same speed,” said Sharapova, the No. 2 seed at the Open, which begins Monday. “I guess it is what it is.” While playing in the faster conditions of Brisbane, Roger Federer bemoaned that no matter how the balls were changed, the gritty courts in Melbourne would fluff up the felt on the balls. Advertisement “You can speed up the balls as much as you want, they’re going to be so fuzzed up after two games that it’s just going to be hard to hit winners and service winners,” he said. “If that’s what people want to see, just rallies, rallies, rallies all the time, then it’s good to have a slow court. If you want a bit more even ground for everybody, even the lower-ranked guys and more danger for the top guys, you go with a faster court. Maybe we’ll get more serve-and-volley back into the game or more of the unknown, which I think is nice.” Federer, the No. 6 seed at the Open, also pointed out that conditions in the late rounds in Melbourne were altered by having the semifinal and final rounds played at night, which he said had “slowed down conditions drastically over time.” The semifinals first moved to night sessions in 2000, and the first men’s night final was in 2005. “I think it’s quite incredible how things have slowed down over the years,“ Federer said of the tour in general. “I remember when I came up on tour with Lleyton things were so different,” he said, referring to Lleyton Hewitt, who turned pro in 1998, the same year as Federer. “We had to change our games around to be able to still compete today.” Murray offered a different critique of the newly renovated Margaret Court Arena besides the speed of the surface. Having practiced on it earlier that day, Murray determined that the court was “on a very big slope.” “The court is like that,” he said, tilting his arm to indicate alpine conditions. “It’s weird.” A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Business   Tepid U.S. Sales Are a Drag on Volkswagen’s Ambitions. Advertisement Advertisement By JACLYN TROPJAN. 13, 2014 DETROIT — Volkswagen has outlined ambitious plans to become the world’s top-selling automaker within the next four years, but its lackluster sales in the United States have been a significant drag on meeting that goal. On Monday at the North American International Auto Show, the German automaker showed that it had no intention of scaling back those ambitions, announcing that it would bring new models to the United States and invest $7 billion in North American production. Volkswagen hopes the new models will bolster its lagging sales and help it reach its goal of selling a million Volkswagen and Audi brand vehicles in the United States by 2018. A day earlier, Martin Winterkorn, chairman of Volkswagen, said the company would invest the money over the next five years to produce a midsize sport utility vehicle for the American market and increase its dealer network. The United States market is crucial to helping Volkswagen achieve its goal to sell 10 million vehicles a year worldwide by 2018, but sales for its Volkswagen brand fell 6.9 percent last year, though the company got a lift from Audi, whose sales rose 13.5 percent. Advertisement Volkswagen, Kia and Volvo were the only three mainstream brands to post sales declines in 2013. Industry wide sales surged 7.6 percent for the year as consumer confidence rebounded and new models unleashed pent-up demand. The American market “is the second-largest new vehicle market globally and a core part of VW’s strategy to become the No. 1 automaker in the world,” said Tom Libby, an analyst with IHS automotive. “The company needs to regain the momentum and growth it had here prior to 2013.” Volkswagen trails Toyota and General Motors in worldwide sales. “Volkswagen needs both a compact and midsize S.U.V. here as soon as possible,” Mr. Libby said. The midsize seven-seat sport utility vehicle Volkswagen is building for the United States market will not go on sale until 2016. The automaker has not said where it plans to build the vehicle. At its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., the United Automobile Workers union has sought to organize the workers. On Monday, VW introduced two variations on its Golf compact car — a seventh-generation Golf R, which will go on sale in early 2015, and an eGolf electric car, which was first shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Michael Horn, incoming chief executive and president of the Volkswagen Group of America, on stage next to the Golf R, called it the highlight of the show. “I’ve got it at home in Germany in my garage.” But the new Golf models are unlikely to appeal to a broad enough market to lift sales by much, said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “While the Golf R and eGolf are exciting, it’s the full 2015 Golf line that will provide VW with the most significant boost in the near term,” Mr. Gutierrez said. “Golf sales were down significantly this year as most consumers interested in a Golf or GTI were delaying their purchase until the intro of the new generation which should launch early this year.” Advertisement Sales of the Golf, Volkswagen’s third most popular car after the Jetta compact and the Passat sedan, fell 24 percent last year to 30,931 vehicles. Production on the new Golf starts on Tuesday, in Puebla, Mexico, and will go on sale this summer. The weak spot in Volkswagen’s lineup, Mr. Gutierrez said, is lack of a more affordable and fuel-efficient update for the Tiguan sport utility vehicle. “This segment is growing and VW has failed to keep pace due to a high price point and fuel economy well below the industry average,” he said. The automaker will most likely get help from the Audi Q3 entry-level crossover it introduced in Detroit this week. Sales of luxury crossover utility vehicles are one of the strongest segments of the car market, rising 12.2 percent last year to outpace most of the industry, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 15. Advertisement   BRUSSELS — Brussels was thrown into great excitement to-day [Jan. 14] by a tragic event that happened in the courtyard of the house belonging to the Corporation of Fishmongers. Some days ago a traveling menagerie arrived in Brussels and attracted great attention by its enormous elephant. A boy of 17, who was employed at the menagerie, was in the habit of teazing the elephant by twisting his tail. The elephant never remonstrated with the boy and submitted to all his pranks with extraordinary patience. This morning the boy threw a bucketful of water over the elephant’s head. The weather was cold, and the elephant lost its temper. The pachydermatous, with one whisk of its trunk, seized the boy by the right ankle and whirled him twice over his head and then dashed him against the wall. Death was instantaneous. 1914: Assassination Attempt Fails  PARIS — General Sherif Pasha, formerly Turkish Minister in Stockholm, leader of the Ottoman Liberal Party,  was saved by his son-in-law from assassination at the hands of a Young Turk emissary in his apartment in Paris, yesterday.

Science   Over the Side With Old Scientific Tenets. Advertisement Advertisement Dennis Overbye OUT THERE JAN. 14, 2014 Here are some concepts you might consider tossing out with the Christmas wrappings as you get started on the new year: human nature, cause and effect, the theory of everything, free will and evidence-based medicine. Those are only a few of the shibboleths, pillars of modern thought or delusions — take your choice — that appear in a new compendium of essays by 166 (and counting) deep thinkers, scientists, writers, blowhards (again, take your choice) as answers to the question: What scientific idea is ready for retirement? The discussion is posted at edge.org. Take a look. No matter who you are, you are bound to find something that will drive you crazy. John Brockman, the literary agent and provocateur who presides over intellectual bar fights at Edge, his online salon, has been posing questions like this one since 1998. The questions have included what you believe but can’t prove, how the Internet is changing everything, and what you’ve changed your mind about. “It’s really the same thing every time,” Mr. Brockman said over the phone, explaining that this year’s question had arisen at a conference on the social sciences last summer and immediately engendered a debate about whether it was suitable for the Edge forum. Mr. Brockman’s contributors, many of whom are his clients, are a rambunctious lot who are unified by little more than a passion for ideas and the love of a good fight. (He represents several New York Times writers, although not this one.) Some are boldface names in the pop-science firmament, like Freeman Dyson, the mathematician and futurist at the Institute for Advanced Study; Steven Pinker, the best-selling linguist from Harvard; Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist and best-selling atheist from Oxford University; and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who invented the notion of flow, or being completely lost in what you are doing, and who says scientists need to let go of the idea that the truths they find are good for all time and place. “Some are indeed true,” Dr. Csikszentmihalyi says, “but others depend on so many initial conditions that they straddle the boundary between reality and fiction.” That thought was echoed by Alan Alda, the actor and science popularizer who criticizes the idea that things are either true or false, a staple of logic and math. Sometimes context matters. Advertisement Take death, which seems a pretty definitive state. “The body is just a lump,” Mr. Alda says. “Life is gone. But if you step back a bit, the body is actually in a transitional phase while it slowly turns into compost — capable of living in another way.” Frank Wilczek of M.I.T., a Nobel Prize winner in physics, would retire the distinction between mind and matter, a bedrock notion, at least in the West, since the time of Descartes. We know a lot more about matter and atoms now, Dr. Wilczek says, and about the brain. Matter, he says, “can dance in intricate, dynamic patterns; it can exploit environmental resources, to self-organize and export entropy.” We can teach it to play chess. But don’t get too excited. Roger Schank, a computer scientist and psychologist for the nonprofit group Engines for Education, says that a chess-playing computer won’t tell us anything about how or why humans play chess nor will it get interested in a new game when it gets bored. We should abolish the term “artificial intelligence,” he says, adding: “There really is no need to create artificial humans anyway. We have enough real ones already.” Stewart Brand, founder of the “Whole Earth Catalog,” among many things, wants to talk about nuclear power, which he argues has been hampered by the unprovable notion that no level of radiation, no matter how low, is safe. As a result, billions of extra dollars have been spent to provide “meaningless levels of safety” around nuclear power plants — meaningless because our cells contain mechanisms for repairing radiation damage to DNA and because, moreover, “we all die.” Professor Dawkins and Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist from Northeastern University, both attack the concept of essentialism, which holds that things like dogs and cats, triangles and trees, space and time, emotions and thoughts — all have an underlying essence that makes them what they are. This works great in math, Professor Dawkins argues, but is a disaster when applied to species or politics, disallowing the possibility of change or gradation. “Florida must go either wholly Republican or wholly Democrat — all 25 Electoral College votes — even though the popular vote is a dead heat,” he complains. (The number is now 29.) “But states should not be seen as essentially red or blue: they are mixtures in various proportions.” Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., claims we could get along just fine without the notion of infinity. The computer scientist W. Daniel Hillis of the technology company Applied Minds claims we can get along without the notion of cause and effect, which he says is just an artifact of our brains’ penchant for storytelling. Seth Lloyd, a computer scientist at M.I.T., says it’s time to lose the notion of a universe. Yes, nothing is sacred. Take evidence-based medicine, all the rage in the new age of health care. Gary Klein, a psychologist for the company MacroCognition, says the idea can impede medical progress by discouraging doctors from trying alternative treatments that have not been blessed by randomized controlled trials. He points out, for example, that many patients suffer from more conditions than experiments can control for. Advertisement Ian McEwan, the novelist, attacks this year’s question itself. Retire nothing, he says; science needs to hang onto its traditions and ideas. “Aristotle ranged over the whole of human knowledge and was wrong about much,” he says. “But his invention of zoology alone was priceless. Would you cast him aside? You never know when you might need an old idea.” The whole thing runs more than 120,000 words. You can dip into it anywhere and be maddened, confused or stirred. If there is an overall point, it is that there is no such thing as a stupid question. The true currency of science, after all, is not faith or even truth, but doubt. It’s hard to imagine a similar effort coming out of the College of Cardinals or the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. In science, as in democracy, everything has to be up for grabs. When the scientists and other intellectuals stop squabbling, then we will know we are in trouble.

Business   Consumers Can Check on Data Beyond Their Credit Reports. Advertisement Advertisement By ANN CARRNSJAN. 15, 2014 You most likely know the drill when it comes to the importance of checking the accuracy of your credit report, which lenders review before deciding to make a loan or issue a credit card. Federal law allows you to get a free copy of it once a year. But there are dozens of other companies that gather consumer data for narrower purposes, and they are also required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act to give you access to your report annually. They might gather information about your employment history, your medical conditions or your track record as a renter. Two companies may be relevant here. The Work Number, a service of Equifax Workforce Solutions, verifies job and income information for many big employers, lenders and government agencies. MIB Group, formerly known as the Medical Information Bureau, helps insurance companies with underwriting for consumers seeking life, disability or long-term care insurance, and similar types of coverage. I recently submitted annual disclosure requests to both companies, to see what sort of information they might have on me. The process was simple and relatively quick. In both cases, I received a written response in the mail in less than the two weeks suggested on the companies’ websites as typical response times. That could be because both had little information about me. Or it could be, in part, because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently prodded specialty companies to make sure they have easy-to-navigate systems for giving consumers timely access to disclosures. The Work Number verification service was created to help employers manage requests to confirm salary and employment information — for example, to verify a worker’s pay when he or she applies for a mortgage. Equifax Workforce Solutions, also known as the TALX Corporation, obtains its data directly from its employer clients, which it says number nearly 3,000, including most of the Fortune 500. Advertisement The Work Number’s clients provide data on employment, payroll and sometimes benefits, which is then made available, for a fee, to banks, employers and others authorized to receive it. Equifax says it provides information only to those with a legitimate reason to have it, and requires anyone seeking information on someone to obtain that person’s permission before it is released. My employment data report from The Work Number, which I requested by mail, included information about a prior employer. It listed my start and end dates; my biweekly salary; and the date and size of my last pay increase. It all looked correct — so any prospective employer checking my work history would have accurate information. Advertisement My disclosure from MIB, however, contained nothing at all. I requested my disclosure online, and received a letter a few days later stating simply that “MIB does not have a consumer file about you.” Why might that be? If you have never applied for insurance that required individual underwriting, or if it has been more than seven years since you applied, the bureau will not have any information on you. (Underwriting is the review process insurers conduct to determine if you are a good risk, and it can affect whether they offer you coverage and what your premiums are.) MIB is a cooperative that serves 450 insurance companies, providing them information to help evaluate people applying for individually underwritten insurance policies (as opposed to group policies, which usually do not require individual review). Member insurers report information to MIB, and other member insurers can get access to that data, with your permission (you generally give it when signing your application). MIB says its service can alert insurers to information — say, a condition like obesity, a bad driving record or even risky hobbies — that you may have “intentionally or inadvertently” neglected to report on an insurance application. An MIB spokesman, David Aronson, said the data-sharing helped keep insurance rates affordable by weeding out fraud. If MIB has a file on you, the disclosure letter would describe what information it contained — say, an indication of high blood pressure or diabetes — and which insurer provided it, Mr. Aronson said. MIB says it does not retain actual medical records, like X-rays or lab reports; rather, it uses proprietary codes to describe medical conditions. The conditions may flag a possible problem if they do not match up with what was said on an application. Insurers cannot deny you coverage or raise your premiums based on such information alone, he said, but must do their own investigation to confirm it. Here are some questions to consider when seeking annual disclosures: Q. How can I determine which companies might have information about me — and whether I’ve found them all? Advertisement A. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a list of these so-called specialty consumer reporting companies. More than 40 companies are on the list, although it’s not all-inclusive. “There’s no definitive list, so it’s kind of amorphous,” said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. The list, which groups the companies into categories, is a good start — but it may not be worth your time to contact all of them. The bureau advises, however, that you may want to check with “some or all” of the companies if you have been a victim of identity theft. Other situations in which you might want to check with a company include those in which you are applying for insurance or a lease on an apartment, or in which you have applied for a new job and your potential employer asks for authorization to seek a background report. Q. When should I request a disclosure from the specialty consumer reporting companies, and how do I do it? A. In general, it makes sense to request the reports if you think the information a specific company maintains may be relevant to your situation. Unlike with credit reports, there is not one central website where you can request annual reports from the specialty providers; you must apply to each company. Many provide one free report annually, although some can charge a small fee. Q. What sort of information do I need to provide when requesting a report? A. In general, be prepared to submit your name, date of birth and Social Security number; MIB also asks for information about your place of birth. The Work Number requests additional documentation when a request is submitted by mail, such as a copy of a driver’s license and a utility bill. (If your current employer is a client of The Work Number, you can usually obtain your report online at theworknumber.com.) Q. What if my report contains mistakes? A. You have the right to dispute inaccurate information, and the disclosure letter typically tells you what to do. If you are unhappy with the company’s response, you can complain to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Congo: Fighters Quit, U.N. Says. Advertisement Advertisement By SOMINI SENGUPTAJAN. 14, 2014 The head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Tuesday that 8,000 fighters affiliated with a variety of armed factions had surrendered since the M23 rebel group was routed in November. Among them are the Hutu militias that Rwanda holds responsible for the genocide 20 years ago. Martin Kobler, the United Nations’ special representative for Congo, said about 50 members of a Hutu group, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, had surrendered in each of the last two months alone, steadily diminishing what he said was a 1,800-strong force. He said his peacekeepers were focused on rooting out the rest, but warned that the group was not likely to be eliminated by military means alone.

Science   Shoring Up Those Fitness Resolutions Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement January is the cruelest month, at least for those with good intentions to get fit. According to recent analyses of decades’ worth of exercise studies, many new exercise “intenders” will abandon their workout routines within two weeks of their New Year’s resolutions, and about half will quit by June. Even longtime exercisers feel the pull of physical entropy. In any given year, around a quarter of the people who had been working out dutifully will stop. (And about 2 percent of those who claim to have no intention of exercising actually start and continue, baffling researchers and possibly the exercisers themselves.) Why we fail to realize our best exercise intentions is a complex interplay of psychology, physiology and genetics. Adult twins frequently have similar exercise patterns, suggesting that some portion of exercise motivation is inherited. Innate personality also plays a role, according to one of the new reviews published last fall in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Being extroverted makes it easier to stick with exercise resolutions, while being nice (or “agreeable,” in psychological terms) does not. But most quit exercising for more commonplace — and redressable — reasons. For instance, people make generic or unrealistic plans about where and when they will exercise, making them essentially fairy-tale wishes, says Ryan Rhodes, a professor of behavioral medicine at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, who has co-written several recent reviews and conducted numerous exercise-intention experiments. “Someone can plan to go to the gym Friday at 5:30 a.m. before work,” he says, but if he or she hates early rising or prebreakfast exertion, those plans will evaporate. What Dr. Rhodes describes as a “far more detailed strategy” that concretely addresses specific obstacles (Which bus runs at 5:30 a.m.? Gym bag packed and next to the door?) is more likely to motivate behavior. Also gauge “your daily fatigue and schedule exercise during times when you feel best,” he advises. But the most important factor when it comes to sticking with exercise is so obvious that it frequently goes unheeded. The appeals of physical fitness — good health, pleasing appearance, appropriate body weight — are vague and distant, and “the actual experience of exercise is not given much consideration,” Dr. Rhodes says. In other words, we don’t think about whether we like exercise before we embark on a regimen, yet our feelings about exercise predict “who translates their intentions into behavior,” as Dr. Rhodes puts it. So the first consideration is finding your exercise bliss. Typically this includes variety, novelty and competence. People who feel ungainly in a Zumba class won’t keep attending. Rewards, furthermore, are of limited value. Promise yourself an hour of television after 30 minutes of walking through the neighborhood, and the walk can seem more pleasurable. But naked greed is not much of a motivator. In a study published last year in Preventive Medicine, 117 college freshmen agreed to visit their school’s gym on a regular schedule. Some were then paid at least $10 weekly if they complied. After four months, the for-profit exercisers had visited the facility more times in total than the other students, but only 63 percent met the original agreed-upon goals, and everyone’s attendance had fallen off week by week. Even for the notoriously impecunious, cash cannot overcome lack of interest.

Travel   How to Choose an Air Travel Search Site. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 15, 2014 Which airline booking sites offer the cheapest airfares? If your answer was Expedia — or any of the other dozens of online travel agencies — you’re wrong. If it was “They’re all the same,” you’re definitely wrong. “It’s so overwhelming, I have no idea”? You’re getting close. The real solution is finding the sites that best fit your specific travel needs — all the more true for the heavily budget-conscious. Each has different strengths offered through different interfaces that use different functions and produce different results. But where to go for what? Even for people like me who live on these sites, it’s not always clear. So I designed a test — from Europe, as it turned out, where I was reporting on the road. I selected 15 online travel agencies, from the old stalwarts like Travelocity to an excellent (and increasingly robust) group of upstarts like Routehappy, which are more likely to take into account niche specifics like seat pitch. Then I put them through the wringer, shopping for six itineraries, from basic domestic to overseas-only to elaborately multicity: Miami-Chicago, Louisville-Portland, Los Angeles-Paris, Dallas-Singapore, Shanghai-Chengdu in China and, finally, New York-Guadalajara-Bogotá-Charlotte (presumably a Mexican-Colombian-American visiting family and the Nascar Hall of Fame). I should note that I couldn’t include every site in my tests, and left out a popular one I couldn’t figure out how to use abroad: Bing Travel. As I learned too late from a spokeswoman, it only works in the United States. There’s a workaround — you can switch settings to “tailor” your search to “the United States — English,” But that’s one extra hassle I wasn’t willing to take on. That said, the results? For one, my eyes hurt. But more important, I created what I hope is a useful (though not definitive) guide to which sites work best under which circumstances. Advertisement If Cheap Is All That Matters The sites you’ve certainly heard of — Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz — were all dependably similar, their lowest offerings rarely differing more than a few dollars. But the upstarts occasionally beat them. For that Miami-Chicago flight, the old guard circled around $378. But Routehappy found one for $361, and I followed it through to just before the final click, and it was legit. (Momondo gets an honorable mention at $364.) So the best technique here is to check one of the traditional sites, and then play around with the new guys and see if they can pull an upset. Then, before you book, check the airline’s own website to make sure it’s not even cheaper there. (And don’t forget that Southwest — by its own choice — doesn’t show up on most sites.) And as long as you’ve popped over, it’s almost always a good idea to do the actual booking from the airline’s site: It’s often easier — and rarely harder — to take care of the minutiae (entering your awards number, choosing seats and paying for extra luggage, as well as changing your reservation down the line if necessary). When You Want Cheap — Within Limits Sometimes the sites think more like soulless machines than like humans. On occasion they’ll list a $400 flight with a 12-hour layover before a $401 flight with a 90-minute layover — not a choice most travelers would make. Just ask it to sort by trip length, you say? Then that $401 flight might disappear under an avalanche of $9,999 flights with 89-minute layovers. O.K., that’s an exaggeration, but it’s a real issue: Even cheapskates will sometimes pay $50 to shave six hours off a layover. That’s when you turn to sites like Hipmunk, where the default setting orders the flights by “agony,” dropping flights with long layovers or sky-high prices down the list. This worked especially well with that Dallas-Singapore route, where, after a great deal of sorting on Expedia and Travelocity, I finally decided the cheapest tolerable flight was $1,174, with a total trip time of 25 hours, 10 minutes out and 23 hours, 42 minutes back. When I tried the same search on Hipmunk, it put that precise itinerary right at the top. Routehappy’s algorithm includes other factors you might be willing to pay more for, including seat space and electrical outlets; their top choice (without changing the default preferences) was a $1,555 Korean Air itinerary with an extra three inches and three fewer hours. Worth it? That’s up to you. If You’re Booking a Domestic Route on Short Notice Priceline’s opaque bidding system works well with hotels — I’ve often saved 30 to 50 percent on hotels by placing an absurdly low bid and allowing the site to charge my card before it told me exactly which hotel I was paying for. Savings are less and more rare on flights, but do exist, particularly on domestic flights booked just a few days in advance. Savings top out at about 40 percent, so try bidding 10 or 20 percent below the cheapest standard fare. If your bid fails, no problem: Book through Priceline’s regular service, which fared as well as other big-name sites on my tests. Two caveats: You can choose the date but not the departure time of your flight (or the airline), and you might be stuck with an annoying layover. But other than advance planning, I don’t know a better way to shave dollars off a standard domestic ticket. When Your Dates or Destination Are Flexible Most of the bigger sites (notable exception: Expedia) offer to find you cheaper flights if you’re willing to fly one to three days earlier or later. That was a nice innovation in 2010, but these days their systems seem inflexible, and the resulting grids dizzying. Much better are the far more intuitive bar graphs you get on Momondo and Google Flight Explorer. There’s also GetGoing, which will give you a discount if you give it two destinations you like and let it pick one. And at Adioso, one of the newer sites in my survey, you start by just typing in your starting point and destination, and mold preferences from there. That won’t work for Thanksgiving visits to family, though, and the results can be hit or miss. (The company is promising lots of improvements in 2014.) If You Have Commitment Issues For a few bucks, Options Away will hold your reservation for between a day and a few weeks. That’s great if, for example, you need to coordinate plans with others. Two problems: It only works on domestic flights within a limited list of cities, and its base rates are not always competitive. On that Miami-Chicago route, the site’s best base price was $400, versus the standard $378 I found everywhere else. So in that case, the $10 premium you pay to hold your ticket for a week is actually more like $32 if you end up buying it. When You Need a Complex, Multi-Leg Route Not every site allows multi-leg itineraries. Of those that do, I used to recommend Vayama for multi-leg, international searches. But when it came time to test my New York-Guadalajara-Bogotá-Charlotte route, its “Multi Cities” function flunked on two attempts, issuing a “We’re sorry, Vayama could not find any matching flights” message. Meanwhile, Expedia and Orbitz didn’t bat an eye, spitting out multiple quality choices as easily as if I had asked to book the New York-Washington shuttle. The best options were packages for about $1,040 adding up to about 30 hours of travel time. Travelocity did too, but only after I finally found the multi-leg function hidden in “Advanced Search Options”; Hipmunk and Momondo wasted my time with flights that disappeared when I went to book them; and Kayak simply overwhelmed me with too many options, forcing me to click through page after page of near-identical offerings to find something different (and their filters barely helped). Advertisement If Your Trip Starts and Ends Outside North America or Europe This one gets tricky. American and European sites often can’t find cheap fares on regional carriers elsewhere in the world. So start elsewhere. Googling or asking foreign friends is a good start; they might lead you to sites like Brazil’s Submarino Viagens (alas, not in English) and China’s Ctrip (sometimes buggy). That’s where I began my Shanghai-Chengdu search, finding a $253 nonstop using Shanghai Airlines out and Air China back. When the site kept demanding a phone number that I had already given, an online chat representative helped me with a workaround so I could book; of course, I could have also gone to the airlines’ sites. As expected, the regulars mostly bombed: The best deals on Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz topped $500; Hipmunk and Cheapoair were over $400. But then a surprise: Kayak and Momondo unearthed a $233 flight on Spring Airlines, a low-cost carrier that Ctrip left out. I was sent to the airline’s site to book, but it worked smoothly. Quite an upset, but don’t count on that happening every time. When You’re Pressed for Time For those who want to book an entire trip — flight, hotel, car rental — in one place, the traditional sites will definitely save you time. But if you’re focused just on flights, there are other considerations. Most straightforward is the amount of time it takes each site to process your searches. The clear winner there is Google Flights (a different offering from Google Flight Explorer), with shockingly instantaneous results — you’d almost think they’d invented the modern search engine. But it occasionally costs you time while booking. They’re not alone in forcing you to other sites to book, but only on Google did I sometimes have to re-enter my search details once transferred. (In one case it even told me to call a travel agent!) For a Better Online Experience Some sites are particularly pleasant to use, in both superficial and substantive ways: Hipmunk’s graphic displays of flights and layovers; Kayak’s input simplicity; Momondo’s clear presentation of great information about options. Losers here were Cheapoair, for frequently kicking me off to a results page before I had completed my search (I must have continuously hit some shortcut key accidentally, but it didn’t happen anywhere else) and Travelocity, which has an unpleasant interface. One strike against Momondo: I was often directed to European booking sites, which charged me in euros, forcing me to seek out conversion rates and making me nervous about whether my own card would give me the same rate. (Some cards, though not mine, also charge for international transactions.) See More » Go to Home Page »

Washington   Snowden to Join Board of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Advertisement Advertisement By CHARLIE SAVAGEJAN. 14, 2014 Washington — Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor whose leaks of secret documents set off a national and global debate about government spying, is joining the board of a nonprofit organization co-founded by Daniel Ellsberg, the well-known leaker of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. The announcement by the group, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, is the latest contribution to a public relations tug of war between Mr. Snowden’s critics, who portray him as a criminal and a traitor, and his supporters, who say he is a whistle-blower and source for the news media in the tradition of Mr. Ellsberg. The foundation’s board already includes two of the journalists Mr. Snowden gave N.S.A. documents to, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. But the organization — which consulted with lawyers about whether adding Mr. Snowden to its board could jeopardize its nonprofit tax status — is trying to emphasize parallels between Mr. Snowden and Mr. Ellsberg. In 1971, the Nixon administration charged Mr. Ellsberg with violating the Espionage Act because he gave the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of decision-making about the Vietnam War, to The New York Times and other newspapers. A court eventually threw out the case for government misconduct. Mr. Snowden has been charged under that same law. “He is no more of a traitor than I am, and I am not a traitor,” Mr. Ellsberg said in an interview. He added that he was proud that Mr. Snowden would serve alongside him on the group’s board, calling Mr. Snowden a hero who “has done more for our Constitution in terms of the Fourth and First Amendment” than anyone else Mr. Ellsberg knows. Advertisement The announcement comes days after the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee sought to paint a far more sinister portrait of Mr. Snowden, saying he had aligned himself with America’s enemies and jeopardized national security. They cited a classified defense intelligence report they said concluded that most of the documents he took concerned military activities rather than civil liberties. “Make no mistake, Snowden is no patriot and there is no way to excuse the irreparable harm he caused to America and her allies, and continues to cause,” said the chairman, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan. He added that Mr. Snowden’s “real acts of betrayal” were “likely to have lethal consequences for our troops in the field.” Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer advising Mr. Snowden, called such criticism “exaggerated national security fears” that amounted to “an attack on the journalists who have published the stories based on the documents.” He added. “The government said much more dire things about what would happen if The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers. None of them turned out to be true.” In a statement provided by the foundation, Mr. Snowden said he was honored to serve the cause of a free press “alongside extraordinary Americans like Daniel Ellsberg.” Because Mr. Snowden is living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum, he will participate in board meetings by a remote link, according to the group’s director, Trevor Timm. Mr. Timm said that before offering Mr. Snowden a position, the group consulted with lawyers about whether doing so could create legal problems. The Internal Revenue Service recently granted the group nonprofit status under a section of the tax code that allows donors to deduct contributions from their taxable income, he said. The lawyers, he said, concluded that Mr. Snowden’s participation as a board member — an unpaid position — should not jeopardize that status because the I.R.S. has not penalized other groups with board members under indictment. Rather, such tax status is generally put at risk when groups stray from their mission. Mr. Timm said that the foundation’s mission was to encourage “news organizations to publish government secrets in the public interest and for brave whistle-blowers to come forward, even though it is personally very risky.” He added: “Snowden embodies exactly what we started this organization for, so I think we’re pretty safe.” Advertisement The foundation was started 14 months ago for the initial purpose of enabling donations to WikiLeaks after firms like PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa began refusing to process contributions. It rapidly expanded into other activities, including raising funds for other organizations and hiring a stenographer to produce daily transcripts of the court-martial trial of Chelsea Manning, then known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks’ main source. It raised about $650,000 last year, Mr. Timm said, of which about $500,000 went to various other organizations, including about $200,000 to WikiLeaks. The group is increasingly focused on helping journalists protect the security of their communications, including by disseminating and managing a free software system to enable would-be sources to send leaked files to journalists in a way it says can evade surveillance. “Journalism isn’t possible unless reporters and their sources can safely communicate, and where laws can’t protect that, technology can,” Mr. Snowden said in his statement. “This is a hard problem, but not an unsolvable one, and I look forward to using my experience to help find a solution.” A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2014, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Snowden Joins Board of Press Group Founded by Daniel Ellsberg.

Business   What’s in a Name? The Equus Bass770. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 16, 2014 DETROIT — Equus is Latin for horse. It’s also English for a certain Hyundai model, but don’t tell that to Equus Automotive. Michael Qualid, a spokesman for the company, said that Equus didn’t know the name had been in use on Hyundai’s premier luxury model when Equus opened in 2006, but he expressed hope that the Korean automaker would not come after a niche marque over its name. The Equus Bass770, a retro muscle car on display in a corner of the Detroit auto show, is not a ’67 or ’68 Ford Mustang fastback, but it looks exactly like one. Even the interior, filled with modern necessities such as high seat backs and air bags, features a look that brings its viewer into a leather-wrapped 1960s muscle-car cave. But even though it has the same profile and many of the same body creases as the Mustang, all similarities end there. The Equus is nearly 10 inches longer, about 5 inches wider and 3 inches taller than the Mustang made famous by the “Bullitt” chase scene. That’s because the car’s aluminum frame and carbon-fiber and aluminum body are, although assembled to look like an old Mustang, made from scratch, Mr. Qualid said. It also has a General Motors engine under its long hood. The car’s front clip looks like it came from the early ‘70s Mopar playbook. The tail lights could have been adapted from a late ‘60s Camaro. Equus does say in its sales brochure that the Bass770 was “born of an abiding passion for genuine 1960s and 1970s muscle cars,” so it’s good to know that all three Detroit automakers appear to have been represented in some manner, if only vestigially. The cars are built in Rochester Hills, Mich. Equus engineers placed the car’s 640-horsepower LS9 supercharged 6.2-liter V8 (used in the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1) as far back as possible, to improve weight distribution and to create a long energy absorption zone forward of the engine. If you’ve ever looked beneath the hood of a ’68 Mustang, there’s some room between the radiator and the grille, but in the Equus interpretation, there’s a lot of space there, because the engine lives pretty far aft in a slight divot in the firewall. Equus says the Bass770 meets federal motor vehicle safety certification standards. Mr. Qualid said that by having a small passenger compartment within a long body, it was possible to incorporate big crumple zones into the design. As for its emissions certification, he said that Equus had not received it yet, but that since the LS9 is already a certified engine, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for the company. He also said that Equus is working toward getting European safety and emissions certifications for the car. Advertisement The cars Equus brought to Detroit this week — one red, another white and the other blue – looked good. But there were a few little details the boutique automaker may want to address before attempting to sell a $250,000 sports coupe. For example, the rear decklid on the white car didn’t look as if it fit perfectly. On the dashboard of the red car, I believe I saw some slight wrinkles and uneven stitching in the leather that in a Ferrari of similar price, you would never, ever see. Mr. Qualid said that Equus hoped to sell 100 cars in the first year of production; perhaps as many as 200 a year later on. Although the company’s name could be a potential legal issue with Hyundai, Mr. Qualid said that Equus had not been contacted about it. Jim Trainor, a spokesman from Hyundai, said he was “very familiar” with the Equus Bass770, but declined to comment on the Equus name. The Equus logo seems safe from legal attack, though. Like the Mustang’s logo, it’s a horse, but unlike the Mustang’s logo, the image is not a profile of a horse in full gallop. Nor is the horse prancing, like the one in the Ferrari logo. The Equus horse assumes a stance vaguely similar to the Lamborghini bulls. But instead of having its head lowered, preparing to charge, the Equus horse appears to be rearing back, as if spooked. The model name is a bit nebulous. Ian James, a spokesman for Equus, said in a telephone interview that the 770 stands for the volume, in cubic centimeters, of each of the engine’s eight cylinders. But as for the Bass — as in the musical instrument, not the fish — part of it Mr. James said was simply a name the company had settled upon when it decided to build the car. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Military Opens Investigation Into Photos of Dead Iraqi Militants. Advertisement Advertisement By ASHLEY SOUTHALLJAN. 16, 2014 The United States military said it had begun an inquiry after photographs that appeared to show Marines burning the dead bodies of Iraqi militants appeared on a gossip website. The photos were obtained by the website, TMZ.com, which published some of them online on Wednesday. TMZ said the photos were shot in Falluja sometime in 2004. Two of the photos posted on Wednesday show a man in a Marine’s uniform pouring liquid from a gasoline can on two decaying bodies. Two other photos show the bodies on fire, and two more show the charred remains. In one photo a man poses on one knee with his rifle pointed toward a human skeleton. In another, a man is running his hands through the pants pockets of one of the bodies. TMZ said the pictures showed more than a dozen bodies. The site posted eight of 41 pictures, withholding the rest because it said they were “too gruesome.” TMZ said it turned over all the photographs to the Department of Defense last week. The website did not say when or how it obtained them. Navy Cmdr. Bill Speaks confirmed in an email that the Marine Corps was investigating. “We are aware of photos appearing on TMZ.com that depict individuals in U.S. Marine uniforms burning what appear to be human remains,” he said. “The actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members, nor do they represent the honorable and professional service of the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Advertisement Commander Speaks added that the Marines were “investigating the veracity of the photos, circumstances involved, and if possible, the identities of the service members involved. The findings from this investigation will determine whether we are able to move forward with any investigation into possible wrongdoing.” TMZ also reported that the United States Central Command, which runs military operations in the Middle East, said that the photographs had not been previously brought to its attention. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, mishandling human remains in a war zone is a crime for which there is no statute of limitations. However, if those involved are now private citizens, the military would have to recall them to active duty to face charges, a potentially complex legal procedure. Falluja, in Iraq’s Anbar Province, was the site of a November 2004 battle where about 100 Marines died. In recent weeks, the city has fallen into the hands of Sunni insurgents, some backed by Al Qaeda, who have raised their black insurgent flag over government buildings. A year ago, a video that showed Marines urinating on the bodies of dead Afghans threatened to upend delicate talks among the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban. A Marine involved in that episode, which officials said occurred in 2011, pleaded guilty in December 2012, and was sentenced to a reduction in rank and a forfeiture of $500 in pay. The Marine, Staff Sgt. Joseph Chamblin, said he had no regrets and that he would do it again as revenge for the deaths of American service members. Go to Home Page »
Home   Just for You, Blue. Advertisement Advertisement On Location By ELAINE LOUIE JAN. 15, 2014 What do you do when you love bright color but don’t want to be overwhelmed by it? Hire a designer who works almost entirely in white. It sounds counterintuitive, but it made sense to Rhonda Weinman, 55, a financial planner with a house on Long Island who asked her friend Peri Wolfman to design an apartment on the Upper West Side. Years ago, Ms. Wolfman and her husband, Charles Gold, owned Wolfman-Gold and Good Company, one of the first stores in SoHo to carry tableware in just one color: white. Later, she was the tableware designer for Restoration Hardware, where much of what she produced was white. Her own homes and most of the furnishings are white; even her clothing is primarily white. As she put it, “I’m allergic to color.” None of that worried Ms. Weinman, who rents the 500-square-foot studio for $3,500 a month to use as a weekend pied-à-terre. She’s a pro, Ms. Weinman thought. She’ll do what the client wants. But when Ms. Weinman told her friend that what she wanted was an apartment decorated in one of her favorite colors, which happen to be fuchsia, purple and turquoise, it was almost a deal-breaker. Advertisement Fuchsia and purple were out of the question. “But I like turquoise,” Ms. Wolfman said. “So I took a deep breath and said, ‘For you, Rhonda, I can do turquoise.’ ” Ms. Wolfman painted just two areas of the studio that color — the front door and the walls surrounding the sleeping area — so the bed appears to be in a turquoise room of its own. All the other walls are white, and so are the ceilings. “The ceiling couldn’t be turquoise,” Ms. Wolfman said. “It would have been oppressive.” To soften the color, she added pale gray furniture. And in the kitchen, she hung a huge, dark gray aluminum clock. “I like things oversized in a small apartment,” she said. “It makes it feel like a bigger space.” Ms. Wolfman, who was given an $18,000 budget, finished within a month, from paint and furniture to flatware and bedding, shopping mostly at CB2, West Elm, Wisteria.com and Restoration Hardware. And in September, Ms. Weinman moved in. Since then, she has spent nearly every weekend at the apartment. She considers it a personalized version of the hotel rooms where she used to stay when she came to the city. It even has a safe, in a corner of the closet. But now, if she moves, Ms. Weinman knows she can take the décor with her. Everything except the turquoise walls.

Science   Think Like a Doctor: A School of Red Herrings Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. The Challenge: Can you figure out what is wrong with a 29-year-old former volleyball player who develops some odd aches and pains and a swollen foot? Every month the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to take on a difficult case and offer their solutions to a diagnostic riddle. This month’s case revolves around an athletic and previously healthy 29-year-old woman who developed a pain in her groin, a swollen foot and ankle and a slew of lab abnormalities. We will provide you with many of the notes and tests from the many doctors who saw this patient. The first reader to provide the correct test to make the diagnosis gets a signed copy of my book “Every Patient Tells a Story” and the satisfaction of unraveling a tough tough case. The Patient’s Story: “Is your blood pressure always this high?” Dr. Becky Miller asked the young woman who had come to see her. Until recently it had been fine, the slender 29-year-old told her. It was kind of crazy because she’d been healthy her whole life, the young woman continued. But these past several months she’d been seeing doctors almost weekly, and it seemed like every time anyone checked, her blood pressure was high. Dr. Miller was the newest specialist the young woman had been sent to since her ordeal began eight months earlier. It started innocuously enough. She’d enrolled in a new Pilates class and somehow injured her left hip. As a high school athlete and, briefly, a professional volleyball player, she knew the ache of a pulled groin muscle, but this felt worse — a lot worse. Walking hurt, even sitting hurt; exercise was impossible. She asked around and found an orthopedic surgeon in her Los Angeles neighborhood. He diagnosed her with a grade 2 sprain in her groin muscles and sent her for physical therapy. That didn’t help. Then several weeks in, with her hip still bothering her, her left foot and ankle swelled up. A Long List of Doctors: The young woman went to her primary care doctor. He was the first to take note of her elevated blood pressure. Let’s keep an eye on that, he told her. He wasn’t much concerned with the swelling; she should just take it easy and use compression stockings when she needed them. That didn’t sit right with her. She felt like this was more than just the pulled muscle, so she went to her endocrinologist. He had helped her a couple of years earlier when she’d had irregular periods. Back then he figured out that she had too much of a hormone known as prolactin, which was messing up her menstrual cycle. An M.R.I. of her brain showed a tiny spot on her pituitary gland, the likely cause of the excess hormone. He put her on a medication called bromocriptine to block the prolactin and her periods improved, though they were still irregular. The endocrinologist wasn’t sure what had caused her swollen foot. He ordered an ultrasound to look for a clot in that leg, but no clot was found. He ordered a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to see whether something might be getting in the way of the blood flowing back into her heart. No obstruction was found, but the scan did reveal that her spleen was somewhat enlarged. The endocrinologist sent her to a G.I. specialist, who scoped her. He saw some gastritis, but nothing that would cause a big spleen. However, a blood test revealed that she had too many red blood cells — an unusual finding, especially in a young woman who was still menstruating. So he sent her up the street to Dr. Becky Miller, a hematologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Patient’s History: When the patient walked into Dr. Miller’s cheerful waiting room that morning, the first thing she noticed was that she was the youngest patient in the office by a good 20 to 30 years. That scared her a little. Still, Dr. Miller’s cheerful manner and brightly colored crocs put her at ease. The doctor led her to a couple of armchairs in the middle of a homey office, and she launched into her by now well-rehearsed story about her symptoms, doctors and tests. Dr. Miller paid close attention, nodding and jotting down notes in the pad on her lap. When the doctor examined her, she seemed quite surprised by the high blood pressure reading. The patient was quite tall, 5-foot-10, and slender, 150 pounds, with an athletic build. No, she told the doctor, she’d never had high blood pressure until her doctor had noticed it earlier that year. The young woman looked quite healthy. She had a couple of tattoos on her back and arm. And some tenderness in the upper left quarter of the abdomen, where her spleen was located. Her left ankle was still a little swollen. The rest of her exam was normal. Some Unusual Lab Results: Dr. Miller had already reviewed the lab test results obtained by the gastroenterologist; they showed that the patient had a hematocrit of 50. Normal, for a woman, is usually up to 40. The labs sent to Dr. Miller can be seen here.   Dr. Miller first considered causes of the patient’s elevated hematocrit and enlarged spleen. She was worried that this was some type of cancer. Could this be polycythemia vera, an abnormal proliferation of red blood cells? Or was this leukemia? She sent blood off to be tested for these illnesses, and when the results came back negative, she sent the patient for a bone marrow biopsy. She was reassured when that was unrevealing as well, so she turned her focus to the other medical issue: the patient’s relatively new high blood pressure. You can see Dr. Miller’s note here.   Looking for a Cause of High Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is certainly common. One out of three Americans have it, and for well over 90 percent of them, no cause will be found — a condition called essential hypertension. Many of these individuals will need lifelong drug treatment along with a low-salt diet and regular exercise to prevent complications from their disease. However, in 5 to 10 percent of cases, high blood pressure has an underlying and, more importantly, treatable cause. Address the cause, and the high blood pressure will usually resolve. The trick is to identify those few who have high blood pressure as a symptom of another problem from the many who have essential hypertension. This patient was at increased risk for hypertension — her father had it. Still, could some medical problem be causing her blood pressure to rise? And if so, was it also linked to her swollen ankle and high red blood cell count? The doctor started the patient on an antihypertensive medication, lisinopril, and began looking for something that could have made this young woman’s blood pressure rise. Was there a diagnosis that could make all these symptoms make sense? Feeling the Pressure: Medications are the by far most common cause of an elevated blood pressure. Many everyday over-the-counter drugs, including painkillers like ibuprofen or decongestants like Sudafed, can raise blood pressure. So can alcohol or stimulants like caffeine, nicotine or cocaine. Ordinary prescription drugs like antidepressants, Ritalin or birth control pills can too. But this patient told Dr. Miller that she took none of those drugs, rarely drank alcohol and never smoked. In children, the most common cause of high blood pressure is a narrowing, or coarctation, of the aorta. If the condition is not found in childhood, it will continue to cause high blood pressure in adults. A difference in blood pressure between the left and right arm can suggest this problem. This patient’s blood pressure was the same in both arms. Another treatable cause of high blood pressure is narrowing of the smaller arteries leading to the kidneys, but a CT scan of the abdomen showed normal vessels. You can see the report of the CT scan here.   Finally, some diseases cause excess secretion of body chemicals like thyroid hormone, adrenaline or cortisol that can raise blood pressure. The hematologist sent off tests looking for any of these, and when several came back abnormal, Dr. Miller sent the patient back to her endocrinologist. You can see the results of the testing that Dr. Miller ordered here.   The endocrinologist ordered several tests to try to figure out what was going on. One of them was quite revealing. Solving the Mystery: Now I ask you, gentle reader, if you could order only one test to figure out what was wrong with this patient, which test would you order to lead you most rapidly to the right diagnosis? And what is the correct diagnosis? I’ll post the answer tomorrow.    Join in the discussion.    Rules and Regulations: Post your responses in the comments section.

Sports   In Wilting Heat, Sharapova Escapes 2nd Round. Advertisement Advertisement By GREG BISHOPJAN. 16, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — As her match dragged more than three hours, Maria Sharapova stomped and grunted and stole glances at her box. Her face twisted into grimaces. She seemed happiest on changeovers, underneath the shade of an umbrella, an ice vest draped over the back of her neck. So much appeared stacked against her: temperatures that climbed to 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) and forced Australian Open officials to invoke their “extreme heat policy” and shut down play on the outside courts; a serve that turned shaky with a series of double faults; and an opponent, Karin Knapp of Italy, who played a fearless brand of tennis, as if buoyed by the heat. Sharapova botched three match points earlier in the third set, as momentum swung in Knapp’s direction. Inside Rod Laver Arena, the air felt thick, heavy, even with the roof partially closed to provide shade. Programs became makeshift fans. Empty water bottles filled trash cans. To say it was hot was to say there was tennis — two obvious assertions. Knapp slung winners from the baseline, hitting harder, her shots more daring the later the match went. Sharapova fought. She fought through three doubles faults. She fought through temperatures that turned Melbourne Park into tennis’s Mojave Desert. She fought until ahead late in the third set, when Knapp sent a backhand long and their contest ended, finally, mercifully, the tally 6-3, 4-6, 10-8. Sharapova advanced to the third round. So many questions lingered afterward. They centered on whether the match should have been finished at all under such sauna-like conditions. The participants were not so sure — and clearly not that happy. Advertisement “There is no getting around the fact that the conditions were extremely difficult, and have been for the last few days,” Sharapova said. Sharapova took the most issue with the uncertainty involved. She noted that players do not know at what temperature matches will be stopped — because there is no exact temperature but rather the discretion of the tournament referee. She said she received her first weather-related notification from tournament officials after her match, while she was in an ice bath. She also said she did not want to complain, and that she never considered on court whether the temperatures were too high, the conditions too dangerous. She thought only about winning, surviving, making it through to the next round. Knapp was asked the same questions afterward. “Maybe they should change some rules,” she said. “Because it’s not the same like playing under the roof. It was really tough.” Their match lasted for three hours and 28 minutes. But while the third set continued without an end in sight, the Open announced the implementation of its extreme heat policy. It was the third day a heat wave here that had resulted in lowered attendance; caused one player to faint on court and another player to vomit; and left one participant, Ivan Dodig of Croatia, to say Wednesday “I was thinking I could die here” after cramps forced him to retire from a singles match. When the policy went into effect, it meant that no matches were played on the outside courts until 6 p.m. local time, a break of four hours. Play continued at Rod Laver and Hisense arenas, where the roofs were closed. None of that helped Sharapova, her face the picture of agony. The chair umpire warned Sharapova for taking too long on her serve, and the third seed shot an icy glare in the umpire’s direction. Both players tried to step into the shade behind the baselines between points until the next serve. Whenever Sharapova seemed to take control, Knapp countered. She stepped into her groundstrokes, took the ball early, sent flat backhands into corners to force Sharapova to give chase. Advertisement Sharapova eventually recovered. She ripped a forehand winner down the line to break Knapp at 8-8. The crowd stood and cheered and reached for the closest nearby beverage. “I had to play, and I had to finish the match and do it the best I can,” Sharapova said. “It’s not the best conditions, but I don’t want to complain.” When it ended, Sharapova pumped both fists and walked toward the net. She did not look happy so much as she looked relieved. Next up: air conditioning and sleep. Go to Home Page »
Technology   Milestones in Marissa Mayer’s Tenure as Yahoo’s C.E.O.. Advertisement Advertisement As Yahoo’s chief executive, Ms. Mayer has acquired more than 20 companies, but is now facing a spinoff of the company’s core business in an attempt to rejuvenate the once-dominant Internet giant. UPDATED April 15, 2016 Yahoo and its chief executive abolish the company's work-at-home policy in an effort to reinvigorate the once-dominant Internet pioneer. The move is seen as a reaction by a company in crisis mode, and is immediately met with criticism. “This isn’t a broad industry view on working from home,” according to a statement from the company. “This is about what is right for Yahoo right now.” The company doubles the time new parents are allowed to take off, an olive branch after receiving negative attention for revamping its work-at-home policy. Ms. Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, has said that attracting talented workers is crucial for the company’s turnaround. Since arriving at Yahoo, Ms. Mayer has increased the amount of perks employees receive, including handing out smartphones and free lunches in the company cafeteria. Days after the company unveiled the second redesign of its mail service under Ms. Mayer's leadership, thousands of users express their displeasure with the changes. Several groups form online, advocating to change it back. With an estimated 275 million users, Yahoo used to be the most popular email service in the United States. But it has been surpassed in recent years by Google’s Gmail service and Microsoft’s Hotmail offering. Yahoo users suspect the new Yahoo Mail was the company's unsuccessful attempt to mimic Gmail, which Ms. Mayer had a hand in overseeing while she worked at Google. Looking to further restore the company's diminished profile, Ms. Mayer hires Katie Couric to be the "global anchor" for Yahoo, a role that is likely to include interviewing major newsmakers as well as an expansion of the company's news operations. "We both speak the same language and share the same sensibilities," Ms. Couric says of Ms. Mayer. A prominent activist investor, the hedge fund Starboard Value, urges Yahoo to forgo a plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba and instead sell its core business. Starboard argues that the reason for spinning off the Alibaba stake — avoiding taxes while raising money for shareholders — appears to have evaporated after the Internal Revenue Service declined to provide any guidance about the tax liability related to the spinoff. Yahoo drops a plan to spin off its $31 billion stake in Alibaba. Instead, the company will spin off all of its other assets, including its stake in Yahoo Japan, into a new company. After spinning off the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, Ms. Mayer had planned to focus on improving the company’s core business, the sale of advertising that is shown to the roughly one billion users of Yahoo’s apps and websites. Ms. Mayer is effectively back to square one in her attempts to turn around the beleaguered Internet giant.

Business   Sharing Web Links Without Cutting and Pasting. Advertisement Advertisement Q&A By J. D. BIERSDORFER JAN. 17, 2014 Q. Is there an easier way to email a web page link on the Nexus 7 than copying and pasting the link from the browser into the mail app? A. If you are using the standard Chrome browser that comes with the Android operating system on the Nexus 7, go to the page URL you want to send. Tap the icon on the far-right side of the menu bar; the icon looks like a vertical stack of three dots. When the menu opens, tap Share. On the Share menu, you can do multiple things with the URL for the open web page, like posting it to a Twitter, Google Plus or Facebook account, or sending it to another device over a wireless Bluetooth connection. Or easily paste the link into the body of an email by tapping either Gmail or Email — whichever mail program you use on the tablet — on the list of sharing options. A new message will pop open with the link in the body. You just need to enter an address in the To field and add any explanatory text necessary in the body of the message. Other Android-compatible browsers most likely have a similar menu or button for sharing web page links by mail. If you are using Dolphin or another browser on your tablet, check the browser window for a sharing menu or icon. Preparing for the End of Windows XP Q. I’m not sure if my hardware can handle an upgrade from Windows XP to a newer version of Windows. What are my options once Microsoft kills off Windows XP this spring? Advertisement A. As Microsoft has been reminding its customers for many months, support for its Windows XP operating system ends on April 8. (The company has a site dedicated to getting people off its outdated, insecure Internet Explorer 6 browser as well.) While your Windows XP computer will continue to run, Microsoft will not be providing security updates and other patches to keep the system safer from viruses and other malware attacks. The company also announced that it would not be providing an XP-compatible version of its Microsoft Security Essentials software on its site, either. Microsoft has two suggestions for those still using Windows XP: upgrade the operating system or buy a new PC. The system requirements for Windows 8.1, the latest operating system, may be a little high for older hardware. You need a machine with at least a 1-gigahertz processor, 1 gigabyte of memory, 16 gigabytes of hard drive space and a graphics card compatible with DirectX9 and the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) software. Microsoft’s site has a tutorial on potentially upgrading from Windows XP, including links to an upgrade assistant program that checks your current machine to see if it can run Windows 8.1. You can check to see if your older programs work on Windows 8.1 on the Compatibility Center page. If neither of these options sounds appealing or possible, you have other choices. You can continue on with Windows XP with third-party security software, although you may find fewer sites, services and programs that continue to work with an operating system that was first released in 2001. Although it may take some heavy lifting and expertise, some people have found extended life for old hardware by installing the open-source Linux operating system, which tends to have less-intensive system requirements than other operating systems. The jump to Linux may not be for everyone, especially those with the need to run Windows-only programs, but you can still use word-processing programs, browse the web, handle email and work with unrestricted digital photo, video and music files. Some Linux distributions like Ubuntu (which has a guide to switching from Windows) and Linux Mint are popular and relatively user-friendly. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   What They Said: Rahul Gandhi’s Speech at Congress Executive Meeting. Advertisement   NEW DELHI – In an unusually passionate speech at the Indian National Congress’s national meeting on Friday, Rahul Gandhi praised the governing party as the defenders of the people’s will and criticized the main opposition as being undemocratic. Breaking from his usual calm demeanor, Mr. Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of “subverting democratic institutions” and “lighting the fires of communal hatred.” In an apparent jibe at Narendra Modi, the B.J.P.’s prime ministerial candidate, Mr. Gandhi said, “We do not respond by proposing either that the structures of democracy be handed over to one man or that they be viciously destroyed.” His speech came after the decision by his mother, Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, to keep to the party’s tradition of not naming a prime ministerial candidate before the elections. Instead, Mr. Gandhi, the Congress vice-president, will head the party’s campaign committee for the elections. As Mr. Gandhi stepped up to address hundreds of workers at the party’s one-day national executive meeting, he was greeted by a thundering clamor. However, even as shouts of “Rahul P.M.! Rahul P.M.!” went up, Mr. Gandhi, the scion of the powerful Gandhi family demurred. “It is written in the constitution that the prime minister is elected by the members of Parliament. We are a democratic party and we function in a democratic way,” said Mr. Gandhi. Here are some of the responses to Mr. Gandhi’s speech: Inder Malhotra, political commentator:  “His pitch was very fierce and high. Part of the purpose was because the Congress rank and file are very demoralized. They expect defeat in the elections. This is a kind of a pep talk for them, to say that there is a battle ahead but the battle is not lost. The second purpose is that though he is not officially designated as the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress Party, there is not the least bit of doubt that if the Congress Party is able to muster a narrow majority, the prime minister is Rahul Gandhi. If they do not, he can be the leader of opposition.” Neerja Chowdhury, senior journalist and political analyst:  “The speech was a different, more confident Rahul Gandhi, passionate, and he laid out a vision for the Congress Party. He gave an indication that he will now be in the lead. The Congress is now entering the Rahul phase; even the decision was made not to project him as the prime ministerial candidate for strategic reasons. There was a time when he had appeal for the younger generation, but somewhere he lost the plot on the way, and A.A.P. [Aam Aadmi Party] and Narendra Modi stepped into the vacuum in leadership. One reason he has not clicked is that he is an on-and-off politician. He would have an intensive phase of campaigning and engagement with the party, then he would disappear. Now he is saying he is here to stay, and if he really lives up to that, then it will remain to be seen how things change for Congress. What he was doing today at the A.I.C.C. [All India Congress Committee] session was to energize the worker of the Congress because it has been a very demotivated party of late.” Arun Jaitley, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha and senior B.J.P. leader, via Twitter:  “In 25 years, a Gandhi has not been the PM of this country. India, indeed, is changing. The Gandhis can control a party but not the nation.” Sanjay Kaul, B.J.P. Delhi spokesman:  “The Congress Party has known that Rahul Gandhi holds no capital anymore. Everyone is this country knows that. At no point has he looked as a leader. And by all estimates, the Congress is in no position to win the elections. The Gandhi family are not risk-takers and they do not lead from the front. They have used people as their props. The Congress Party has also been an exhibition for how they cut leaders to size in their respective states.” Girish Kuber, editor at Loksatta, a Marathi-language newspaper:  “He is playing to the typical ploy that every Indian politician employs, what has been called the politics of renunciation. He is taking the family tradition a step further because when Sonia Gandhi was sure that she will not get the chance to rule the country, she has talked about the inner voice. And now he is making these vague statements. Now the real issue is if Congress loses. This will be a real test for Rahul Gandhi. He will only emerge as a real leader in 2019. Projecting Rahul Gandhi as the prime minister did not make sense for the Congress. In fact, it helps Congress save Rahul for the real battle in 2019. That is Congress’s strategy.” Malavika Vyawahare contributed reporting. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Orange Is the New Green Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking. Orange is the color of the week in my kitchen, as it has been since the fall and will be throughout the winter at my farmers’ market. I’m making oven fries with sweet potatoes, roasting and simmering carrots and winter squash with seasonings I haven’t used before with these vegetables and finding new ways to enjoy grated carrot salads, which have always been a weakness of mine. Sometimes markets can look bleak in winter, but there’s nothing drab about carrots, sweet potatoes and winter squash; I’m finding that there is a lot I can do with these nutrient-dense vegetables. Nutrient-dense they are. In a recent study published by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, investigators looked at the relationship between cardiovascular disease and the colors of fruits and vegetables consumed. The question that the designers of the study were asking was whether the color of fruits and vegetables, which reflect the presence of bioactive compounds, can be associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Their conclusion was that a high intake of all four color groups — green, orange, red and white — and especially red and orange fruits and vegetables may be protective against cardiovascular disease. There is a lot that researchers are still uncovering about the compounds in orange vegetables. We do know that the pigments reflect the presence of beta-carotene, and not surprisingly, all three of these vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin A. They are very good to excellent sources of vitamins C and K, as well as very good sources of potassium and manganese. We know they are excellent sources of other phytonutrients that show some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, like lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene. And those are just the ones we are familiar with; there are plenty that are still under study in these delicious vegetables.

Sports   N.F.L. Conference Championship Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 17, 2014 Patriots at Broncos 3 p.m. Sunday, CBS Line: Broncos by 6 In Tom Brady’s first start in the N.F.L., he defeated Peyton Manning. Brady has continued to be a thorn in Manning’s side, compiling a sparkling 10-4 record (2-1 in the postseason) against him. The gesticulating Manning now leads the record-setting Denver offense, but like so many of his past teams, this one is overhyped because of a great offense masking a mediocre defense. It would be surprising for Brady to break a sweat about this game. One key to Brady’s confidence, other than his good looks, his large bank account, his Hall of Fame-worthy career and his supermodel wife, is the sudden emergence of a dominant New England running game. LeGarrette Blount, known mostly for ending his career at Oregon prematurely by punching an opponent, has become the type of runner that Patriots offenses have frequently lacked. In Week 17, the 6-foot, 250-pound Blount ran for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns against the overmatched Buffalo Bills. In a divisional playoff win over the Indianapolis Colts, Blount showed his success was no fluke, rushing for 166 yards and 4 touchdowns. He did not rush more than 14 times in a game until Week 16, but over the last three games he has averaged 6.7 yards a carry, gaining much of his yardage on hard runs between the tackles. That type of production, aided by a competent second running back in Stevan Ridley, takes the pressure off Brady, who was sacked 40 times this season. If given time to throw, Brady has shown he can work with the pint-size Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola as his main receiving threats. They may not make anyone forget the physicality of Rob Gronkowski, but they have consistently gotten the job done for New England. The last time Brady and Manning met for the A.F.C. championship, in the 2006 season, Manning and the Colts won in Indianapolis. Now Manning and the Broncos are favored because their offense has been loaded since Day 1 and the Patriots have had to cobble one together. Advertisement The game is in Denver, and New England has been a mediocre road team. In almost every way, it looks like a season to remember for Manning and one to forget for Brady. But Brady has been here before and relishes the chance to be an underdog. “I’m sure no one’s going to pick us to win,” Brady told reporters. He was wrong. Pick: Patriots   49ers at Seahawks 6:30 p.m. Sunday, Fox Line: Seahawks by 4 San Francisco’s NaVorro Bowman is a legitimate contender for defensive player of the year, and he can also find the essence of a game in a few words. “Long story short: They know us, we know them,” Bowman said of the rival Seahawks. “We got to go there. We all know the history. But this is the Super Bowl.” Either the Broncos or the Patriots will make an interesting Super Bowl opponent, but in a face-off reminiscent of the great 49ers-Cowboys postseason matchups of the early 1990s, the two most complete teams in the N.F.L. will be playing for the N.F.C. championship. The similarities between the 49ers and Seahawks have been noted time and again: bruising running backs, suffocating defenses, brash head coaches. Recent history has favored whichever team is at home. With that in mind, playing in Seattle is a large hurdle for San Francisco to overcome. In their last two meetings there, the Seahawks have beaten the 49ers by a combined score of 71-16. San Francisco has come a long way since a Week 2 thrashing by the Seahawks. The 49ers closed the regular season with six consecutive wins before winning two road games in the playoffs. Finally playing at full strength, with receiver Michael Crabtree showing that he was the missing piece of the puzzle, the 49ers are undoubtedly eager to change their luck in Seattle. Advertisement The main question mark will be Colin Kaepernick’s ability to manage the game at the line of scrimmage. With a remarkable combination of size, strength and quickness, Kaepernick can be among the game’s most dangerous players. But he continually runs the play clock down while making adjustments, regularly burning timeouts or incurring delay-of-game penalties. That problem grows worse in Seattle, where the fans are extremely loud and know when to raise the noise level. The N.F.L. rules do not protect read-option quarterbacks the way they do drop-back passers, so the odds are that neither Kaepernick nor his Seahawks counterpart Russell Wilson will do as much damage on the ground as they did in last year’s playoffs. With all other things being equal, as they seem to be, Kaepernick’s problems in getting plays off could prove to be the difference in the game. Pick: Seahawks Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line. A version of this article appears in print on January 19, 2014, on page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: N.F.L. Conference Championship Matchups.

U.S.   Obama’s Changes to Government Surveillance. Advertisement Advertisement By JOSH KELLER, ALICIA PARLAPIANO, DAVID E. SANGER and CHARLIE SAVAGE JAN. 17, 2014 President Obama announced on Friday that he will place new limits on intelligence agencies’ bulk collection of phone call records. But he rejected some other recommendations to rein in surveillance made by a panel of outside advisers. Related Article Documents released in June reveal that the N.S.A. has been systematically collecting logs of every Americans’ phone calls and storing the data for five years. Agency analysts may examine call records of people up to three links (or “hops”) removed from any number for which they decide there is “reasonable, articulable suspicion” of ties to terrorism. Mr. Obama says he wants to find a way not to have the government collect records in bulk, but rather keep them in private hands. In the meantime, analysts will now be able to examine only records of people two hops away from a suspect number. And the N.S.A. must obtain a court order ahead of time from a judge who agrees that the standard of suspicion has been met, with an exception for after-the-fact court review in a fast-moving exigency. There are two options for doing this. One is to require each telecommunications provider to retain its customers’ calling records for a certain time and store the data in a way that the government could quickly get access it – and cross-reference it with other providers’ records. The other is to create a private consortium that would comingle the records. Mr. Obama says there are difficulties with both options, and has directed his administration to study options and work with Congress to come up with a solution. Mr. Obama has rejected the idea of scrapping the program entirely, as some lawmakers and civil libertarians have called for, saying he wants to retain its capabilities but restructure it to reduce the possibility of abuses. Aides said Mr. Obama would like to get the N.S.A. out of the business of holding the data at all, so it was deemed to make little sense to order the agency to purge the data more quickly. That leaves open the question of how long telecommunications providers or a consortium would be required to retain the records. Mr. Obama said he would ask the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to come up with ideas for additional restrictions on government’s ability to retain, search and use the communications of Americans that were “incidentally” collected without a warrant. National Security Letters are subpoenas the F.B.I. can use to compel businesses to turn over a range of records about their customers, like financial transactions or data on communications, while gagging the recipients from talking about them. The F.B.I. uses the device tens of thousands of times a year, and it objected to losing the power to issues them unless a court approved. Mr. Obama rejected the recommendation to impose a court approval requirement. But he is ending the open-ended secrecy, saying the gag orders will expire after a fixed period in most cases. And he said providers would be allowed to say more to the public about the scope and scale of the orders they receive. Disclosures that the N.S.A. has been eavesdropping on foreign leaders, including the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, led to a diplomatic crisis for the Obama administration in October. Mr. Obama said he would generally ban the practice for “close friends and allies” and a senior administration official said this list included “dozens” of leaders of foreign countries, without specifying them. The administration did not address whether the U.S. would spy on other top officials from those countries. Recent disclosures revealed that the N.S.A. collects vast amounts of information from overseas telecommunications networks, vacuuming up metadata in bulk and intercepting the contents of communications. Mr. Obama said that new safeguards would limit the duration that the government can hold personal information about foreigners and restrict its use. While he acknowledged the United State’s responsibility to ask “tough questions” about its technological capabilities, he made clear that foreigners overseas do not enjoy the same protections as U.S. citizens. “This is not unique to America,” he said. “Few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders.” A senior official said the advocates would be called on only in cases presenting novel and important privacy law issues. The panel would apparently not have the authority to monitor the court’s caseload and independently decide when a case warranted its presence. Currently, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., selects all the judges who serve a term of extra duty on the secret court, and he has used that power to overwhelmingly pick Republican-appointed judges. Critics have called for diversifying the court by having other Supreme Court justices, or the chief judges of the appeals courts, play a role. Administration officials said that Mr. Obama would accept that kind of a change if Congress made it. In July, The New York Times reported that the N.S.A. had been collecting previously undiscovered “zero day” flaws in common computer programs and using them for mounting cyberattacks. White House says the recommendation is now under review by the security council to “review and, as necessary, adjust existing processes.’’ Documents released in September revealed that the agency had been working to weaken encryption standards so it could more easily crack secure systems. White House says its cybersecurity and science and technology offices are reviewing the issues and “we support the recommendation’s aim to protect the standards for commercial encryption.’’ In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates combined into one position the heads of the N.S.A., which is responsible for gathering intelligence, and the Cyber Command, the military's cyberwarfare unit. Mr. Obama has already rejected the recommendation to split command of the N.S.A. from the Cyber Command. The public debate over the scope of N.S.A. surveillance started when a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward J. Snowden, secretly made copies of four hard drives worth of top-secret documents and then leaked them. While Mr. Obama acknowledged Mr. Snowden’s role in starting the debate over privacy and national security, he did not address recommendations to secure classified information.
Business   ‘Bachelor’ Star’s Comments on Gays Spark Uproar. Advertisement Advertisement By BILL CARTERJAN. 18, 2014 PASADENA, Calif. — ABC faced a potential crisis on Saturday over one of its longest-running hits when a storm erupted here over homophobic comments made by the star of the reality series “The Bachelor.” In an interview at a press party, Juan Pablo Galavis, the latest bachelor tasked with picking a possible mate from among a cast of 25 beautiful women, told the editor of the website The TV Page that he was opposed to the idea of ABC producing a season of the show with a gay bachelor. Among other reasons, he said, “I don’t think it is a good example for kids to watch that on TV.” Of gay relationships, he added, “They are more pervert, in a sense.” (Mr. Galavis’s primary language is Spanish.) Mr. Galavis was among a gaggle of ABC stars who turned up for some informal conversations with reporters over cocktails Friday night at a semiannual gathering of the Television Critics Association. He spoke with Sean Daly, the editor of The TV Page, who asked for his opinion on a gay version of the popular reality series. Mr. Daly posted a recording of the interview on his site. The reaction to Mr. Galavis’s remarks was quick and intensely critical, with numerous reporters and commenters on Twitter denouncing them both as insensitive and, especially, inappropriate, given that Mr. Galavis is participating in a show that compels him to engage in romantic encounters with multiple women over a period of several weeks. ABC and the studio that produces “The Bachelor,” Warner Brothers, issued a statement on Saturday, saying, “Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio.” Mr. Galavis posted an apology on his Facebook page on Saturday. “I want to apologize to all the people I may have offended because of my comments,” he wrote. He went on to say that “I have many gay friends, and one of my closest friends, who’s like a brother, has been a constant in my life, especially during the past five months. The word ‘pervert’ was not what I meant to say, and I am very sorry about it. Everyone knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself.” Advertisement There was no mention by ABC or Warner Brothers of consequences, either for Mr. Galavis or the show. That may be because the show has ticked up in the ratings this season, with the show’s female fan base apparently smitten with Mr. Galavis, a single father and former Venezuelan soccer player. (As has been the program’s recent practice, Mr. Galavis is a former suitor on the “Bachelorette” version of the show. He was not the star’s final selection, but he warmed enough female hearts to be selected as the star of a season of “The Bachelor.”) So far this season, the show’s ratings have been up sharply from the same weeks last year. The premiere hit 8.7 million viewers, up from 6.9 million in 2013. It was a three-year high for the 12-year-old reality series. Mr. Galavis’s interview immediately sparked comparisons to the recent blowup over comments made by Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the family at the center of the A&E hit series “Duck Dynasty.” In that instance, the network reacted to what it perceived as homophobic comments by putting Mr. Robertson on indefinite suspension from the show, and then reinstated him after the show’s fans, along with some prominent conservative political voices, attacked the network for what they claimed was an assault on Mr. Robertson’s right to free speech. In the past, “The Bachelor” has openly courted — and even invented — its own controversies to drive ratings. This one seemed unexpected and spontaneous, however. ABC will undoubtedly watch closely to see how the show’s ratings are affected when it is back on the air Monday night. When “Duck Dynasty” returned this week after its own controversy, its ratings were down 28 percent. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   Turkey Extends Purge of Officials. Advertisement Advertisement By REUTERSJAN. 18, 2014 ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey has extended a purge of official institutions to the banking and telecoms regulators and state television, firing dozens of executives in moves that appear to broaden Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s response to a corruption investigation. Thousands of police officers, dozens of prosecutors and some state television officials have already been fired by Mr. Erdogan’s government, which is facing its biggest challenge with the corruption investigation. Investigators are believed to have been looking into allegations of corruption at a state-run bank and bribery involving real estate projects. Mr. Erdogan says the investigations are part of an attempted “judicial coup.” His opponents say that the purges are threatening the independence of the judiciary, the police and the media.

Sports   Serena Williams Tumbles in Australian Open’s Fourth Round. Advertisement Advertisement By GREG BISHOPJAN. 19, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — For almost a year, Serena Williams won professional tennis matches at an improbable 96 percent clip. Since her exit from the 2013 Australian Open, she had played 80 matches and had won 77 of them. As her fourth-round contest in this Australian Open wore on, though, Williams looked less and less like the most dominant player in women’s tennis. She was undone by a flurry of botched backhands, back pain and an opponent, Ana Ivanovic, who played more like a current world No. 1 than a former world No. 1. The crowd, squarely against Williams, rose to its feet and roared at the biggest upset so far in this tournament when the match ended with Ivanovic in front, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Williams smiled as she shook her opponent’s hand. Ivanovic had never beaten her — until Sunday. “It’s amazing,” Ivanovic said in her television interview on court. “I just played really well.” Over the first week of the Australian Open, Williams had accumulated records. She set the mark for most match wins in women’s singles at this tournament (61) and most women’s singles matches played (70). Advertisement All the while, she sought an even bigger milestone: an 18th Grand Slam singles championship. That would have put Williams in rare company, tied with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second-most in history, within sight of Steffi Graf and her historic 22 titles. Instead, other numbers surfaced in defeat. Like this one: In a career filled with Grand Slam tournaments, Williams had won the first set and still lost five times in a career that started in 1995. “I made a tremendous amount of errors,” Williams said at her post-match news conference. “Shots I missed that I normally don’t miss.” Williams tried to play down her physical problems, and said she wouldn’t make excuses. However, she added: “I obviously wasn’t hitting the way I normally would hit. Or moving the way I normally would move. I know for a fact I can play so much better than what I did today. I’m not disappointed in anything. I just know I can play ten times better than I played today.” Williams cruised through the first three rounds of this Australian Open behind a succession of swift victories in which she did not drop a set. She blew off one scheduled on-court interview after her third-round victory and offered an oblique explanation that she was busy and other tasks awaited. She confirmed after Sunday’s match that she was having back pain. Whatever the reason, she looked off on Sunday, even as she fought through and took the first set. She did not bend well on the backhand side, and she did not move well, and after she missed a return early in the second set, she bent over in apparent pain. Ivanovic capitalized. Since she won the French Open in 2008, Ivanovic had mostly disappointed. Her last run to a Grand Slam quarterfinal came at the United States Open in 2012. On Sunday, she blitzed Williams from the baseline, matched Williams for serve efficiency and showcased a varied game that kept Williams on the defensive more than usual. Ivanovic dictated how the match unfolded. Advertisement On the big points that Williams won, she often screamed loudly or pumped her fist emphatically, almost as if she was trying to get herself into the match. She stole repeated glances at her box and walked gingerly between points. Williams said she almost pulled out, adding, “I mean, I probably should have.” She gave credit to Ivanovic and said: “It’s not like I gave her the match. I tried to fight the best I could today.” With Williams’s defeat, which ended a 25-match winning streak, the women’s singles draw has opened significantly. Ivanovic, seeded 14th, joined Li Na (4) and Flavia Pennetta (28) as Sunday winners now into the quarterfinals. Li, a two-time finalist, needed only 59 minutes to register a 6-2, 6-0 win over Ekaterina Makarova. Li broke No. 22 Marakova’s serve five times. In the next round, Li will play Pennetta, who beat No. 9 Angelique Kerber, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5.

Travel   Restaurant Report: Oaxen Krog & Slip in Stockholm. Advertisement Advertisement By ALEXANDER LOBRANOJAN. 17, 2014 Though Copenhagen gets most of the regional limelight, Stockholm has quietly emerged as a gastronomic destination on par with the Danish capital. One of the strongest sets of players in that mix is the chef Magnus Ek and his wife, Agneta Green, who closed Oaxen, the restaurant they’d founded in 1994 on its namesake island in the southern part of the Stockholm archipelago, and moved to a striking new water’s-edge location on Djurgarden, an island in central Stockholm, last May. Here Mr. Ek’s cuisine — an indigenous gastronomic style based on witty modern riffs on the country’s own taste palate, showcasing its best local produce — is parsed out in two different settings. At Oaxen Krog, the chef serves ambitious six- and 10-course tasting menus, while Oaxen Slip, his casual-dining restaurant next door, offers dishes like deep-fried herring with herb vinegar. “Oaxen Slip is about having a good time with friends in an easygoing environment, while at Oaxen Krog the food is intended to be the focus of the experience,” Mr. Ek said. The two restaurants have big picture windows surrounded by an industrial but well-groomed décor that intentionally nods at the former shipyard that occupied the site. These simple visuals serve as a preview to Mr. Ek’s cooking philosophy at Krog, which intends to quietly exalt his ingredients through a posture of gastronomic humility. Still, the first course of a recent 10-course tasting menu stunned with a composition suggesting the cool drama of an Ingmar Bergman film. Oysters with curds of soured milk and kohlrabi in soured whey had all of the jarring complexity of a troubled but passionate relationship. The meal tacked back to a Swedish wholesomeness with a single plump flash-fried langoustine in a cream of fermented button mushrooms with sour cream and dill. Not every dish worked — spider crab cooked with bladderwrack, a seaweed, in a seafood sauce seemed overwrought — but yogurt-roasted cod cheeks with oak moss, seaweed, cockles and black garlic cream had a haiku-like perfection. Those seafood dishes were generally more interesting than Mr. Ek’s meat ones, though a heather-roasted saddle of lamb with pickled chives, warm lamb lard and puréed leeks had an alluring rustic elegance. An article last Sunday about Oaxen Krog & Slip in Stockholm misstated the given name of the chef and owner there. He is Magnus Ek, not Markus Ek. Oaxen Krog & Slip, Beckholmsvagen 26; 46-8-551-53105; oaxen.com. Six-course menu, 1,650 kroner ($250 at 6.55 kroner to the dollar); 10-course menu, 1,950 kroner.

Business   More Monster and Hats. Advertisement Our challenge this week was suggested by Chris Roat, who calls it “one of my favorite puzzles of the year.” And Dr. Roat sees a lot of puzzles — he’s an active participant in Bay Area puzzle competitions and a longtime Google employee currently up to something top-secret at Google X. His suggestion for this week is a continuation of our recent Andrew Luck Monster Problem. Put on your headgear and get ready for — More Monster and Hats Two people find themselves stuck on a remote island. One day, a terrible monster appears. The monster says that he intends to eat the pair, but will give them the following chance to survive: Later that day, the monster will line them up face-to-face. The monster will then place either a black or white hat on each person’s head. Each person can see the hat on his or her counterpart, but cannot see his or her own hat. The monster will then ask both people at once to simultaneously guess the color of his or her own hat. The person can say only one word — either “white” or “black.” If both people are wrong, the monster will devour them on the spot; Otherwise they can go free. The two people have all afternoon to plan their strategy. The question is — what should they do? That’s it for the puzzle this week. If you’re looking for Gary Hewitt’s Enhancer to optimize your Numberplay experience, please be patient — Mr. Hewitt is revamping the tool to support The Times’s new blog format. Finally, do send your favorite hat-and-monster puzzle to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com. Solution    As some discovered, the game is 100% solvable – no randomization/guessing is needed to increase the odds of winning. It’s true even for the n colors, n people generalization. And as Daniel Finkel alludes to in the 2-hat case, the rock-solid strategy will lead to exactly one person guessing correctly. In the two-hat case, it’s easiest to explain to people that either the hats are the “same” or “different.” I find that is the paradigm shift people will have trouble with. Then the solution is deciding which of the two players will guess “same” and which will guess “different,” based on what they see. The astonishing solution, then, is to have one person always call out whatever color hat they see on the other person’s head, and that other person call out the opposite color of what they see. This will, incredibly, always allow one person to guess his or her own hat color correctly, and thereby saving both from being devoured by the terrible monster.

Foreign   Aam Aadmi Protest Shuts Down Central Delhi. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — The heart of India’s capital came to a standstill on Monday after Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, and members of his Aam Aadmi Party squared off with the central government in a public demonstration to demand that the Delhi police should be under state, not federal, control. As Delhi police officers barricaded the roads in central Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal also called on all residents to join him in a 10-day protest against the Delhi Police Department for failing to protect women. In a speech, he contended that the state government would be better at running the city’s police force, which he criticized as corrupt and inefficient under the central government’s administration. The standoff began early on Monday when seven lawmakers from the Aam Aadmi, or Common Man, Party, led by Mr. Kejriwal, headed out to the Home Ministry, which oversees the Delhi police, to demand the resignations of three station house officers who they said had failed to protect women in three reported cases: a gang rape of a Danish tourist, the burning of a woman over a lack of dowry and an alleged prostitution racket. However, they were prevented by the Delhi police from staging a protest in front of the ministry. The ministry, headed by Sushil Kumar Shinde, had issued a prohibitory order against the demonstration, citing a law that forbids the gathering of more than five people. The Delhi police shut down four subway stops in central Delhi and set up barricades to seal off the North Block, which houses the Home Ministry and other government offices nearby. Chaotic scenes played out as a heavy contingent of police officials surrounded Mr. Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi ministers and kept them at the railway building, known as Rail Bhavan. When the Aam Aadmi leaders realized they would not be allowed to reach the Home Ministry, Mr. Kejriwal decided to urge the public to join him at Rail Bhavan to demand that the central government hand over control of the Delhi police to the state government. In a speech, he accused Mr. Shinde of being corrupt and called on the “honest” police officials to take off their uniforms and join the side of the common man. The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Delhi police of allowing a drug and prostitution ring allegedly run by four Ugandan woman to fester. Last week, the state’s law minister, Somnath Bharti of Aam Aadmi, demanded that the police arrest the four women during a midnight raid on their house, but the officers refused, citing the lack of a warrant and a lack of evidence. “No sex or drug racket can take place without complicity of police,” Mr. Kejriwal said. While women’s rights activists and political opponents have accused Mr. Bharti of racism, his party has backed his actions. On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal held up a letter he said was from the Uganda High Commission, stating that several girls from Uganda being brought into India on the promise of work and education were being trafficked. But Syed Akbaruddin, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman, said the Uganda High Commission denied sending any such letter. So far, the central government has refused to meet any of Mr. Kejriwal’s demands. Mr. Shinde said Monday that action would only be taken after a judicial inquiry against the three police officers was completed. He also said that security of the capital was too vital to be delegated to the Delhi government. Maxwell Pereira, former joint police commissioner in Delhi, said the chaos and sheer numbers of the Aam Aadmi demonstration were a security threat to the capital, especially in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan. 26. He also said that the chief minister was himself breaking the law by staging the protest, which has been prohibited. Mr. Kejriwal’s criticism of Mr. Shinde has put the Aam Aadmi’s coalition partner in the state government, the Congress Party, in an awkward position because the home minister is a Congress member. But though it opposed the Aam Aadmi rally, the Congress Party said Monday that it would not withdraw its support to the party. Mr. Kejriwal’s political rivals immediately criticized the Aam Aadmi Party for the disruption to the city, saying that Mr. Kejriwal should act like a statesman and stop shouting on the streets as he did when he was an anticorruption activist. “Did the AAP form a government to wreck the system from within?” Arun Jaitley, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said on Twitter, referring to Aam Aadmi. Responding to critics who called him an anarchist, Mr. Kejriwal said, “Yes, I am. Today, I will spread anarchy in the house of Mr. Shinde, the same way he has spread anarchy in our households.” The closure of the subway stations inconvenienced commuters in the morning, and the road closures snarled city traffic at night. Sibi Arasu, 26, who had been unaware of the subway closures, said it was annoying to look for alternative modes of transportation in the morning. Mr. Arasu, a media professional, said he was 20 minutes late after taking an auto-rickshaw for 40 rupees, or 65 U.S. cents,one way — a cost that could get expensive if the protests continued for 10 days, he said. In the afternoon, despite growing concerns of the Delhi police over security near government buildings, Mr. Kejriwal refused to move the protest to another location. By late afternoon, the number of Aam Aadmi members began to swell, and some began scuffling with Delhi police officers, whose numbers were also growing.The party said in a statement said that the state transport minister, Saurabh Bhardwaj, was detained and another lawmaker, Akhilesh Tripathi, was beaten up. By evening, even as it was getting colder and darker, the crowds were growing at Rail Bhavan, many to support Aam Aadmi, but about 20 were there to protest Mr. Bharti’s treatment of the Ugandan women. And as people got ready to return home from work, the city was struck by long traffic jams, prompting many taxi and auto-rickshaw passengers to get out and walk to their destinations. By 10 p.m., Mr. Kejriwal was still sitting outside Rail Bhavan, surrounded by his supporters. Betwa Sharma is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.

Science   A Taste of My Own Manners Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Dr. Perri Klass on family health. When I started my internship, in 1986, I was given a beeper, which was handed over with a certain sense of ceremony and a certain yoke of obligation. Before cellphones were omnipresent, the beeper was a badge of professional importance: I’m a doctor — life and death depend on my instant availability. If you were talking to a patient and your beeper went off, it was understood to be a medical summons; you were entitled — and expected — to step out of the room and answer. As I went through residency and began practicing, I would never have thought of silencing my beeper when I was seeing a patient, even though I was often paged about things that were not of immediate life-or-death importance. (“Mom, I couldn’t find my social studies project this morning. Did you put it somewhere?”) Nowadays, every patient I see is just as reachable in the exam room as I am, and my reactions to their behavior with their cellphones has made me question my own attitudes toward monitoring messages and tolerating interruptions. I asked Judith Martin, who writes the Miss Manners books and columns, what the etiquette considerations are here, and she let me know in no uncertain terms that doctors themselves traded on their greater prestige in the doctor-patient relationship to create a culture that allowed rudeness — and that rudeness is now being returned. “We are reaping the punishment of doctors having used these manners when patients could not,” she said. It’s not just doctors, of course; it’s a problem outside medical settings as well, she said, with “people keeping one another waiting, ignoring those who are present in favor of taking phone calls.” Now everyone has the equivalent of a beeper, and everyone answers because, after all, it might be an emergency. In the exam room, patients routinely take calls, or at least glance at their phones. And adolescents, needless to say, can go on texting even as they’re answering a doctor’s questions. Manners, morals and medicine intersect in the doctor’s office, in a quotidian interplay of patient imperatives and medical management, politeness and professionalism, patients and patience. What are the ethics of keeping one another waiting? “These issues are hugely important to patient satisfaction, to patient compliance, to patient trust, and to physician peace of mind, or a physician’s positive attitude about work and environment,” said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the bioethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center. “But ethicists spend almost no time thinking about them.” I am not a particularly patient patient, and recently, when I went with my mother to the eye doctor, I found myself getting pretty cranky in the waiting room. After all, we had made the first morning appointment, gotten ourselves out of bed and out into the cold and across town for a 7:30 time slot. Was it possible, I wondered irritably, that the doctor hadn’t even arrived yet? And I went back to the clinic desk to ask once again, in a polite but clearly provocative way, if they knew how much longer it would be. But here is my confession: That agonizing sense of the minutes ticking past, that outraged feeling of cosmic unfairness when an early appointment is not matched by a prompt consummation, it all falls away when I’m on the other side of that clinic desk. Later that very same day, getting ready for my next patient, it made complete sense to me that first I had to read through the child’s medical record on screen — and then, yes, check my messages quickly, and then stand in the hallway and speak to a colleague for a little while — all with the patient and her mother (and the next patient and his mother) sitting in the waiting room and, well, waiting. And keeping children waiting is even more inexcusable than keeping adults waiting; children are not suited for waiting. The truth is, I was in the doctor’s time zone. And I had a feeling of hard-working entitlement that coexisted remarkably easily with the very recent memory of my own sense of outrage at being made to wait. Later that day, while I was asking a 10-year-old girl some questions about her health, her mother’s cellphone rang, with one of those loud, intrusive musical ringtones. I was neither surprised nor outraged when the mother reached into her bag, pulled out the phone and started chatting. But I suspended my conversation with the child and stared questioningly at the mother until she said, “I can’t talk now, we’re with the doctor,” and hung up. But the calls to my phone, as important as they may be to me, are not actually life-or-death patient issues, and I, too, need to turn it off. Dr. Caplan pointed out that part of providing good and professional medical care is treating people properly: “How do I cement trust in this relationship? How do we show respect for one another in a health care relationship where respect is partially an intrinsic good but also important for securing cooperation, compliance, continuity of care?” Sometimes cementing trust and showing respect actually means sitting quietly while a parent takes a phone call and arranges, for example, the pickup that will get her home after that too-long wait in the exam room. Good manners, and good morals, actually depend on getting outside the doctor’s time zone and crossing over to where everyone else lives.

Sports   Ulster Gains Top Seeding in Heineken Cup Matches. Advertisement Advertisement By HUW RICHARDSJAN. 21, 2014 London — Ulster was the big winner on the sixth and last weekend of pool matches in the Heineken Cup, rugby union’s equivalent of soccer’s Champions League. With only two places still to be claimed, the weekend was mostly about settling the seeding order which determines the quarterfinal draw. The last eight includes involves six former champions. The two yet to win currently lead the English and French championships. Ulster, the only team to have made the playoffs for the last four years, completed a pool stage sweep and secured top seeding when it won, 22-19, away to English champion Leicester. It was Leicester’s first Heineken loss at home in 25 matches and more than seven years. Ulster was already through, but heading for a tough away quarterfinal when it trailed 19-9 with 24 minutes to go. The comeback was spearheaded by its South African scrum-half Ruan Pienaar, who scored all 22 points, including the decisive penalty with 11 minutes left. A home quarterfinal at its tightly atmospheric Ravenhill Road ground also brings the chance of revenge against English club Saracens, which beat it in the quarterfinal last year. Advertisement “It seems like it’s happening every week, when Ruan scores all the points — he was outstanding,” said Ulster’s captain Johann Muller, “We came here to get a home quarterfinal. Sarries totally outplayed us last season — they are a great side and don’t mind going away to get a result.” Leicester’s loser’s prize was one of the best runner-up spots and a fearsome quarterfinal at Clermont Auvergne. Saracens claimed the other runner-up place by beating Connacht, 64-6, at Aviva Park. Its 11-try hammering of the Irish province was highlighted by two English veterans — winger Dave Strettle crossed three times while playmaker Charlie Hodgson reprised the performances he formerly produced for England, prompting brilliantly in open play but missing a series of kicks at goal. Full-back Alec Goode, one of England’s newer generation, produced the best single moment with a double feint to either side followed by a 50-meter dash to score through the space his move created. “Alec has been outstanding for the last two months, but that’s as good as it gets,” said Saracens coach Mark McCall, who added that his team’s third consecutive qualification for the playoffs “makes us a top eight side, but the next step is to be in the top two or three.” The other team to seal qualification on the final weekend was three-time champion Leinster, which hammered Ospreys, 36-3, on Friday. The contest turned on the early sending off for stamping of Ospreys lock Ian Evans. A suspension will rule Evans — who has played in every match of Wales’s consecutive championship seasons — out of some or all of the European Six Nations championship, which begins on Feb. 1. Leinster must travel, to reigning champion Toulon, in the quarterfinal. Not so compatriot Munster, which demolished Edinburgh, 38-6, to ensure a home playoff. A qualifier for the 15th time in 16 years Munster will entertain four-time winner Toulouse a quarterfinal clash of the tournament’s perennial heavyweights. Toulouse blew its own chance of a home draw when it fell well short of a four-try bonus point, crossing only once as it won, 16-6, away to Italian scrappers Zebre. France’s captain Thierry Dusautoir tore a tendon in his biceps and will miss the Six Nations. Toulouse’s failure left the way open for the French clubs who contested last year’s final to seal home draws. Toulon won, 15-9, in foul conditions away to Glasgow, while Clermont clinched its 71st victory at Stade Marcel Michelin, beating Racing Metro, 28-3. Advertisement “It wasn’t pretty,” said Clermont’s Scottish international lock forward of his team’s struggle to claim a bonus point against opponents who had three players sin-binned for illegal play. “We need to be a bit more clinical if we’re going to go further” The consolation prizes of places in the quarterfinals of the second rank Amlin Trophy went to the English trio of Northampton, Gloucester — which won, 36-18, away to Perpignan — and Harlequins, whose outside-half Ben Botica kicked a late penalty to end Wales’s vestigial European presence by beating Scarlets, 22-20, in Llanelli. The draw was also made for the semifinals, in which home teams play in their own county, but not on their usual home ground. The winner of Ulster versus Saracens will have home country advantage over the winners of Clermont versus Leicester, while Toulon or Leinster enjoy that edge over Munster or Toulouse.

The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced last August that same-sex spouses who were legally married could jointly file federal tax returns as married couples for 2013 as well as amended returns for some previous years, possibly receiving thousands of dollars in refunds. The announcement came two months after the Supreme Court struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which prevented gay couples from receiving the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. The Times is seeking to talk to gay couples who are considering filing amended tax returns.

Science   How Inactivity Changes the Brain Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. A number of studies have shown that exercise can remodel the brain by prompting the creation of new brain cells and inducing other changes. Now it appears that inactivity, too, can remodel the brain, according to a notable new report. The study, which was conducted in rats but likely has implications for people too, the researchers say, found that being sedentary changes the shape of certain neurons in ways that significantly affect not just the brain but the heart as well. The findings may help to explain, in part, why a sedentary lifestyle is so bad for us. Until about 20 years ago, most scientists believed that the brain’s structure was fixed by adulthood, that you couldn’t create new brain cells, alter the shape of those that existed or in any other way change your mind physically after adolescence. But in the years since, neurological studies have established that the brain retains plasticity, or the capacity to be reshaped, throughout our lifetimes. Exercise appears to be particularly adept at remodeling the brain, studies showed. But little has been known about whether inactivity likewise alters the structure of the brain and, if so, what the consequences might be. So for a study recently published in The Journal of Comparative Neurology, scientists at Wayne State University School of Medicine and other institutions gathered a dozen rats. They settled half of them in cages with running wheels and let the animals run at will. Rats like running, and these animals were soon covering about three miles a day on their wheels. The other rats were housed in cages without wheels and remained sedentary. After almost three months of resting or running, the animals were injected with a special dye that colors certain neurons in the brain. In this case, the scientists wanted to mark neurons in the animals’ rostral ventrolateral medulla, an obscure portion of the brain that controls breathing and other unconscious activities central to our existence. The rostral ventrolateral medulla commands the body’s sympathetic nervous system, which among other things controls blood pressure on a minute-by-minute basis by altering blood-vessel constriction. Although most of the science related to the rostral ventrolateral medulla has been completed using animals, imaging studies in people suggest that we have the same brain region and it functions similarly. A well-regulated sympathetic nervous system correctly directs blood vessels to widen or contract as needed and blood to flow, so that you can, say, scurry away from a predator or rise from your office chair without fainting. But an overly responsive sympathetic nervous system is problematic, said Patrick Mueller, an associate professor of physiology at Wayne State University who oversaw the new study. Recent science shows that “overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to cardiovascular disease,” he said, by stimulating blood vessels to constrict too much, too little or too often, leading to high blood pressure and cardiovascular damage. The sympathetic nervous system will respond erratically and dangerously, scientists theorize, if it is receiving too many and possibly garbled messages from neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. And, as it turned out, when the scientists looked inside the brains of their rats after the animals had been active or sedentary for about 12 weeks, they found noticeable differences between the two groups in the shape of some of the neurons in that region of the brain. Using a computerized digitizing program to recreate the inside of the animals’ brains, the scientists established that the neurons in the brains of the running rats were still shaped much as they had been at the start of the study and were functioning normally. But many of the neurons in the brains of the sedentary rats had sprouted far more new tentacle-like arms known as branches. Branches connect healthy neurons into the nervous system. But these neurons now had more branches than normal neurons would have, making them more sensitive to stimuli and apt to zap scattershot messages into the nervous system. In effect, these neurons had changed in ways that made them likely to overstimulate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially increasing blood pressure and contributing to the development of heart disease. This finding is important because it adds to our understanding of how, at a cellular level, inactivity increases the risk of heart disease, Dr. Mueller said. But even more intriguing, the results underscore that inactivity can change the structure and functioning of the brain, just as activity does. Of course, rats are not people, and this is a small, short-term study. But already one takeaway is that not moving has wide-ranging physiological effects. In upcoming presentations, Dr. Mueller said, he plans to show slides of the different rat neurons and, echoing the old anti-drug message, point out that “‘this is your brain.’ And this is your brain on the couch.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/28/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: This Is Your Brain on the Couch.

Sports   Sharapova Follows Williams Out the Door. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN ROTHENBERGJAN. 20, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — One day after the heavy favorite Serena Williams lost to Ana Ivanovic, another multiple Grand Slam champion crashed out in the fourth round at the Australian Open. On Monday, Maria Sharapova, a four-time Grand Slam champion and the No. 3 seed, lost to No. 20 Dominika Cibulkova, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. For Cibulkova, it was a moment of exuberance. After shaking Sharapova’s hand, she bounced back toward her player box, leaping several times and pumping her fists. Cibulkova, of Slovakia, has never been ranked in the top 10, but her victory meant that she has now reached the quarterfinals at all four Grand Slam events. Though she lost the third set fairly easily, Sharapova had given herself a good chance to win the second after falling behind, 0-5, eventually digging back to 4-5 before missing several crucial returns of second serves that allowed Cibulkova to serve out the set on her third try. Advertisement After losing the second set, Sharapova walked off the court with a trainer and received an off-court medical timeout for what she later said was a hip strain. “I mean, those aches and pains are expected when you spend a long time on the court,” she said, though she later added that knowing how such pain would have affected her movements was not “rocket science.” Cibulkova said she did not see that Sharapova was visibly affected by the injury, and added that she thought Sharapova was trying to disrupt her momentum throughout the match. “I didn’t see during the rallies,” Cibulkova said. “She was running, and, I don’t know. Of course I knew that she took the medical timeout, but she was trying to change my rhythm a lot of times during the games.” It wasn’t the first time Cibulkova had beaten Sharapova at a Grand Slam, having previously routed her, 6-0, 6-2, in the quarterfinals of the 2009 French Open. “This is, I would say, the most important thing,” Cibulkova said. “I went on the court, and I was more than 100 percent sure that I really can beat her. I can beat her on the big court, in the important match, you know, on the Grand Slam. I did it before, and I knew she knows me.” Sharapova, who had to battle in extreme heat for three and a half hours Thursday to beat Karin Knapp, 3-6, 6-4, 10-8, in their second-round match, said her ability to escape with less than her best tennis had run out. Sharapova had been forced to miss the United States Open with a shoulder injury, and had only been able to play one tournament between August and the Australian Open. “I haven’t been playing the best tennis of this tournament, but I found ways to get through to the last two matches,” she said. “I tried to do that again today, but she played extremely well.” Advertisement Cibulkova’s next opponent will be No. 11 Simona Halep. The Romanian won a marathon game at the start of the third set and eventually ran away with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-0 victory over No. 8 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. Halep, who began 2013 ranked 47th, won six titles last year, second only to the 11 won by Serena Williams. Later on Monday afternoon, in a rematch of last year’s controversy-tinged semifinal, Victoria Azarenka was rarely threatened by Sloane Stephens, beating the last American left in the tournament, 6-3, 6-2. Azarenka dominated the match from the start while Stephens struggled with consistency, and too often was not proactive enough to dictate rallies with her superior power. While both players struck 20 winners in the match, Stephens had 32 winners to 20 by Azarenka, a Belarussian. Stephens, who was defending a large number of ranking points she gained from reaching the semifinals last year, will slip from 13th to somewhere around 17th. While not as eyebrow-raising as the finish to last year’s match, which was marred by Azarenka’s taking a lengthy medical timeout after her lead in the second set began to slip away, there was little love lost between the two. Late in the first set, Azarenka pulled Stephens in toward the net with a drop shot, and Stephens landed a hard backhand passing shot between Azarenka’s legs. Three points later, after hitting another drop shot that pulled Stephens forward, Azarenka responded with a head-high reflex volley that narrowly missed Stephens, leaving the American smiling broadly as she mimed applause with her racket. Stephens, who said she had “never hit anyone in a match,” denied intentionally aiming for her opponent. “I thought she was going to move and she didn’t,” Stephens said. “I don’t know what was happening, but didn’t think that would ever happen.” Azarenka also played down the moment. “Maybe she had an open court, but she chose that shot,” she said of Stephens. “I have no problem with that.” Advertisement Azarenka, the second seed and two-time defending champion, most likely emerges as the favorite to win the tournament once again with Williams and Sharapova out of contention. “I don’t consider myself just a favorite because I don’t consider anybody as the favorite,” Azarenka said. “I just go out there and play my best, because anybody, on any given day — we’ve seen that happen last couple days — can bring their best game. You have to stay alert. It doesn’t matter the level that you’re No. 2 or whatever. Everybody has proven that anybody can beat anybody.” In the quarterfinals, Azarenka, will face Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, who defeated Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain, 6-1, 6-3.

Business   New Security Report Confirms Everyone Is Spying on Everyone. Advertisement Lest we forget, the National Security Agency is in good company. A new security report confirms that Chinese hackers spied on The New York Times in 2012, as well as attendees of the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg last fall. Iranian hackers spied on dissidents in the lead up to state elections last May. The Syrian Electronic Army is only getting better, and North Korean hackers were behind a destructive cyberattack that wiped data from South Korean banks last year. These were just some of the findings of CrowdStrike, the hot Laguna Niguel, Calif., security start-up which tracked more than 50 hacking groups last year. The company, started by George Kurtz, the antivirus company McAfee’s former chief technology officer, and Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee’s former vice president of threat research, produced its findings in an annual report Wednesday. The report buttresses previous findings by The New York Times, Google and a number of other security firms, including FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif.-based security software firm that acquired Mandiant last year. It also offered a number of interesting new discoveries. Among them: Needless to say, this won’t be a slow year for the $67 billion cybersecurity industry. Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   A Race Against Time for a Second Child. Advertisement Updated, 9:27 a.m. | At 39, Xiao Cai knows time is not on her side if she’s to fulfill her yearning and have a sibling for her 3-year-old son. Her dreams are modest; she only wants two children. Yet two months after the Chinese government announced a change to the one-child policy to permit some families a second child (the change will apply to couples where one partner is an only child), hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of women like Xiao Cai who are pushing the limit of their fertility find themselves in a bizarre and painful situation: Their dream of having two could be defeated at the finish line by the slow-turning wheels of state bureaucracy. After decades of the one-child policy, many Chinese still feel that two children is a more normal number than one. Xiao Cai, who asked to be identified only by her nickname to maintain her privacy, hopes deeply for a girl. A family of one girl and one boy — known in the West as a ‘‘millionaire’s family’’ — is an ideal here, too, like the two vases that make up the pair in traditional Chinese aesthetics. She knows that her biological clock is ticking fast. But only in Zhejiang Province and, today, in Anhui Province, has the policy become law. In mid-January, the provincial People’s Congress in Zhejiang revised the law to permit qualifying couples to apply to have a second, saying the law ‘‘has been born,’’ according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. In Beijing, Liu Zhi, the city’s head of family planning, said officials ‘‘hope’’ to implement the change there on Mar. 1, The Beijing News reported. ‘‘The authorities have said they will change the law, but no one knows for sure when,’’ said Xiao Cai, a Beijinger and a health care worker. For now, she can only wait, as she has done since November. ‘‘I really want another baby,’’ she said. ‘‘But if we try now, what if I get pregnant and the law doesn’t change in time?’’ ‘‘I’d like to just go ahead. But if it doesn’t happen soon and I have a child, it could have really severe consequences for us,’’ she said. ‘‘If I don’t do it now, I may never be able to. I really don’t know what to do.’’ The financial consequences of breaking the law, even in its dying days, would be heavy. She has done her math: the couple could be fined 300,000 renminbi, about $50,000. It would financially ruin them. Her husband left his ‘‘iron rice bowl’’ state job some years ago to work independently. Their income is adequate, but they’re not rich. In a later text message, she wrote: ‘‘I’ve read in the newspapers that the whole country is researching this, when and how to bring it in. And I’ve read other stories that say the government is saying, don’t rush to have a second child, you must wait for the central government to announce it’s for real, or you will have problems getting all the papers you need.’’ So for now, she anxiously waits. Xiao Cai is luckier than many of her friends who she said are battling infertility, a condition she believes is growing in China, based on anecdotal evidence. She already has her son. Yet she also has an older sister with whom she is extremely close and she cherishes that sibling love. What mostly drives her, she said, was the fear that her son would feel alone. ‘‘Only one child, isn’t it lonely for him? He’s so clingy. I think it would be really good for him to have a sibling,’’ she said. So, as has been the case since 1979, when the one-child policy began, Chinese remain dependent on the will of the state for that most intimate of things: procreation. Only now, for many it’s a race against time. The government expects between one million and two million additional births per year after the law takes effect countrywide, said Mao Qun’an, a spokesperson for the National Health and Family Planning Commission. In Beijing, officials expect between 30,000 and 50,000 more births per year, The Beijing News wrote. Xiao Cai is hoping her dreamed-of daughter will be one of them — if the law changes before her fertility runs out.

Science   Potato and Sorrel Gratin. Advertisement Advertisement Recipes for Health By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN JAN. 20, 2014 When a friend offered me sorrel from her garden I accepted gladly. I love the tangy flavor of this green leafy vegetable and will always buy it if I see it in my farmers’ market. You don’t need much to contribute lots of lemony flavor and vitamins C, A, iron, calcium and magnesium. The gratin is not a typical creamy sliced potato gratin; it’s more like a potato pie. I cook the potatoes first, then slice or dice and toss with the wilted sorrel, eggs, milk and cheese. Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes 2 pounds small or medium-size Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed Salt to taste 8 ounces sorrel, stemmed and washed in 2 changes of water 1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in half Olive oil or butter for the baking dish 4 eggs 1 1/2 cups milk (2 percent) 3 ounces Gruyère, grated (3/4 cup) 1 ounce Parmesan, grated (1/4 cup) Freshly ground pepper 1. Place potatoes in a wide saucepan and cover with water. Add salt to taste and bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover partially and gently boil potatoes for 20 minutes, or until tender all the way through but firm enough to slice. Drain, return the potatoes to the pan, cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Remove from the pot and using a towel to grip the potatoes if they are too hot to handle, slice about 1/2 inch thick, or if you prefer, cut in dice. Transfer to a large bowl. Advertisement 2. Meanwhile stem and wash sorrel leaves. Heat a wide skillet over high heat and add the sorrel, in batches if necessary. Stir until sorrel has wilted in the liquid left on the leaves after washing. The color will go from bright green to drab olive and the sorrel will melt down to what looks like a purée. Don’t worry, it will be chopped and mixed with the other ingredients and you won’t mind the color. When all of the sorrel has wilted, remove from heat and transfer to a strainer or a colander. Rinse briefly with cold water, then press or squeeze out excess liquid. Chop medium-fine. Transfer to bowl with the potatoes, toss together and season with salt and pepper. 3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rub sides and bottom of a 2- to 2 1/2-quart baking dish or gratin with the cut side of the garlic clove. Oil dish with olive oil. Mince remaining garlic and add to potatoes and sorrel. 4. Beat eggs in a medium bowl. Add salt to taste (I use about 1/2 teaspoon). Whisk in milk. Add to potatoes and sorrel and stir well to distribute sorrel evenly throughout the mixture. Stir in cheeses and freshly ground pepper, and scrape into the baking dish. 5. Bake 45 minutes, or until set and the top and sides are nicely browned. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for 10 minutes or longer before serving. Yield: Serves 6 to 8 Advance preparation: You can cook the potatoes and sorrel up to a day ahead. The gratin keeps well in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Reheat in a medium oven for about 20 minutes.

Business   IBM Happy to Be Rid of Low-End Server Business. Advertisement   Lenovo of China, already the world’s largest maker of personal computers, has purchased from IBM one of the world’s largest computer server businesses, for what seems like a rock-bottom price. Lenovo gets market share in an area where it is a small player. IBM is shedding a business that was killing its profitability in higher-margin software and services. Wish both sides luck. What seems something like the proverbial win-win deal is more likely a sign of how fast things are changing in the trillion-dollar global technology industry. Businesses like PCs are losing ground to mobile devices like smartphones, and the once-formidable computer server is increasingly viewed as one more commodity piece of globe-spanning cloud computing projects from a few elite players. “We need to get an inventor’s profit, not a distributor’s profit,” said Steve Mills, senior vice president of software and systems at IBM. “Our investment in research and development is what makes IBM go. It’s hard to do that in markets that don’t give you credit for the innovations you bring.” It’s stark how quickly that margin fell away. A year ago, IBM was talking about a sale of its server business to Lenovo for what was reported at the time to be $6 billion. Today’s deal for $2.3 billion kept for IBM some higher-value servers, like those that perform complex data analytics. But according to Mr. Mills, it also included agreements for IBM to buy from Lenovo some of the commodity, or x86, servers for IBM’s growing cloud business. About 7,500 IBM employees, including people in sales, marketing and customer support, will also move to Lenovo as part of the deal, Mr. Mills said. He also noted that IBM still spends $6 billion a year in research and development, from which it plans to create higher-value businesses. “The money has to go where the market goes: Social, mobile, analytics, and security,” he said. “We’ve put a lot of money there, tens of billions just buying analytics companies over the past several years. You’ll still see us doing a lot of creative things in hardware.” For its part, Lenovo moves from near invisibility in the server market to a crucial position. According to Gartner, in the third quarter of 2013 Lenovo’s global server presence was about 0.2 percent of the 2.4 million x86 servers shipped worldwide. IBM had a 7.5 percent share. Hewlett-Packard was first, with a 26.8 percent share, and Dell came second, with a 19.6 percent share. “Even in China, Lenovo has only a 10-percent share,” said Errol Rasit, an analyst with Gartner. “IBM has 11 percent. There isn’t much more efficiency Lenovo can put into the manufacture, H.P. and Dell have already been about as efficient as possible. Lenovo bought entrance into an extremely challenging market that is in transition.” Investors seem to think Lenovo’s jump into a sizable share of the market will have an effect on pricing, however. Soon after the announcement, the share prices of both Intel and AMD, the two prime suppliers of x86 chips, fell. To some degree, the counts of market share and profitability become more difficult as cloud companies like Google and Amazon Web Services design and contract their own highly engineered systems. While these custom-built devices aren’t counted by analyst firms, they may already represent a significant share of the world market. In effect, IBM may have sold off a business increasingly dominated by the cloud companies with which it must also compete as it builds out its own cloud. Last year IBM paid $2 billion for a cloud company called Softlayer, and last week said it would spend $1.2 billion just this year building out that business. Mr. Mills defended his company’s chances. “Softlayer operates at a cost point equal to Amazon,” he said. “I don’t worry about the competitive issue.” Google, he noted, has agreed to use sophisticated IBM chips in its computer centers. “We’ve had our eyes on the issue for some time,” he said.

Foreign   1924: Black Flags Fly All Over Russia To Mourn Lenin. Advertisement   MOSCOW — Lenin, the founder of Bolshevism, died this morning [Jan. 22]. After an illness lasting nearly two years, his condition became suddenly worse yesterday, and at five this morning  he lost consciousness, death following two hours later from paralysis of the nerve centres. He was fifty three years old. Kalinin, president of the Soviet Central Committee, announced the death to the Soviets to-day amid loud weeping. Lenin’s body will be brought to Moscow to-morrow and exposed for public view for three days. The death of the sick “Dictator” though long expected, has produced a tremendous sensation, superstitious Russians being impressed by its coinciding with the nineteenth anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Trotzky organised the first revolutionary movement in the Russian capital, and with the formation of Labor Government in London. A proclamation has been issued announcing that “Lenin is dead, but that the Soviet Republic will continue his work. The power of the Soviet Government is so strongly planted that even the death of Lenin cannot change this historic fact.” Although Lenin had been superseded for some time past by a triumvirate composed of Kameneff, Zinovieff and Stalin, who have also recently set aside Trotzky, the occult influence of the founder of Bolshevism continued to make itself felt, and only a few days ago it was announced that he was improving in health and had actually been out shooting crows. Nicholas Lenin, whose real name was Vladimir Oulianoff, was born at Simbirsk, on the Volga, on April 10, 1870. His father was a chinovnik or civil servant and had attained a rank which conferred nobility upon himself and his descendants. With the caution that characterized the whole of his career, Lenin managed to avoid arrest during several, years of revolutionary activity. It was in 1896 that the Okhrana finally got him, and two years later arrested his wife. They managed to escape with a light sentence. Already in 1900 both were free and able to take up their residence in Switzerland, living alternately in Zurich and Geneva. Lenin appealed to the  masses in a way that the most ignorant could understand. He informed peasants and workmen that — in the doctrines of Karl Marx — all property represented robbery and therefore they were perfectly justified and entitled to take it from its holders. That was the secret of his success in the Bolshevist revolution of December 7, 1917. Like most of his associates, Lenin looked only to the end, but to him it was power and nothing else; while the others imagined they could really introduce a new dispensation on earth. That is why Lenin was the first to counsel a compromise with Capitalism in the form of the “Nep” (New Economic Policy). — The New York Herald, European Edition, January 23, 1924  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Home   A Niche for Oomph. Advertisement Advertisement By RIMA SUQIJAN. 22, 2014 PIQ, a gift shop that opened last week at Grand Central Terminal, in a space formerly occupied by Pylones, is, like its predecessor, wildly colorful. But the similarities end there. “The Pylones look was about cuteness, and I was tired of cuteness,” said Frédéric A. Rambaud, a founder of the Sarut Group, which manages Pylones stores in New York (two remain) and an owner of the new PIQ. “There’s a new aspect in retail that’s a mix of day-to-day with designer toys. So the grandmother can come in and find something for the grandchildren, and at the same time find something for herself.” Depending on the grandmother’s mood and budget, such items could include sticky notes in the shape of a clock ($4.50) or a Barbie Anatomy Model, a sculpture by Jason Freeny that exposes the doll’s innards ($8,000). Intestines aside, Mr. Rambaud might be dismayed to hear that many of PIQ’s offerings are indeed “cute.” Information: 212-867-0969 or piqproducts.com.

Science   Living With Cancer: Life of the Party Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. The prospect of a party frightened me — probably because the enforced isolation of cancer treatments has rendered me hypersensitive. It was raining outside and festivities would not begin until after 8 p.m. But my husband and I had promised to attend the celebration of a book publication. So we dragged ourselves to Judith and Aidan’s house where I hoped to find a comfortable chair in which I would not look like the battle-ax at Mrs. Dalloway’s party whom everyone had thought long dead. The house, crowded with people clutching drinks, pulsed with their robust vitality. Before the cancer diagnosis, I would have moved around the room schmoozing with a series of acquaintances while getting a tad tipsy. Now I was determined to have a drink, but I would need to sit down, and I could not control who might sit with me or indeed whether anyone would. Still, sit I had to do while dealing with a hideous mix of nostalgia, jealousy and self-pity. Exhausted by five years of surgeries and drugs, I have spent too much time alone and have nothing to exchange in return for tidbits of gossip. My colleagues, kind people, took turns as sitters. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of jollity only underscored my worries: fears that thinning hair would not hide my scalp, qualms about not recalling the names of graduate students I recognized but could not place. The cumulative effect of treatment also left me bereft of the prevarications and censors that ease everyday interactions. The membrane between internal feelings and external expressions (on which I used to rely) has worn thin. I have neither the time nor the energy to maintain buffers between me and the limited world I inhabit. Cancer has made me porous and susceptible to others — those I know personally, and those I do not. A friend in mourning, or runners and spectators maimed in Boston, reduce me to tears. Have other patients experienced this permeable sense of self when the barrier between the person we present in public and our private sentiments erodes? With few filters, I really do not belong in polite society. Just when I decided to give my husband a signal for us to up and leave, two guests started to sing in a corner of the room. I settled down, pleased at not having to make chitchat with my current sitter, a very young woman with a crew cut. A succession of musicians followed, producing that vivid vibrancy only live music in an intimate space can create. By the time Jason Fickel stood up to sing, accompanying himself on his acoustic guitar, my exhilaration knew no bounds. Live music should not be reserved for memorials. Musicians ought to be allowed to play in infusion centers, hospital rooms and hospices. Or so I think as my body feels sprayed and bathed, plumped and pumped by the rhythms of a melody that comes from Jason’s mouth and hands but courses through me like currents of energy. The wine helps, undoubtedly, but it is the thrumming strings and the wry yet sonorous voice that delight me, galvanizing my attention and quickening my spirits. I sense the vibrations on my skin, in my bones, massaging the synapses of my brain: “music, sweet music, music everywhere.” Let there be trombones and guitars, flutes and pianos, singing and, especially, cellos for the sick and the dying. During my mother’s last months in assisted care, she would have loved to have heard a string quartet: harmonies returning her to pleasures displaced by old age and disease. Awash and exultant as the music ends, I recall a line of poetry — “we feel that we are greater than we know”— and turn to the girl on my right. I did not remember her because, apparently, I had never met her before. But, she explained carefully, she works out with a member of my cancer support group … in a special class. A beat, a pause, and I understand. The crew cut has to do with cancer. I shake her hand to wish her well. Her fingers are icy. A surge urges me on: the need, the palpable urgency, to pay tribute to her resolute stamina. I clasp both her frozen hands and kiss them, overwhelmed that someone so young has had to go through what she has gone through, though I scold myself too, for these eruptions of extravagant emotion are sure to make me look like a fool. By the time Don and I got home, I realized that there are liabilities but also benefits of being thin-skinned. At the party I had felt the beauty, felt the fun. Lucky, lucky, lucky, I thought as I drifted off to sleep.

Sports   A Japanese Thread in the Bronx. Advertisement Advertisement JAN. 23, 2014 It all began with Hideki Irabu, who joined the Yankees in 1997 but never lived up to the initial fanfare that greeted him. Hideki Matsui did fulfill expectations, arriving in 2003 and becoming a steady and admirable presence in the Yankee lineup through 2009. After Matsui came Kei Igawa, a left-hander who was unable to pitch effectively in the major leagues. Hiroki Kuroda and the new acquisition Masahiro Tanaka will give the Yankees two Japanese starters in their 2014 rotation. Barring a trade, there should be a third Japanese player on this year’s roster: Ichiro Suzuki, who is entering his 14th season in the majors. Did we leave anyone out? Yes. The Yankees had another Japanese player, Ryota Igarashi, who flopped as a Met and pitched in two games in pinstripes, compiling an earned run average of 12.00. Last season he was back in Japan, pitching for the Fukuoka Hawks. Here are snapshots of all six Japanese Yankees, with Tanaka set to become No. 7. IRABU 3 seasons with the Yankees, 29-20 record, 2 World Series rings, 4.80 E.R.A. He made his highly publicized major league debut at Yankee Stadium on July 10, 1997, and beat Detroit before an announced crowd of more than 51,000. But during spring training in 1999, the Yankees’ owner, George Steinbrenner, referred to him as a fat toad. Irabu died in 2011 at age 42. Advertisement MATSUI 7 seasons with the Yankees, .292 average, 140 home runs, 1 World Series ring. Nicknamed Godzilla, he hit a grand slam in his first game in the Bronx and was named the most valuable player of the 2009 World Series after his last game there as a Yankee. IGAWA 5 seasons with the Yankees, but almost all of it in the minor leagues; 2-4 record with a 6.66 E.R.A. as a Yankee. He was a $46 million fiasco, perhaps the worst misjudgment Brian Cashman has made as the Yankees’ general manager. SUZUKI 1 1/2 seasons with the Yankees, .280 average, 209 hits. At 40, he is no longer the player he once was, but he needs just 258 hits to get to 3,000 as a major leaguer. KURODA 2 seasons with the Yankees, 27-24 record, 3.31 E.R.A. He faltered in the second half of last season, but he has often been an asset for the Yankees. He turns 39 next month. IGARASHI 2 games with the Yankees, 3 innings pitched, 4 earned runs, 12.00 E.R.A. His nickname in Japan was Rocket Boy, in tribute to his fastball. In the major leagues, the only rockets were the ones hit off his pitches. An article in some editions on Thursday about Japanese players who joined the Yankees misstated the year Hideki Irabu, a pitcher for the Yankees from 1997 to 1999, died. It was 2011, not 2001.

Business   Sharing an Android Tablet. Advertisement Advertisement Q&A By J. D. BIERSDORFER JAN. 24, 2014 Q. Is it possible for two people to use one Android tablet and keep their apps and settings separate? A. Tablets running Android 4.2 (and later) have a fairly easy way to set up multiple user accounts. Like multiple accounts on a desktop computer, each user account on the tablet has its own Home screen, settings and collection of apps. Android currently allows up to eight user accounts per tablet. To add a new user to your tablet in Android 4.4, open the Settings screen. (The exact steps and screens may vary based on the Android version and device you are using.) In the Device area, tap Users. On the Users & Profiles screen, tap “Add user or profile.” You are then presented with the choice of adding a User (a separate area of the tablet for the person to have their own apps, settings and files), or a Restricted Profile (a controlled version of your own account that can limit access to certain apps and files). Tap the User option. The person with whom you are sharing the tablet will need to go through the standard setup screens for adding an email account, configuring apps and customizing the account. Once the new account is set up, each user’s name and account picture appears on the tablet’s lock screen. Google’s site has more information on adding, modifying or deleting users on the same Android device. Advertisement Adding Photos to an iPhone Mail Message Q. Is there a way to add a photo to an email on the iPhone after you’ve already written the message? A. If the iPhone is running iOS 6 or iOS 7, you can attach a picture from the Photos app without leaving the Mail program. When you have the message open, press your finger on the iPhone’s screen until you see a small pop-up menu appear. On that menu, tap the “Insert Photo or Video” option; if you are still running iOS 6, tap the white arrow to get over to it. When the Photos screen opens, navigate to the image you want to send. Select it to attach to the open message. After you tap the Send button on the message, you get an option to select a file size for the image attachment. In older versions of iOS, you can still attach a photo after a message has been started, but it takes more effort. From the open Mail message on the screen, double-click the iPhone’s Home button to switch over to the Photos app. On the screen of photo thumbnails, press and hold the image you want to use until a Copy button appears. Tap Copy, then switch back to the Mail app. Go to the area of the message where you want to insert the image, then press down on the screen until a Paste option pops up. Tap Paste to attach the photo to the message. You can also start a message from the Photos app by selecting a photo (or group of photos) and tapping the Share icon in the corner. This pops open a new blank message with the pictures already attached. You just need to compose the text and address the message before sending it all off. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   New Law to Ban Manual Removal of Human Waste Disappoints. Advertisement   India’s widespread absence of flush toilets and sewer lines means much of the country’s human waste must be scraped out by hand, and then carried in baskets to dump sites. The people who carry out this dehumanizing task, almost exclusively women from the Dalit castes, experience severe discrimination. Among the Dalits, those who are born into the lowest castes handle these jobs and are put under immense social pressure to take up the occupation themselves. Since independence, discrimination based on caste has been banned and a law banning manual scavenging was passed in Parliament in 1993, but it didn’t ban dry toilets and had no employment aid for former workers. It has gone largely unenforced. Given that the new law prohibits the hiring of such workers and provides alternative job training, one would have expected human rights advocates like Ashif Shaikh, who has devoted 12 years to getting a stronger law passed, to feel a sense of accomplishment. “We are happy about the new law,” he said. But the specifics of implementation, which are decided by government committees, were “rubbish,” he said. For instance, the text of the new law includes provisions for the rehabilitation of scavengers through a one-time cash stipend, plus access to scholarships and free vocational training. But the law’s rules, which spell out how the law will be carried out, don’t reflect the ambitious spirit of the law itself, according to Mr. Shaikh. “If you look at the rules, the word rehabilitation isn’t even used once,” he said. “When we asked the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment about the lack of any specifics in the rules as to rehabilitation, they said, ‘We are preparing separate schemes for that.’ But schemes are not law, which we can hold accountable in court.” Mr. Shaikh and his fellow activists did have high hopes at one time that the new law would have enough teeth to eradicate these jobs, which are held by around 300,000 Dalits, according to government estimates. (Some Dalit rights activists say it could easily be triple that number.) The organization that Mr. Shaikh founded, Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan (National Campaign for Dignity), led a campaign last year in which 1,000 former manual scavengers traveled from village to village across 18 states for two months, persuading other women to leave the job and join them in “liberating” others. Mr. Shaikh said 5,000 more women ended up accompanying them to their final destination in Delhi. This caught the attention of policy makers, including Jairam Ramesh, the current Minister of Rural Development. Mr. Shaikh decided to capitalize on the momentum by bringing some of his newly “liberated” scavengers to knock on the doors of more than 50 members of Parliament who represented their districts. That way, the lawmakers could not claim that manual scavenging had been eradicated in their jurisdictions. Mr. Shaikh excitedly recounted a morning when Meenakshi Natarajan, a Congress Party lawmaker from Madhya Pradesh, served him and former manual scavengers breakfast in her living room. Dalits, let alone manual scavengers, are traditionally not allowed to enter the homes of higher caste people. Mr. Shaikh said these efforts by his organization and other Dalit activists are what led to the drafting of the most recent law. But they didn’t have power to specify how the law should be carried out. He pointed to the one chapter in the rules that deals with rehabilitation, while never using that word. It has only one clause, stating that former manual scavengers will be given a one-time “cash assistance,” without specifying by whom, when or how much. If implemented, the new law would severely curtail the use of dry toilets, also known as insanitary latrines, as it carries high fines and the possibility of jail time for those who employ manual scavengers or who fail to replace latrines that require manual cleaning. Those households using insanitary latrines will be held responsible for converting or demolishing them at their own cost, or the authorities under the orders of district magistrates will convert the latrines and recover the cost from the owner. Furthermore, offices of district magistrates around the country are required to survey existing dry toilets by Feb. 6, and their subsequent destruction must take place within six months of that date. In a phone interview last month, Sanjeev Kumar, joint secretary for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, which sponsored the law, assured that these deadlines were “very strict” and that the government would spare no effort to enforce the new law, albeit mostly through existing government programs. “There is no need to worry about the specifics,” said Mr. Kumar. “Money won’t even be a consideration, not a barrier at all.” However, Manjula Pradeep, executive director of Navsarjan Trust, a Dalit rights nonprofit based in Gujarat, said that to her knowledge, with two weeks until the survey deadline, preparations haven’t yet begun in any state. “With national elections coming up, I think government is content to simply have passed the law,” she said. “Meanwhile, state governments continue to deny the widespread presence of manual scavengers in their states and use that as an excuse to delay new surveys indefinitely.” She used her own state as example, where the government has contended that Gujarat has no manual scavengers, despite two independent surveys that found over 10,000 of them. The central government, for its part, insists that it is committed to eliminating those jobs. “There can’t be a greater blot on India than the existence of manual scavenging,” Mr. Ramesh, the rural development minister, said in an interview. “Manual scavenging shows us how caste is still very much an Indian reality, and of how some of the system’s worst vestiges are still with us.” But Mr. Shaikh, having lost faith in the central government’s assurances, said his organization will now focus on state-level conventions in an attempt to pressure state governments to act upon the new law. Along with Mr. Shaikh and Ms. Pradeep, Bezwada Wilson completes the tripartite of activists who have been at the forefront of working to end the practice of manual scavenging both on the ground and through law. Mr. Wilson was born into a manual scavenging family and became one of the founders of Safai Karmachari Andolan, a people’s movement that aims to eradicate manual scavenging. Out of the three activists, he is the most radical and also the most distrusting of the government. He has already begun planning how to incorporate the expected failure to meet the Feb. 6 deadline into expansive public interest litigation against the central government. Mr. Wilson said he has given up on using political channels to accomplish his goals. “Really, the government may not have success anyway through laws,” he said. “It’s better if people like me directly go and speak these people’s language. When I go. I tell them, ‘There are 130 crore [1.3 billion] people in this country, and just like you most of them are poor. But only so many of them are scavenging. There are ways to live outside of this, even as a poor person,’ ” he said, pacing around his office. “Sometimes they don’t think they can just be a regular poor person.” He settled back into his chair and shook his head. “Still! The government should make an actual vision,” he said. “Tell us it will take 10 years. Just be honest.” India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Not Your Grandmother’s Gratin Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   In my kitchen, leftovers often become the inspiration for a week of Recipes for Health. This happened last week. If you had opened my refrigerator on Sunday you would have found a selection of roasted vegetables, which I had prepared over the weekend for various dinners and recipe tests. By Tuesday those vegetables had found their way into three winter gratins. A vegetable gratin is a casserole that is baked in the oven in a heavy baking dish until the top and sides are browned, or gratinéed. Roasting vegetables for a gratin adds another level of caramelized flavor to the dish. Roasted winter squash is particularly sweet. Roasting cauliflower coaxes flavor out of this somewhat bland vegetable: the small flowers brown and crisp, and I was hard pressed to save enough for my gratin, so tempting a snack were they. I begin just about any eggplant dish I make by roasting the eggplant, as this method of cooking requires much less oil than frying. I didn’t roast the vegetables in every one of this week’s recipes, but in all of the gratins the vegetables are cooked before being mixed with aromatics, cheese, eggs and, in all but one recipe, milk (in the cauliflower gratin, there is a tomato sauce rather than a milk and egg custard). I served them as main dishes and have been enjoying leftovers for lunch. They are delicious at room temperature as well as hot. Potato and Sorrel Gratin: A gratin that is not a typical creamy sliced potato gratin but more like a potato pie.  Roasted Squash and Red Onion Gratin With Quinoa: Roasting the squash results in a sweet layer of flavor in this beautiful gratin.  Fennel, Kale and Rice Gratin: Two different greens provide contrast in this casserole.  Roasted Cauliflower Gratin With Tomatoes and Goat Cheese: A beautiful, light gratin with Middle Eastern spices.

Business   Sufficient Financing to Aid Troubled Banks, European Officials Say. Advertisement    Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said at the World Economic Forum that if ailing banks were not able to raise capital from investors, they would draw it from their own governments, and as a last resort, from the European bailout fund. “The instruments are there,” Mr. Dijsselbloem, who is also the finance minister the Netherlands, said during a panel discussion. That level of certainty surprised at least one of the experts on the panel, Adair Turner, a former top bank regulator in Britain. Reflecting a widespread concern, Mr. Turner had expressed doubt whether Europe was prepared for the consequences if the European Central Bank’s scrutiny of the largest banks in the euro zone uncovered any that had grave problems that were previously hidden. “Is that already agreed?” he asked, referring to use of the bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Mr. Dijsselbloem replied that euro zone finance ministers had agreed in principle and would grant final approval in March. “We will deal with all these issues,” he said. Among policy makers and many in the banking industry, there is broad agreement that Europe needs to carry out the same kind of rigorous cleanup of financial institutions that the United States did in 2009, helping restart lending and create the conditions for economic recovery. The European Central Bank is in the process of scouring bank books, looking for bad loans, sour investments or other problems that banks may have kept hidden. Fear that some banks are papering over serious problems has made it difficult for all banks in the euro zone to raise money that they can lend to businesses and consumers. The aim of the review is to ultimately restore the credibility of banks in the 18 countries of the euro zone. “There is still a clear lack of trust in the European banking system,” said Federico Ghizzoni, chief executive of UniCredit, the largest bank in Italy. “This has to be dissipated thanks to this exercise.” In the United States, banks with problems were forced to take capital from the government if they could not raise it themselves from investors. But Germany and some other countries have been reluctant to help finance bank cleanups in other euro zone countries. And there has been doubt whether countries like Portugal, already struggling with excess government debt, could afford bank rescues if any were needed. Also on the panel was Wolfgang Schäuble, finance minister of Germany, who did not contradict Mr Dijsselbloem. “It will work, it has been decided,” Mr. Schäuble said of the bank recapitalization plan, though he added that money would also come from a fund paid for by the banking industry, and only after bank creditors and shareholders had contributed. Echoing comments made on Friday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Dijsselbloem insisted that the review of banks would be comprehensive, in contrast to earlier attempts that failed to uncover serious problems. “I rather hope that it’s going to unveil some unpleasantness because that would give me a good feeling that it has been done properly,” he said. However, some on the panel doubted that lack of trust was the only reason that lending to businesses in the euro zone has been on the decline. Many businesses are reluctant to borrow money because of uncertainty about the strength of the economy, said Anshu Jain, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank. “There is a demand side problem as well,” he said.

Business   Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train. Advertisement Advertisement By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWADJAN. 25, 2014 CASSELTON, N.D. — Kerry’s Kitchen is where Casselton residents gather for gossip and comfort food, especially the caramel rolls baked fresh every morning. But a fiery rail accident last month only a half mile down the tracks, which prompted residents to evacuate the town, has shattered this calm, along with people’s confidence in the crude-oil convoys that rumble past Kerry’s seven times a day. What was first seen as a stopgap measure in the absence of pipelines has become a fixture in the nation’s energy landscape — about 200 “virtual pipelines” that snake in endless processions across the horizon daily. It can take more than five minutes for a single oil train, made up of about 100 tank cars, to pass by Kerry’s, giving this bedroom community 20 miles west of Fargo a front-row seat to the growing practice of using trains to carry oil. “I feel a little on edge — actually very edgy — every time one of those trains passes,” said Kerry Radermacher, who owns the coffee shop. “Most people think we should slow the production, and the trains, down.” Casselton is near the center of the great oil and gas boom unleashed these last few years. And it has seen up close how trains have increasingly been used to transport the oil from the new fields of Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, in part as a result of delays in the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. About 400,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail last year to the nation’s refineries, up from 9,500 in 2008, according to the Association of American Railroads. But a series of recent accidents — including one in Quebec last July that killed 47 people and another in Alabama last November — have prompted many to question these shipments and have increased the pressure on regulators to take an urgent look at the safety of the oil shipments. Advertisement In the race for profits and energy independence, critics say producers took shortcuts to get the oil to market as quickly as possible without weighing the hazards of train shipments. Today about two-thirds of the production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field rides on rails because of a shortage of pipelines. And more than 10 percent of the nation’s total oil production is shipped by rail. Since March there have been no fewer than 10 large crude spills in the United States and Canada because of rail accidents. The number of gallons spilled in the United States last year, federal records show, far outpaced the total amount spilled by railroads from 1975 to 2012. Railroad executives, meeting with the transportation secretary and federal regulators recently, pledged to look for ways to make oil convoys safer — including slowing down the trains or rerouting them from heavily populated areas. (Trains go up to roughly 35 miles an hour through towns and at higher speeds outside populated areas.) They also agreed to speed up a review of tougher standards for the train cars used for oil. And last Thursday, safety officials urged regulators to quickly improve industry standards. Advertisement “This is an industry that has developed overnight, and they have been playing catch-up with the infrastructure,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Casselton accident. “A lot of what we’ve seen could have been a lot worse.” But given the fragmented nature of the business — different companies produce the oil, own the rail cars, and run the railroads — there is no firm consensus on what to do. And few analysts expect new regulations this year. “There was no political pressure to address this issue in the past, but there clearly is now,” said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “Producers need to understand that rail-car safety can become an impediment to production.” The stakes are high. In five years, domestic oil production has jumped by 50 percent, to reach 7.5 million barrels a day last year. But with little pipeline infrastructure, energy producers had to scramble for new ways to get their oil to refiners. Rail was the answer. “The reality is that this came out of nowhere,” said Anthony B. Hatch, a rail transport consultant. “Rail has gone from near-obsolescence to being critical to oil supplies. It’s as if the buggy-whips were back in style.” Advertisement Far more toxic products are shipped on trains. But those products, like chlorine, are transported in pressurized vessels designed to survive an accident. Crude oil, on the other hand, is shipped in a type of tank car that entered service in 1964 and that has been traditionally used for nonflammable hazardous liquids like liquid fertilizers. Safety officials have warned for more than two decades that these cars were unsuited to carry flammable cargo: their shell can puncture and tears up too easily in a crash. In 2009, a train carrying ethanol derailed and exploded, killing one person in Cherry Valley, Ill. The National Transportation Safety Board said the inadequate design of the tank cars made them “subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials.” As domestic oil production has increased rapidly in recent years, more and more of it is being transported by rail because of the lack of pipeline capacity. The trains often travel through populated areas, leading to concerns among residents over the hazards they can pose, including spills and fires. 400 thousand Number of oil freight railroad cars 300 Some major oil freight railroad lines Casselton 200 Glenwood 100 Portage Minneapolis/St. Paul Milwaukee Chicago ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 Kansas City 3.0 billion barrels Shale plays Topeka St. Louis U.S. oil field production 2.5 Parsons Dexter Junction Stroud Bakersfield El Reno 2.0 Memphis Midwest City Little Rock Pine Bluff 1.5 Fort Worth Monroe Odessa Share transported by rail 1.0 Hearne Houston St. James Harwood 0.5 Galveston 10% Gardendale 7% 0.0 2% 1% ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 After that accident, railroads and car owners agreed in 2011 to beef up new cars with better protections and thicker steel. But they resisted improving safety features on the existing fleet because of cost. They also argued that thousands of new cars were being ordered anyway, so it would be just a matter of time before the fleet was replaced. But analysts said that time has run out; railroads and car owners can no longer ignore the liabilities associated with oil trains, which could reach $1 billion in the Quebec accident. “Quebec shocked the industry,” Mr. Hatch said, adding that while rail safety has improved over all, “the consequences of any accident are rising.” Last November, the Association of American Railroads said it would support requiring that the 92,000 tank cars used to transport flammable liquids, including crude oil, be retrofitted with better safety features or “aggressively phased out.” Still, other groups have resisted. The Railway Supply Institute, which represents freight car owners, told regulators three weeks before the Casselton accident that existing cars “already provide substantial protection in the event of a derailment” and suggested minor modifications to be phased in over 10 years. Advertisement While the safety record of railroads has improved in recent years, the surge in oil transportation has meant a spike in spill rates. From 1975 to 2012, federal records show, railroads spilled 800,000 gallons of crude oil. Last year alone, they spilled more than 1.15 million gallons, according to an analyis of data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration done by McClatchy Newspapers. That figure includes the Casselton spill, estimated at about 400,000 gallons. The accidents have also created a sense of weariness among elected officials and even staunch oil backers. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, insisted that the first priority was improving tank cars. “These exploding tank cars are obviously very powerful and very dangerous,” he said. The accidents have brought another problem to light. Crude oil produced in the Bakken appears to be a lot more volatile than other grades of oil, something that could explain why the oil trains have had huge explosions. Here too, the warnings came too late. Federal regulators started analyzing samples from a few Bakken wells last year to test their flammability. In an alert issued on Jan. 2, P.H.M.S.A. said the crude posed a “significant fire risk” in an accident. The Federal Railroad Administration also pointed to rising numbers of oil cars that showed a “form of severe corrosion” on the inside of the tanks, covers and valves. After the recent meeting with regulators, the American Petroleum Institute pledged it would share its own test data about the oil, which they have said is proprietary. While the tank cars themselves have not caused any accident, they failed to contain their cargo. That happened on the outskirts of Casselton when a 106-car oil train crashed into a soybean train that derailed on a parallel track. Advertisement In a preliminary report, the N.T.S.B. said 18 of the 20 oil tank cars that derailed were punctured. Much of the oil spilled was incinerated by the explosions, and some soaked into nearby corn fields. Aside from evacuating nearby farms, there was little the fire department could do but watch the train burn. Tim McLean, Casselton’s fire chief, pictured what the town would look like if an oil train derailed. The large propane supply tank would explode “like a bomb” and incinerate two multifamily houses next to it. Five blocks to the west are a lumber yard and two gasoline stations. Oil might accumulate in storm sewers and possibly spread a fire underground. “There’s virtually no way we could protect these buildings,” he said as he passed the barber shops, drugstore and pizza parlor, all occupying sturdy brick buildings more than a century old. “It would be too hot.” The terror of what might have happened hit many here immediately. Adrian Kieffer, the assistant fire chief, rushed to the accident and spent nearly 12 hours there, finishing at 3 a.m. “When I got home that night, my wife said let’s sell our home and move,” he said. An article last Sunday about the dangers posed by increased shipping of crude oil by rail omitted credit for a data analysis showing the quantity of oil spilled in rail shipments in 2013. It was done by McClatchy Newspapers, using data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. It was not analyzed by the administration itself. In addition, an accompanying chart omitted a label in one section. The bar chart of oil freight rail cars should have indicated the numbers were in thousands. The article also described the Casselton spill incorrectly in relation to last year’s spillage. The 400,000 gallons spilled at Casselton was included in the overall 1.15 million gallons spilled; it was not excluded. And a credit for a picture of a fiery rail accident in Casselton, N.D., in December misidentified the photographer. The picture was taken by Dawn Faught, a local photographer — not by the son of a coffee shop owner on whose phone it appeared.

Foreign   China Sentences Legal Activist to 4 Years for Role in Protests. Advertisement Advertisement By ANDREW JACOBS and CHRIS BUCKLEYJAN. 25, 2014 BEIJING — A Chinese court sentenced a prominent legal activist to four years in prison Sunday in a case widely seen as a demonstration of the Communist Party leadership’s determination to quell any challenges to its hold on power. The activist, Xu Zhiyong, was convicted of “gathering a crowd to disturb public order,” a charge that stemmed from his role organizing a grass-roots New Citizens Movement, which sought to give voice to public discontent over official corruption and social injustice. After a judge of the No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court in Beijing announced the guilty verdict and sentence, Mr. Xu denounced the trial as he was led away by guards, said one of Mr. Xu’s lawyers, Zhang Qingfang. “He said, ‘The court today has completely destroyed what remained of respect for rule of law in China,’ and then he was taken away,” said Mr. Zhang. His account of the verdict and Mr. Xu’s comment was confirmed by the other defense lawyer, Yang Jinzhu. “He can still appeal, but this outcome was decided by the senior leaders, and there’s no hope of changing the verdict,” Mr. Zhang said. He said the court could have imposed a maximum sentence of five years. Advertisement The judgment, coming unusually swiftly after a trial Wednesday, will silence Mr. Xu for now. But the sentence could also enhance Mr. Xu’s prominence as an advocate for political liberalization. Mr. Xu and his two lawyers remained silent in protest for most of the proceedings, but Mr. Xu used his concluding statement to deliver part of an impassioned manifesto for democratic change, free speech and rule of law. The full text has circulated on the Internet. For the verdict hearing, the police stood guard for blocks around the courthouse, keeping away journalists, diplomats and ordinary citizens concerned about the case. Journalists who tried to approach the court were told to leave. As the first prosecution of a high-profile activist under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party secretary who took power in November 2012, the case was seen as a barometer of how China’s new leadership — the first in a decade — would respond to organized calls for reform. Some liberal intellectuals and rights advocates initially hoped that Mr. Xi would be more tolerant than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, of mild campaigns for change. In 2012, Mr. Xu helped promote the New Citizens Movement, an organization that drew up to 5,000 members dedicated to fighting government graft and education policies restricting the children of rural migrants from attending big city schools. While many of the group’s activities involved informal discussions at restaurants across the country, some of its members took part in small street rallies in 2012 and early 2013 that unnerved the Communist Party leadership. Prosecutors claimed Mr. Xu was the “ringleader” of several protests in Beijing during which participants held aloft banners denouncing corruption or demanding an end to the nation’s discriminatory education policies. Other participants in the New Citizens Movement and similar protests also face prosecution, including two who stood trial in the two days after Mr. Xu’s trial. Four others face trial Monday in Beijing, according to Human Rights in China. Legal experts and human rights advocates described the prosecution of Mr. Xu as deeply flawed. His lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, whose testimony was submitted in writing only so they did not appear in court. Nor were the defense lawyers permitted to call in witnesses of their own. Advertisement Mr. Xu’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the legality of holding separate trials for the New Citizens Movement defendants in Beijing, a move they said prevented them from benefiting from testimony that could help in their defense. Mr. Zhang, one of his lawyers, called the trial last Wednesday “a piece of theater.” Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Mr. Xu’s slapdash prosecution and the sentence were designed to deter others seeking to agitate against the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. “It sends out the message that the law is essentially a tool for the party to rule the citizenry, not for the citizenry to curtail the power of the state,” he said. Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

Society   And Their Beat Goes On. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIJAN. 26, 2014 Margaret Mary Ocampo and Benjamin Paul Scheck were married Saturday at St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens. Msgr. Michael J. Brennan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. The bride, 26, teaches fourth grade at Public School 169 in the Bronx. She graduated magna cum laude from Queens College and received a master’s degree in the literacy specialist program at Columbia. She is a daughter of Monserrat M. Washburn of East Meadow, N.Y., and Jaime M. Ocampo of Queens Village. The groom, also 26, is a certified public accountant who works in Manhattan as an internal auditor with Advance Publications, a publisher of magazines and newspapers. He graduated from Baruch College, where he also received a master’s degree in taxation. He is the son of Angela Scheck and Robert I. Scheck of Flushing. The couple met in 2005 when they were high school seniors at St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. Advertisement “We sat across from each other in a computer class,” Mr. Scheck recalled. “I had never seen her before. I really wanted to get to know her.” Eventually he completed that assignment. “It took about a month; I had to build up a little courage,” he said. “She was a lot of fun, being with her just seemed right.” They were soon inseparable. “I liked the fact that we had a similar sense of humor,” Ms. Ocampo said. “We also both loved music; he was more a fan of classic rock and I liked classical and pop.” That shared love led to the creation of their rock band, Cover Fire, during their senior year in college. She is the lead singer. He plays bass guitar. “It’s still a lot of fun,” Ms. Ocampo said. On Nov. 22, 2012, Mr. Scheck proposed to Ms. Ocampo beneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. “I was taking photos and then I turned around to find him down on one knee,” she said. “At that point we had been going out for years and had been on so many trips together that I really didn’t expect anything. I was truly shocked.” VINCENT M. MALLOZZI A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page ST13 of the New York edition with the headline: And Their Beat Goes On.

Sports   Ducks Triumph at Dodger Stadium as Volleyballs and Frisbees Fly. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREN CROUSEJAN. 26, 2014 LOS ANGELES — Outdoor hockey, Southern California-style, debuted Saturday night with face-offs and Frisbees, spiked volleyballs and a stuffed penalty shot, Bob Miller partnering with Vin Scully and the iconoclastic pitcher Brian Wilson mingling with the icon Wayne Gretzky. The temperature at the start of the history-making game at Dodger Stadium between the Kings and the visiting Anaheim Ducks, rivals separated by 31 miles of interstate, was 61 degrees with a slight breeze. The balmy weather notwithstanding, it was easy to get the chills during the first regular-season outdoor hockey game in California, won by the Ducks in a 3-0 shutout. First there was a joint introduction by the Kings’ Miller and the Dodgers’ Scully, the city’s two legendary broadcasters. Then Gretzky performed the ceremonial opening puck drop, the only man for the honor given how he single-handedly made hockey cool in warm-weather cities. By the time the game started, the crowd of 54,099 was in full roar, with “Go Kings Go” cries followed by chants of “Beat L.A.” It was left to Jonas Hiller, the Ducks goaltender, to silence the Kings crowd, and he was more than up to the task. Hiller, who will represent Switzerland at next month’s Sochi Games, made 36 saves, including 20 in the opening 20 minutes, to leave his mark in the hallowed home of Koufax and Kershaw, where other visitors have included the Beatles and the Pope. Advertisement Corey Perry, who described the experience of playing outdoors as “getting back to your roots,” swept a loose puck past the Kings’ goaltender, Jonathan Quick, in the third minute for his 28th goal of the season. Matt Beleskey redirected the puck past Quick less than six minutes later. Collecting the second assist was Teemu Selanne, 43, who first graced a Ducks jersey in February of 1996, when Beleskey was 7. Asked if he enjoyed the game, Selanne said: “Absolutely. Way more than a normal game. It was a great experience.” For the Ducks, maybe. In the 10th minute, Anze Kopitar was awarded a penalty shot but he was stopped by Hiller. When Kopitar failed to score, the air went out of the lungs of the Kings fans. Anyone who follows the team knows well its recent struggles to put the puck in the net. In their last five games, all losses, the Kings have been outscored, 16-8. They haven’t scored since Kopitar’s goal in the fourth minute of their game Thursday against the Ducks in Anaheim. The puck at times bounced off players’ sticks like a bad grounder off a shortstop’s glove. The ice, while slushier than usual, was not terrible. Ben Lovejoy, the Ducks defenseman responsible for hooking Kopitar to set up the penalty shot, had described the ice as “good enough” after practicing on it Friday. On the eve of the game, Lovejoy said, “We might not want to skate on this ice 82 times a year, but for one night against the Kings in January this is going to be the best thing that’s happened to hockey in Southern California.” Since Gretzky, that is. The Battle at the Ballpark, as Miller coined it, was a spectacle that Gretzky built one point at a time during his eight years as the National Hockey League’s L.A.-based proselytizer of puck. He delivered everything to Southern California but the Stanley Cup, and since his retirement both the Kings and Ducks have taken care of that piece of unfinished business, with the Ducks winning the N.H.L. championship in 2007 and the Kings taking the title in 2012. “If somebody would tell me 10 years ago that we’re going to have an outdoor game here, that would really sound crazy,” Selanne said. “Everything is different now than it used to be. California has become a big hockey place.” Advertisement The rock band KISS, conceived in New York and commanded by Gene Simmons, performed before the game and during the first intermission. Five for Fighting — the rock band, not a group of Vancouver Canucks – performed in the second intermission. When the hockey stopped, the children’s bandy game and the adult beach volleyball matches began anew, headlined by Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who also happens to be a die-hard fan of the Dodgers’ big rivals, the San Francisco Giants. Other sports luminaries in attendance included Wilson, the Dodgers’ Mohawk-shorn pitcher, Yasiel Puig, Fernando Valenzuela and Tommy Lasorda. On this might it did not matter if you were a Dodger hater or a beloved former Dodger, a Ducks fan or a Kings fan, a hockey purist or an arriviste here to watch and be seen. What mattered was that on an unusually warm winter’s night, the beach balls and the Frisbees and the sand and the rock musicians were the side shows and the N.H.L., in a twist that would have been inconceivable a quarter of a century ago, was the main act.

Travel   Amy Tan’s Evolving Sense of China. Advertisement Advertisement By KENAN CHRISTIANSENJAN. 24, 2014 In 1949, Amy Tan’s mother boarded one of the last ships heading from Shanghai to San Francisco before “China became Red China and the bamboo curtain descended.” There, her mother reunited with her husband and the couple relocated to Oakland, where a couple of years later she was born. As a child, she knew little more about China than an “American pastiche of stereotypes,” and that some of her family had been lucky enough to make it out, while others had not. For years she organized her thinking around those divisions, until revelations about her family and the country her parents fled broke them down. Below are excerpts from correspondence with Ms. Tan, 61, whose latest novel is “The Valley of Amazement,” about how her relationship with China changed over time. Q. What were your earliest thoughts about China? A. Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, I thought of China as a prison that everyone wanted to escape. My parents considered themselves lucky that they were able to leave before 1949. Other family members were not quite as lucky and wound up in Formosa — that’s what we called Taiwan in those days. They sent us letters that described hard work and lack of proper food, hygiene and clothing. In their photos, they looked shockingly weathered and shiny with sweat. We received no letters from China and prayed for those silent ones whose whereabouts were unknown. If America was heaven, Formosa would be limbo, and China would be hell. Were you ever in contact with those family members before visiting?  When I was 16, after my father died, my mother told me that she had been married to another man in Shanghai before she met my father. I could hardly comprehend this stunning news, when she added she also had three daughters in China. She did not explain why they were in China, whereas she was in California. Years later she would only say that her previous husband had been a bad man. If I pressed her she would have said that I did not understand because I was an American. That was her typical lament when I did not seem to appreciate the tragedies of her life, like the suicide of her mother, which left her alone — abandoned, really — at the age of 9. She showed me their photos. The middle daughter, Jindo, was beautiful. She resembled my mother. She also fit the stereotype of peasants I had imagined in childhood. She wore a conical hat and farmer’s clothing, and she was standing next to a rice field. That could have been my life. Afterward, China was no longer an invisible jail. I now imagined myself living there, wearing a conical hat and writing letters late at night to my mother, in beautiful Chinese calligraphy like that of my newfound sisters. “I dream every day you will return,” Jindo had written her. “When you do, my happiness will be restored.” Advertisement Did she return? Yes, in 1979, after a 30-year separation, my mother went to visit her three daughters. Jindo lived in a village of rice farmers. She had married a surgeon, and they and several comrades served my mother a modest feast in a shack whose walls were lined with newspaper to keep out the cold. When was your first visit? In 1987, my mother, husband and I went together. We stepped out of the plane into an airport painted toothpaste green. I had assumed I would blend in with the masses. Instead, I was surrounded by locals who gawked at me and made open comments about my outlandish purple clothing. These days, I go about once a year. The most gleamingly modern airports I’ve been to are in China. The coolest and most technologically challenging hotel I’ve ever stayed in is in China. The most tricked-out hair salon I’ve been to is in China. The worst pollution I’ve endured is in China. I keep going back for more of the most. Not everyone wants to escape anymore. In fact, it is more often the case that Chinese students go to the U.S. to study and return to start companies and make millions. Has your attitude on China changed? I look at China not as a land of burdens and debt but the land of origin that gave our family its improbable history. I once traveled with Jindo on a long ferry ride to a mansion, the one on the island near Shanghai, where my mother grew up, where Jindo also grew up. I listened to her stories about working in the rice fields, where she wore the conical hat and danced and yelled as she pulled leeches off her calves. She eventually told me what happened to her after our mother left, about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father’s concubine. As Jindo re-enacted the past, she flung her arms and beat her chest, and it must have appeared that we were having a violent argument. “It was not right,” she said repeatedly, and she meant what her stepmother did to her, and also what her father did to our mother, and what my mother did in choosing to be with a lover rather than with her three daughters, and then in marrying that lover and having three children by him, one of them a daughter, who was sitting next to her, listening to her cry. An answer in the Q&A column on Jan. 26, in which the novelist Amy Tan discussed her relationship with China and how it has changed over time, referred incorrectly to a relative in China. Her half-sister married a surgeon, not a “barefoot doctor.” A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: Amy Tan Reflects on China and Uncovering Secrets of Her Origins.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Business   Wheelies: The Detroit Rising Edition. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 28, 2014 A roundup of motoring news from the web: ■ This year’s Detroit auto show reported its highest attendance in more than 10 years. A total of 803,451 people visited the 2014 show — a significant one for General Motors, which took both the North American car and truck of the year awards. Attendance has not been that high since 838,066 people came to the show in 2003. (Jalopnik) ■ In its efforts to get people used to the idea that its new F-150 pickup trucks will be built with aluminum bodies, Ford told its dealers Sunday that the new trucks will actually be cheaper and easier to repair than the outgoing model. Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ BMW says that its all-electric i3 will arrive in American showrooms in May, priced similarly to the 3 Series. Ludwig Willisch, who heads BMW North America, said that the United States would be the company’s largest market for the i Series electric cars, adding that demand for the i3 will most likely outstrip supply in the first year of production.

Business   Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train. Advertisement Advertisement By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWADJAN. 25, 2014 CASSELTON, N.D. — Kerry’s Kitchen is where Casselton residents gather for gossip and comfort food, especially the caramel rolls baked fresh every morning. But a fiery rail accident last month only a half mile down the tracks, which prompted residents to evacuate the town, has shattered this calm, along with people’s confidence in the crude-oil convoys that rumble past Kerry’s seven times a day. What was first seen as a stopgap measure in the absence of pipelines has become a fixture in the nation’s energy landscape — about 200 “virtual pipelines” that snake in endless processions across the horizon daily. It can take more than five minutes for a single oil train, made up of about 100 tank cars, to pass by Kerry’s, giving this bedroom community 20 miles west of Fargo a front-row seat to the growing practice of using trains to carry oil. “I feel a little on edge — actually very edgy — every time one of those trains passes,” said Kerry Radermacher, who owns the coffee shop. “Most people think we should slow the production, and the trains, down.” Casselton is near the center of the great oil and gas boom unleashed these last few years. And it has seen up close how trains have increasingly been used to transport the oil from the new fields of Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, in part as a result of delays in the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. About 400,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail last year to the nation’s refineries, up from 9,500 in 2008, according to the Association of American Railroads. But a series of recent accidents — including one in Quebec last July that killed 47 people and another in Alabama last November — have prompted many to question these shipments and have increased the pressure on regulators to take an urgent look at the safety of the oil shipments. Advertisement In the race for profits and energy independence, critics say producers took shortcuts to get the oil to market as quickly as possible without weighing the hazards of train shipments. Today about two-thirds of the production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field rides on rails because of a shortage of pipelines. And more than 10 percent of the nation’s total oil production is shipped by rail. Since March there have been no fewer than 10 large crude spills in the United States and Canada because of rail accidents. The number of gallons spilled in the United States last year, federal records show, far outpaced the total amount spilled by railroads from 1975 to 2012. Railroad executives, meeting with the transportation secretary and federal regulators recently, pledged to look for ways to make oil convoys safer — including slowing down the trains or rerouting them from heavily populated areas. (Trains go up to roughly 35 miles an hour through towns and at higher speeds outside populated areas.) They also agreed to speed up a review of tougher standards for the train cars used for oil. And last Thursday, safety officials urged regulators to quickly improve industry standards. Advertisement “This is an industry that has developed overnight, and they have been playing catch-up with the infrastructure,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Casselton accident. “A lot of what we’ve seen could have been a lot worse.” But given the fragmented nature of the business — different companies produce the oil, own the rail cars, and run the railroads — there is no firm consensus on what to do. And few analysts expect new regulations this year. “There was no political pressure to address this issue in the past, but there clearly is now,” said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “Producers need to understand that rail-car safety can become an impediment to production.” The stakes are high. In five years, domestic oil production has jumped by 50 percent, to reach 7.5 million barrels a day last year. But with little pipeline infrastructure, energy producers had to scramble for new ways to get their oil to refiners. Rail was the answer. “The reality is that this came out of nowhere,” said Anthony B. Hatch, a rail transport consultant. “Rail has gone from near-obsolescence to being critical to oil supplies. It’s as if the buggy-whips were back in style.” Advertisement Far more toxic products are shipped on trains. But those products, like chlorine, are transported in pressurized vessels designed to survive an accident. Crude oil, on the other hand, is shipped in a type of tank car that entered service in 1964 and that has been traditionally used for nonflammable hazardous liquids like liquid fertilizers. Safety officials have warned for more than two decades that these cars were unsuited to carry flammable cargo: their shell can puncture and tears up too easily in a crash. In 2009, a train carrying ethanol derailed and exploded, killing one person in Cherry Valley, Ill. The National Transportation Safety Board said the inadequate design of the tank cars made them “subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials.” As domestic oil production has increased rapidly in recent years, more and more of it is being transported by rail because of the lack of pipeline capacity. The trains often travel through populated areas, leading to concerns among residents over the hazards they can pose, including spills and fires. 400 thousand Number of oil freight railroad cars 300 Some major oil freight railroad lines Casselton 200 Glenwood 100 Portage Minneapolis/St. Paul Milwaukee Chicago ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 Kansas City 3.0 billion barrels Shale plays Topeka St. Louis U.S. oil field production 2.5 Parsons Dexter Junction Stroud Bakersfield El Reno 2.0 Memphis Midwest City Little Rock Pine Bluff 1.5 Fort Worth Monroe Odessa Share transported by rail 1.0 Hearne Houston St. James Harwood 0.5 Galveston 10% Gardendale 7% 0.0 2% 1% ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 After that accident, railroads and car owners agreed in 2011 to beef up new cars with better protections and thicker steel. But they resisted improving safety features on the existing fleet because of cost. They also argued that thousands of new cars were being ordered anyway, so it would be just a matter of time before the fleet was replaced. But analysts said that time has run out; railroads and car owners can no longer ignore the liabilities associated with oil trains, which could reach $1 billion in the Quebec accident. “Quebec shocked the industry,” Mr. Hatch said, adding that while rail safety has improved over all, “the consequences of any accident are rising.” Last November, the Association of American Railroads said it would support requiring that the 92,000 tank cars used to transport flammable liquids, including crude oil, be retrofitted with better safety features or “aggressively phased out.” Still, other groups have resisted. The Railway Supply Institute, which represents freight car owners, told regulators three weeks before the Casselton accident that existing cars “already provide substantial protection in the event of a derailment” and suggested minor modifications to be phased in over 10 years. Advertisement While the safety record of railroads has improved in recent years, the surge in oil transportation has meant a spike in spill rates. From 1975 to 2012, federal records show, railroads spilled 800,000 gallons of crude oil. Last year alone, they spilled more than 1.15 million gallons, according to an analyis of data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration done by McClatchy Newspapers. That figure includes the Casselton spill, estimated at about 400,000 gallons. The accidents have also created a sense of weariness among elected officials and even staunch oil backers. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, insisted that the first priority was improving tank cars. “These exploding tank cars are obviously very powerful and very dangerous,” he said. The accidents have brought another problem to light. Crude oil produced in the Bakken appears to be a lot more volatile than other grades of oil, something that could explain why the oil trains have had huge explosions. Here too, the warnings came too late. Federal regulators started analyzing samples from a few Bakken wells last year to test their flammability. In an alert issued on Jan. 2, P.H.M.S.A. said the crude posed a “significant fire risk” in an accident. The Federal Railroad Administration also pointed to rising numbers of oil cars that showed a “form of severe corrosion” on the inside of the tanks, covers and valves. After the recent meeting with regulators, the American Petroleum Institute pledged it would share its own test data about the oil, which they have said is proprietary. While the tank cars themselves have not caused any accident, they failed to contain their cargo. That happened on the outskirts of Casselton when a 106-car oil train crashed into a soybean train that derailed on a parallel track. Advertisement In a preliminary report, the N.T.S.B. said 18 of the 20 oil tank cars that derailed were punctured. Much of the oil spilled was incinerated by the explosions, and some soaked into nearby corn fields. Aside from evacuating nearby farms, there was little the fire department could do but watch the train burn. Tim McLean, Casselton’s fire chief, pictured what the town would look like if an oil train derailed. The large propane supply tank would explode “like a bomb” and incinerate two multifamily houses next to it. Five blocks to the west are a lumber yard and two gasoline stations. Oil might accumulate in storm sewers and possibly spread a fire underground. “There’s virtually no way we could protect these buildings,” he said as he passed the barber shops, drugstore and pizza parlor, all occupying sturdy brick buildings more than a century old. “It would be too hot.” The terror of what might have happened hit many here immediately. Adrian Kieffer, the assistant fire chief, rushed to the accident and spent nearly 12 hours there, finishing at 3 a.m. “When I got home that night, my wife said let’s sell our home and move,” he said. An article last Sunday about the dangers posed by increased shipping of crude oil by rail omitted credit for a data analysis showing the quantity of oil spilled in rail shipments in 2013. It was done by McClatchy Newspapers, using data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. It was not analyzed by the administration itself. In addition, an accompanying chart omitted a label in one section. The bar chart of oil freight rail cars should have indicated the numbers were in thousands. The article also described the Casselton spill incorrectly in relation to last year’s spillage. The 400,000 gallons spilled at Casselton was included in the overall 1.15 million gallons spilled; it was not excluded. And a credit for a picture of a fiery rail accident in Casselton, N.D., in December misidentified the photographer. The picture was taken by Dawn Faught, a local photographer — not by the son of a coffee shop owner on whose phone it appeared. A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train.

Foreign   China Sentences Legal Activist to 4 Years for Role in Protests. Advertisement Advertisement By ANDREW JACOBS and CHRIS BUCKLEYJAN. 25, 2014 BEIJING — A Chinese court sentenced a prominent legal activist to four years in prison Sunday in a case widely seen as a demonstration of the Communist Party leadership’s determination to quell any challenges to its hold on power. The activist, Xu Zhiyong, was convicted of “gathering a crowd to disturb public order,” a charge that stemmed from his role organizing a grass-roots New Citizens Movement, which sought to give voice to public discontent over official corruption and social injustice. After a judge of the No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court in Beijing announced the guilty verdict and sentence, Mr. Xu denounced the trial as he was led away by guards, said one of Mr. Xu’s lawyers, Zhang Qingfang. “He said, ‘The court today has completely destroyed what remained of respect for rule of law in China,’ and then he was taken away,” said Mr. Zhang. His account of the verdict and Mr. Xu’s comment was confirmed by the other defense lawyer, Yang Jinzhu. “He can still appeal, but this outcome was decided by the senior leaders, and there’s no hope of changing the verdict,” Mr. Zhang said. He said the court could have imposed a maximum sentence of five years. Advertisement The judgment, coming unusually swiftly after a trial Wednesday, will silence Mr. Xu for now. But the sentence could also enhance Mr. Xu’s prominence as an advocate for political liberalization. Mr. Xu and his two lawyers remained silent in protest for most of the proceedings, but Mr. Xu used his concluding statement to deliver part of an impassioned manifesto for democratic change, free speech and rule of law. The full text has circulated on the Internet. For the verdict hearing, the police stood guard for blocks around the courthouse, keeping away journalists, diplomats and ordinary citizens concerned about the case. Journalists who tried to approach the court were told to leave. As the first prosecution of a high-profile activist under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party secretary who took power in November 2012, the case was seen as a barometer of how China’s new leadership — the first in a decade — would respond to organized calls for reform. Some liberal intellectuals and rights advocates initially hoped that Mr. Xi would be more tolerant than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, of mild campaigns for change. In 2012, Mr. Xu helped promote the New Citizens Movement, an organization that drew up to 5,000 members dedicated to fighting government graft and education policies restricting the children of rural migrants from attending big city schools. While many of the group’s activities involved informal discussions at restaurants across the country, some of its members took part in small street rallies in 2012 and early 2013 that unnerved the Communist Party leadership. Prosecutors claimed Mr. Xu was the “ringleader” of several protests in Beijing during which participants held aloft banners denouncing corruption or demanding an end to the nation’s discriminatory education policies. Other participants in the New Citizens Movement and similar protests also face prosecution, including two who stood trial in the two days after Mr. Xu’s trial. Four others face trial Monday in Beijing, according to Human Rights in China. Legal experts and human rights advocates described the prosecution of Mr. Xu as deeply flawed. His lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, whose testimony was submitted in writing only so they did not appear in court. Nor were the defense lawyers permitted to call in witnesses of their own. Advertisement Mr. Xu’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the legality of holding separate trials for the New Citizens Movement defendants in Beijing, a move they said prevented them from benefiting from testimony that could help in their defense. Mr. Zhang, one of his lawyers, called the trial last Wednesday “a piece of theater.” Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Mr. Xu’s slapdash prosecution and the sentence were designed to deter others seeking to agitate against the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. “It sends out the message that the law is essentially a tool for the party to rule the citizenry, not for the citizenry to curtail the power of the state,” he said. Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

Society   And Their Beat Goes On. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIJAN. 26, 2014 Margaret Mary Ocampo and Benjamin Paul Scheck were married Saturday at St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens. Msgr. Michael J. Brennan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. The bride, 26, teaches fourth grade at Public School 169 in the Bronx. She graduated magna cum laude from Queens College and received a master’s degree in the literacy specialist program at Columbia. She is a daughter of Monserrat M. Washburn of East Meadow, N.Y., and Jaime M. Ocampo of Queens Village. The groom, also 26, is a certified public accountant who works in Manhattan as an internal auditor with Advance Publications, a publisher of magazines and newspapers. He graduated from Baruch College, where he also received a master’s degree in taxation. He is the son of Angela Scheck and Robert I. Scheck of Flushing. The couple met in 2005 when they were high school seniors at St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. Advertisement “We sat across from each other in a computer class,” Mr. Scheck recalled. “I had never seen her before. I really wanted to get to know her.” Eventually he completed that assignment. “It took about a month; I had to build up a little courage,” he said. “She was a lot of fun, being with her just seemed right.” They were soon inseparable. “I liked the fact that we had a similar sense of humor,” Ms. Ocampo said. “We also both loved music; he was more a fan of classic rock and I liked classical and pop.” That shared love led to the creation of their rock band, Cover Fire, during their senior year in college. She is the lead singer. He plays bass guitar. “It’s still a lot of fun,” Ms. Ocampo said. On Nov. 22, 2012, Mr. Scheck proposed to Ms. Ocampo beneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. “I was taking photos and then I turned around to find him down on one knee,” she said. “At that point we had been going out for years and had been on so many trips together that I really didn’t expect anything. I was truly shocked.” VINCENT M. MALLOZZI A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page ST13 of the New York edition with the headline: And Their Beat Goes On.

Sports   Ducks Triumph at Dodger Stadium as Volleyballs and Frisbees Fly. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREN CROUSEJAN. 26, 2014 LOS ANGELES — Outdoor hockey, Southern California-style, debuted Saturday night with face-offs and Frisbees, spiked volleyballs and a stuffed penalty shot, Bob Miller partnering with Vin Scully and the iconoclastic pitcher Brian Wilson mingling with the icon Wayne Gretzky. The temperature at the start of the history-making game at Dodger Stadium between the Kings and the visiting Anaheim Ducks, rivals separated by 31 miles of interstate, was 61 degrees with a slight breeze. The balmy weather notwithstanding, it was easy to get the chills during the first regular-season outdoor hockey game in California, won by the Ducks in a 3-0 shutout. First there was a joint introduction by the Kings’ Miller and the Dodgers’ Scully, the city’s two legendary broadcasters. Then Gretzky performed the ceremonial opening puck drop, the only man for the honor given how he single-handedly made hockey cool in warm-weather cities. By the time the game started, the crowd of 54,099 was in full roar, with “Go Kings Go” cries followed by chants of “Beat L.A.” It was left to Jonas Hiller, the Ducks goaltender, to silence the Kings crowd, and he was more than up to the task. Hiller, who will represent Switzerland at next month’s Sochi Games, made 36 saves, including 20 in the opening 20 minutes, to leave his mark in the hallowed home of Koufax and Kershaw, where other visitors have included the Beatles and the Pope. Advertisement Corey Perry, who described the experience of playing outdoors as “getting back to your roots,” swept a loose puck past the Kings’ goaltender, Jonathan Quick, in the third minute for his 28th goal of the season. Matt Beleskey redirected the puck past Quick less than six minutes later. Collecting the second assist was Teemu Selanne, 43, who first graced a Ducks jersey in February of 1996, when Beleskey was 7. Asked if he enjoyed the game, Selanne said: “Absolutely. Way more than a normal game. It was a great experience.” For the Ducks, maybe. In the 10th minute, Anze Kopitar was awarded a penalty shot but he was stopped by Hiller. When Kopitar failed to score, the air went out of the lungs of the Kings fans. Anyone who follows the team knows well its recent struggles to put the puck in the net. In their last five games, all losses, the Kings have been outscored, 16-8. They haven’t scored since Kopitar’s goal in the fourth minute of their game Thursday against the Ducks in Anaheim. The puck at times bounced off players’ sticks like a bad grounder off a shortstop’s glove. The ice, while slushier than usual, was not terrible. Ben Lovejoy, the Ducks defenseman responsible for hooking Kopitar to set up the penalty shot, had described the ice as “good enough” after practicing on it Friday. On the eve of the game, Lovejoy said, “We might not want to skate on this ice 82 times a year, but for one night against the Kings in January this is going to be the best thing that’s happened to hockey in Southern California.” Since Gretzky, that is. The Battle at the Ballpark, as Miller coined it, was a spectacle that Gretzky built one point at a time during his eight years as the National Hockey League’s L.A.-based proselytizer of puck. He delivered everything to Southern California but the Stanley Cup, and since his retirement both the Kings and Ducks have taken care of that piece of unfinished business, with the Ducks winning the N.H.L. championship in 2007 and the Kings taking the title in 2012. “If somebody would tell me 10 years ago that we’re going to have an outdoor game here, that would really sound crazy,” Selanne said. “Everything is different now than it used to be. California has become a big hockey place.” Advertisement The rock band KISS, conceived in New York and commanded by Gene Simmons, performed before the game and during the first intermission. Five for Fighting — the rock band, not a group of Vancouver Canucks – performed in the second intermission. When the hockey stopped, the children’s bandy game and the adult beach volleyball matches began anew, headlined by Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who also happens to be a die-hard fan of the Dodgers’ big rivals, the San Francisco Giants. Other sports luminaries in attendance included Wilson, the Dodgers’ Mohawk-shorn pitcher, Yasiel Puig, Fernando Valenzuela and Tommy Lasorda. On this might it did not matter if you were a Dodger hater or a beloved former Dodger, a Ducks fan or a Kings fan, a hockey purist or an arriviste here to watch and be seen. What mattered was that on an unusually warm winter’s night, the beach balls and the Frisbees and the sand and the rock musicians were the side shows and the N.H.L., in a twist that would have been inconceivable a quarter of a century ago, was the main act.

Travel   Amy Tan’s Evolving Sense of China. Advertisement Advertisement By KENAN CHRISTIANSENJAN. 24, 2014 In 1949, Amy Tan’s mother boarded one of the last ships heading from Shanghai to San Francisco before “China became Red China and the bamboo curtain descended.” There, her mother reunited with her husband and the couple relocated to Oakland, where a couple of years later she was born. As a child, she knew little more about China than an “American pastiche of stereotypes,” and that some of her family had been lucky enough to make it out, while others had not. For years she organized her thinking around those divisions, until revelations about her family and the country her parents fled broke them down. Below are excerpts from correspondence with Ms. Tan, 61, whose latest novel is “The Valley of Amazement,” about how her relationship with China changed over time. Q. What were your earliest thoughts about China? A. Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, I thought of China as a prison that everyone wanted to escape. My parents considered themselves lucky that they were able to leave before 1949. Other family members were not quite as lucky and wound up in Formosa — that’s what we called Taiwan in those days. They sent us letters that described hard work and lack of proper food, hygiene and clothing. In their photos, they looked shockingly weathered and shiny with sweat. We received no letters from China and prayed for those silent ones whose whereabouts were unknown. If America was heaven, Formosa would be limbo, and China would be hell. Were you ever in contact with those family members before visiting?  When I was 16, after my father died, my mother told me that she had been married to another man in Shanghai before she met my father. I could hardly comprehend this stunning news, when she added she also had three daughters in China. She did not explain why they were in China, whereas she was in California. Years later she would only say that her previous husband had been a bad man. If I pressed her she would have said that I did not understand because I was an American. That was her typical lament when I did not seem to appreciate the tragedies of her life, like the suicide of her mother, which left her alone — abandoned, really — at the age of 9. She showed me their photos. The middle daughter, Jindo, was beautiful. She resembled my mother. She also fit the stereotype of peasants I had imagined in childhood. She wore a conical hat and farmer’s clothing, and she was standing next to a rice field. That could have been my life. Afterward, China was no longer an invisible jail. I now imagined myself living there, wearing a conical hat and writing letters late at night to my mother, in beautiful Chinese calligraphy like that of my newfound sisters. “I dream every day you will return,” Jindo had written her. “When you do, my happiness will be restored.” Advertisement Did she return? Yes, in 1979, after a 30-year separation, my mother went to visit her three daughters. Jindo lived in a village of rice farmers. She had married a surgeon, and they and several comrades served my mother a modest feast in a shack whose walls were lined with newspaper to keep out the cold. When was your first visit? In 1987, my mother, husband and I went together. We stepped out of the plane into an airport painted toothpaste green. I had assumed I would blend in with the masses. Instead, I was surrounded by locals who gawked at me and made open comments about my outlandish purple clothing. These days, I go about once a year. The most gleamingly modern airports I’ve been to are in China. The coolest and most technologically challenging hotel I’ve ever stayed in is in China. The most tricked-out hair salon I’ve been to is in China. The worst pollution I’ve endured is in China. I keep going back for more of the most. Not everyone wants to escape anymore. In fact, it is more often the case that Chinese students go to the U.S. to study and return to start companies and make millions. Has your attitude on China changed? I look at China not as a land of burdens and debt but the land of origin that gave our family its improbable history. I once traveled with Jindo on a long ferry ride to a mansion, the one on the island near Shanghai, where my mother grew up, where Jindo also grew up. I listened to her stories about working in the rice fields, where she wore the conical hat and danced and yelled as she pulled leeches off her calves. She eventually told me what happened to her after our mother left, about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father’s concubine. As Jindo re-enacted the past, she flung her arms and beat her chest, and it must have appeared that we were having a violent argument. “It was not right,” she said repeatedly, and she meant what her stepmother did to her, and also what her father did to our mother, and what my mother did in choosing to be with a lover rather than with her three daughters, and then in marrying that lover and having three children by him, one of them a daughter, who was sitting next to her, listening to her cry. An answer in the Q&A column on Jan. 26, in which the novelist Amy Tan discussed her relationship with China and how it has changed over time, referred incorrectly to a relative in China. Her half-sister married a surgeon, not a “barefoot doctor.” A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: Amy Tan Reflects on China and Uncovering Secrets of Her Origins.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

Sports   30 Seconds With Boomer Esiason. Advertisement Advertisement By JOE BRESCIAJAN. 27, 2014 After an all-American career at Maryland, Boomer Esiason played 14 seasons in the N.F.L. as a quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times and he was named the league’s most valuable player in 1988. Esiason ended his career with 2,969 completions, 5,205 pass attempts, a 57 percent completion mark , 247 touchdown passes and 37,920 yards passing. In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Business   Wheelies: The Detroit Rising Edition. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 28, 2014 A roundup of motoring news from the web: ■ This year’s Detroit auto show reported its highest attendance in more than 10 years. A total of 803,451 people visited the 2014 show — a significant one for General Motors, which took both the North American car and truck of the year awards. Attendance has not been that high since 838,066 people came to the show in 2003. (Jalopnik) ■ In its efforts to get people used to the idea that its new F-150 pickup trucks will be built with aluminum bodies, Ford told its dealers Sunday that the new trucks will actually be cheaper and easier to repair than the outgoing model. Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ BMW says that its all-electric i3 will arrive in American showrooms in May, priced similarly to the 3 Series. Ludwig Willisch, who heads BMW North America, said that the United States would be the company’s largest market for the i Series electric cars, adding that demand for the i3 will most likely outstrip supply in the first year of production. (Bloomberg) Advertisement ■ Volvo and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, of which Volvo is a subsidiary, will jointly develop a small car to compete with the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris and Volkswagen Polo, among others. Engineering work is to be done at a research and development center in Sweden, and Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo, told The Wall Street Journal that the car would be designed to compete in Western markets in a few years. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ After many races lost to teams with superior equipment, Scuderia Ferrari unveiled its new Formula One racecar on its website over the weekend. The F14 T drops last season’s 2.4-liter V8 in favor of a new turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 and features a lower nose cone and an improved energy recovery system. (CNN) ■ Ralph Marano, a noted Packard collector, is scheduled to take 10 one-of-a-kind Packards this year to the Amelia Island Concours d'Élégance. The show’s organizers agreed to create a class entirely for Mr. Marano’s unique collection of vehicles, which include the Vignale Packard and the Richard Arbib-designed Packard Pan America. (Hemmings Daily) ■ Nissan announced this week its plan to use a 400-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine that weighed only 88 pounds in its delta-shaped Le Mans racecar. Nissan claims the engine has a power-to-weight ratio of 10 horsepower per kilogram, which the automaker says is more potent than Formula One’s new 1.6-liter engines.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

Sports   30 Seconds With Boomer Esiason. Advertisement Advertisement By JOE BRESCIAJAN. 27, 2014 After an all-American career at Maryland, Boomer Esiason played 14 seasons in the N.F.L. as a quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times and he was named the league’s most valuable player in 1988. Esiason ended his career with 2,969 completions, 5,205 pass attempts, a 57 percent completion mark , 247 touchdown passes and 37,920 yards passing. In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back.

Foreign   A Dynast’s Flailing Makeover. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — In September, Rahul Gandhi, vice president of the Congress Party and scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, made an unannounced public appearance at a news conference in New Delhi. Minutes previously, Mr. Gandhi had called up Ajay Maken, the party’s general secretary, to ask him his whereabouts. Now, as Mr. Maken was defending a controversial government ordinance that prevented convicted politicians from being removed from office Mr. Gandhi seized the microphone. “I think the ordinance is complete nonsense,” he said. “It should be torn up and thrown away.” Mr. Gandhi’s outburst left Mr. Maken, and most senior leaders of the Congress Party, stunned. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, away in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly, had to face a public humiliation, hours before an important meeting with President Obama. It is inconceivable that the ordinance, which sparked an instant backlash from the media and the public, could have been passed without Mr. Gandhi’s knowledge. Yet, once he had taken note of the public mood, Mr. Gandhi seized the moment to engineer a shift in how he was seen by the Indian electorate. Mr. Gandhi, the ultimate insider in Indian politics, was now refashioning himself as an outside agent of change. That shift had been necessitated, in large part, by the steady and growing unpopularity of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. It is impossible to judge whether his outburst in September was an impulsive decision or a carefully calculated move. But it is clear that Mr. Gandhi increasingly feels the need to come across as accessible, articulate and decisive. His decision to subject himself to his first-ever television interview, with a popular network that aired the exchange Monday night, was a step in the same direction. Until his remarks in September, Mr. Gandhi had sought to cultivate the image of a leader who shunned public attention and preferred to work inconspicuously behind the scenes. In 2005, during an interview to the newsmagazine Tehelka, it was put to Mr. Gandhi that he asked few questions in Parliament. “I don’t ask questions in Parliament because I like to think things through,” he had replied. Mr. Gandhi portrayed himself as a politician unwilling to engage with the distracting minutiae of everyday politics. He was instead working on a grand design of resuscitating the Congress Party, democratizing the organization at the grass-roots and reinventing India’s oldest political party for the 21st century. It was an impression that Mr. Gandhi cultivated for much of his early years in politics. In the raucous and frenetic world of Indian politics, Mr. Gandhi remained ensconced in a long and seemingly intense silence. For fleeting observers of Indian democracy, it may have seemed that Mr. Gandhi alone was thinking about the great, profound and significant questions of our time. The thinking though was rarely, if ever, evident to his countrymen, to whom he remained little beyond an enigma. His thoughts on the most vexing questions of the day remained unrecorded for the electorate. But as long as the central government enjoyed some degree of modest popularity, Mr. Gandhi could always partake some of the credit, though his own contributions to policy making and other aspects of the government remained vague and undefined. A change in strategy became imperative once it became clear that it would be politically unwise for Mr. Gandhi, who was certain to lead the Congress Party into the next elections, to align himself too closely with a deeply unpopular government. His own failures in reviving the fortunes of the Congress in the key states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also meant that a new direction was needed to ignite Mr. Gandhi’s appeal for the electorate. Mr. Gandhi would have to be remade for public consumption, and so he began the process of fashioning himself as the crusading outsider last fall. Another factor, one outside Mr. Gandhi’s control, may have played a part too. In a country, where ideas of citizenship and egalitarian democracy are deepening, being the embodiment of dynastic and feudal privilege is a greater liability than ever before in Indian politics. In his televised interview on Monday night, Mr. Gandhi continued to play the crusader. He did not have a hunger for power, he asserted; instead he was in politics to “change the system.” Mr. Gandhi’s interview was, in many ways, a bumbling and bizarre performance. His depth of engagement with critical issues looked uncertain. Posed with specific questions, Mr. Gandhi repeatedly sought to seek refuge in vague, and seemingly rehearsed, generalities. When asked his views of Narendra Modi, the opposition’s candidate for prime minister, Mr. Gandhi responded, “What Rahul Gandhi wants to do, is Rahul Gandhi and millions of youngsters in this country want to change the way the system in this country works. What Rahul Gandhi wants to do is empower the women in this country, wants to unleash the power of these women, I mean we talk about being a superpower …” The interview also delineated the very real limits of Mr. Gandhi’s outsider act. When asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, after the assassination of his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and perpetrated under the watch of his father, Rajiv Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi sought to mount a dubious distinction between the pogrom in 1984 and the anti-Muslim riots of 2002 in Gujarat, which took place while Mr. Modi was chief minister of the state. Contrary to established evidence by independent human rights groups that indicts both governments of active collusion, Mr. Gandhi stated, “In 1984, the government was trying to stop the riots. In 2002, the government was actively aiding and abetting the riots.” If Mr. Gandhi had hoped to come across to undecided voters as the catalyst for change, he failed. But most alarmingly for supporters of the Congress Party, Mr. Gandhi’s interview revealed that despite a decade in politics, he had little to offer that was substantive and novel. Despite an active “rebranding” exercise, Mr. Gandhi reinforced the impression of a reluctant politician, inspired by little more than feudal obligation to carry forward the family business.

Foreign   British Nuclear Reprocessing Plant Detected Elevated Radiation Levels. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSJAN. 31, 2014 Elevated radiation levels detected Friday at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in northwestern England were caused by naturally occurring background radon, not by any faults at the aging plant, the operating company said. Only essential workers were asked to report for work as safety teams worked to pinpoint the cause of the elevated radiation, which was reported on one monitor at the plant — the largest nuclear site in Europe. Sellafield said its on-site monitors detected unusual activity overnight, leading it to reduce staffing levels on Friday as a precaution. “Following investigation and analysis, we can now confirm these levels to be naturally occurring background radon,” the company said. It said that there had been no risk to public safety and that the plant was never shut down. Nuclear reprocessing involves separating uranium and plutonium from nuclear waste for reuse as fuel, and treating the waste for storage.

Business   Richard Grossman, Crusading Publisher of 1960s, Dies at 92. Advertisement Advertisement By DOUGLAS MARTINFEB. 1, 2014 In the early 1960s, Richard Grossman, who died on Monday at 92, was a new publisher looking for a big book, and automobile safety appealed to him as a topic. He had been moved by an article on the subject in The New Republic. At the same time, a young lawyer named Ralph Nader, who had been studying car safety for several years, wanted to write a book in which he would contend that automakers had long put profits ahead of safety. One publisher, in rebuffing him, told him that such a book would interest only insurance adjusters. The journalist James Ridgeway, who had written the magazine article and who had used Mr. Nader as his principal source, brought Mr. Grossman and Mr. Nader together. They signed a contract that gave Mr. Nader a $3,000 advance. The deal resulted in “Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-in Dangers of the American Automobile,” published in 1965, which helped jump-start the modern consumer movement, much as Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” ignited environmentalism in 1962. The book — named, edited and promoted by Mr. Grossman — maintained that a compact car, the Chevrolet Corvair, made by General Motors, had “designed-in” features that made it prone to spills and rollovers. Its larger message, Justin Martin wrote in “Nader: Crusader, Spoiler, Icon” (2002), was that “unaccountable forces — the auto industry in this case — made decisions that affect the lives of individual citizens.” Mr. Nader was even blunter in a telephone interview on Friday. He said the book “showed the cruelty of the modern corporation.” Richard Lee Grossman was born in Chicago on June 26, 1921, and moved to New York City as a child. He was a pre-med student at the University of Pennsylvania for two years, then transferred to City College in New York, where he studied religion for a year before dropping out, unable to afford to continue his studies. Advertisement He served in the Army Signal Corps in the Pacific during World War II, earning a bronze star and attaining the rank of captain. After his discharge, he worked in a department store in Canton, Ohio, then started an advertising agency there and began writing an advertising column for a home furnishings magazine published by Fairchild Publications. A family connection later landed him a job at the publishing house Simon & Schuster, where he rose to vice president. He founded his own concern, Grossman Publishers, in 1962 in a basement apartment in Manhattan. He and Mr. Nader met there to iron out their contract. Mr. Nader rushed to finish the book in advance of the congressional hearings on car safety that he had agitated for, and he and Mr. Grossman met at a Washington motel to edit the book. Mr. Grossman set up two typewriters side by side in the room. As soon as Mr. Nader finished a page, he would hand it to Mr. Grossman for editing. Working day and night, they finished the book in 22 days. Mr. Grossman’s publicity campaign for “Unsafe at Any Speed” culminated in a news conference with Mr. Nader at the Sheraton Cadillac Hotel in Detroit, the site chosen because G.M. made Cadillacs. It proved to be a publicity masterstroke: the heads of car companies who had been invited did not show, conspicuously so, and Mr. Nader put on a deft performance parrying hostile questions from the trade press. The first 9,000 copies of the book, published on Nov. 30, 1965, sold out, and by March almost 22,000 copies had been purchased. But it did not become a best seller until news reports revealed that G.M. had hired investigators to try to collect dirt on Mr. Nader. At a Senate hearing on March 22, 1966, James M. Roche, the chairman of G.M., apologized to Mr. Nader for what he called “harassment.” That September, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which set safety standards for cars and roads. Advertisement Mr. Grossman went on to publish books by Mr. Nader and his associates on air and water pollution, food and drugs, pesticides and coal-mine safety, all of which helped lead to the passage of major legislation. He also published literary books, including “84 Charing Cross Road,” Helene Hanff’s 1970 bestseller about her 20-year correspondence with the chief clerk of an antiquarian bookstore in London. (A film version starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins was released in 1987.) He published a half-dozen books by Louis Zukofsky, an American Jewish poet known for vivid verses inspired by Manhattan’s Lower East Side. In 1971, he published “Scorpion,” a novel by Albert Memmi set in the author’s native Tunis. Among the company’s nonfiction titles was ”Dallas Public and Private: Aspects of an American City,” Warren Leslie’s portrayal of right-wing extremism in Dallas at the time of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination. Mr. Grossman sold his business to Viking in 1968. A man of many interests, he became a psychotherapist, with offices in Manhattan and Salisbury, Conn.; an authority on alternative medicine; and a published expert on Ralph Waldo Emerson. His book “Choosing and Changing: A Guide to Self-Reliance” (1978) gave advice on midlife career changes. His “A Year With Emerson: A Daybook” (2003) offers daily almanac entries of Emerson’s wisdom. Mr. Grossman died in Salisbury. His wife, the author Ann Arensberg, said the cause was leukemia. His marriages to Elizabeth Heiden and Jill Kneerim ended in divorce. Besides his wife, Mr. Grossman is survived by his daughters, Joan Grossman, Nancy Nagle and Lucy Rochambeau. One story he liked to tell about his publishing days concerned a visit to the photographer Richard Avedon at his home on the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He found Mr. Avedon crying. “Where are your 35-millimeter cameras?” he said to Mr. Avedon, who was best known for his fashion work. “Get out on the streets immediately.” The haunted faces of grief that Mr. Avedon shot that day are considered some of his most moving work. Advertisement Mr. Grossman himself was photographed, anonymously, for the cover of one edition of “The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit,” Sloan Wilson’s best-selling 1955 novel about a soulless business culture in postwar America. Jonathan Schwartz, the radio personality and a friend of Mr. Grossman’s, wrote in an email, “His pose was jaunty — the perfect suit with his back to the camera.” A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2014, on page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Richard Grossman, 92, Crusading Publisher of 1960s.

Foreign   In Our Pages: February 3. Advertisement   VIENNA— The most extraordinary rumors are still circulating as to Prince Rudolf’s death, and almost every hour a new sensational story is told, not only about the terrible event, but also prominent persons who are believed to have some connection with the Meierling tragedy. Thus, for example, there are people who profess to have positive information that Prince Schwarzenberg has committed suicide, while others say that it is not he, but Prince Auersberg who has made away with himself. Others again talk significantly about the disappearance of a certain beautiful Baroness W— , whom no one has seen since Tuesday. But few people give any credence to the official version of the Archduke’s death. I am assured that the autopsy does not make any mention of the cerebral lesions. It is probable that this document will not be made public, and that the details of the drama will never be made known officially. I give you all this gossip for what it is worth. As a matter of fact, none of them are half so important as the serious political difficulties of the situation. Such great hopes were entertained for the future of the dead Prince that everything the Archduke Francis Ferdinand does is misinterpreted. There is, however, no truth in the assertion that there will be any trouble as to the succession to the Hungarian Crown. 1939: Guillotiner of 40 Years Dies Suddenly in Paris The humble bourgeois-appearing man had been responsible for no less than 400 deaths in the last forty years. PARIS — A sad-faced little man wearing a white goatee and neat black clothes staggered among the crowd in the Porte de Saint- Cloud Métro station Wednesday night [Jan. 31] , and suddenly sprawled out on the floor dead. No one who witnessed the accident realized that the humble bourgeois-appearing man had been responsible for no less than 400 deaths in the last forty years. It was only as he was being rushed to a hospital that attendants searching his pockets for identity papers discovered that he was that sinister personage known as ‘‘Monsieur de Paris’’ —otherwise Anatole Deibler, last of the dynasty that has held the position of official guillotiner in France for 120 years. To one man in France, M. Deibler’s death — caused by congestion due to the cold — brought temporary relief. He was Maurice Pilorge, who was due to have his head chopped off in Rennes at dawn this morning for the murder of a Mexican named Escudero at Din- ard. M. Deibler was on his way to the Ministry of Justice to obtain the execution order and collect his expenses when he died.

Travel   Security Concerns on a Honduran Island. Advertisement Advertisement By DAVE SEMINARAJAN. 31, 2014 Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world, but the country’s idyllic Bay Islands have long been considered a safe haven, largely immune from the drug-fueled violence that has plagued the Honduran mainland. However, a string of recent crimes on Roatán, the largest of the Bay Islands, has prompted outrage, with some residents calling for greater autonomy and more effective policing for the islands. Roatán made international headlines on Dec. 22 when Nedenia Post Dye, the great-granddaughter of the General Foods heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, was found stabbed to death in her luxury spa on the island. A local singer whom she was reportedly trying to help has been charged with her murder; he claims the two were romantically linked. “People let their guard down here because it’s beautiful and relaxing,” said Aaron Etches, a longtime resident of Roatán who founded a Facebook group called Roatán Crime Watch about a year ago in the wake of several high-profile crimes as a way to help fight crime on the island. The group has more than 2,000 members, and in the last month, users have reported a host of robberies, including a Jan. 2 incident in which an armed bandit fired a shot at an American family who were visiting Roatán for the day on the Carnival Conquest and robbed them in broad daylight close to the Palm Beach Resort. “People told us things like this don’t usually happen on Roatán, but it’s a dangerous place,” said Jeff Smith, a pilot for Delta Air Lines who was in the vehicle along with his wife and three young daughters. Advertisement Despite the recent reports of incidents, Robert Armstrong, a former Foreign Service officer who is the editor of Bay Islands Voice, an English-language magazine based in Roatán, said that according to the local police, there were 17 homicides on the island in the first eight months of 2013, none involving tourists, compared with nine during the same period in 2012. “The crime rate here is much lower than on the mainland, but the gap is closing,” he said. A spokesperson for Carnival said Roatán had historically been a safe destination since the line started calling there in 2009. The State Department updated its travel warning for Honduras on Dec. 24, cautioning that the “level of crime and violence in Honduras remains critically high.” The warning didn’t specifically address crime in Roatán but it noted that members of the Honduran National Police were known to engage in criminal activity and had solved just two of the 50 murders committed against United States citizens in the country since 2008. Karol Escalante, a spokeswoman for the Embassy of Honduras in Washington, said incidents of crime against tourists were rare and maintained that the government was beefing up security in tourist destinations like Roatán. (She claimed that crime decreased at the national level in 2013 but had no figures for Roatán.) Mr. Etches said that business owners have formed watch committees and are preparing to install more security cameras around the island. Amy Robertson, author of the Moon Handbook to Honduras and the Bay Islands, said she believed that Roatán is still a safe destination, but cautioned that visitors should check with locals before venturing to the far east end of the island past the town of Oak Ridge. Expatriates who live on Roatán advise visitors not to walk alone on the stretch of beach between West Bay and West End and to avoid Coxen Hole after dark. Mr. Armstrong said that visitors should stick to the island’s main road unless they were with a group. “Stay on the paved roads, be aware that there is a different threat level here than you’re used to at home, and don’t carry a lot of cash and valuables with you,” he said.

Business   Closing Arguments in Martoma Trial. Advertisement   The prosecutor, Eugene Ingoglia, an assistant United States attorney, told the jury that to find his canary, Mr. Martoma built up relationships with two doctors involved in the drug trial, which was run by Elan and Wyeth. These relationships “paid off in the most dramatic way” when Mr. Martoma used the information to trade before Elan announced its negative trial results, a move that eventually led SAC to avoid losses and make profits totaling $275 million, Mr. Ingoglia said. But the defense asserted that the government’s case against Mr. Martoma was “fatally flawed” because it hinged on testimony from a doctor and his “totally unbelievable” memory. Mr. Martoma’s case follows the conviction of another top SAC portfolio manager, Michael S. Steinberg, and is at the heart of the government’s decade-long investigation into SAC, which has resulted in six former employees pleading guilty to insider trading charges. In November, SAC itself pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine. The courtroom on Monday was so packed with spectators wanting to hear the closing arguments that nearly two dozen people had to stand against the wall. Two prosecutors who won the Steinberg case were among those in the audience. The jury is expected to start deliberating on Tuesday. During the four-week trial, the two doctors, Joel S. Ross and Sidney Gilman, testified that they had given Mr. Martoma inside information about the drug trial, breaching their confidentiality agreements with Elan and Wyeth. Both doctors have signed nonprosecution agreements with the government that give them immunity as long as they testify truthfully. Dr. Gilman, 81, a former University of Michigan professor who was chairman of the safety committee during the drug trial, at times showed signs of a faltering memory during the five days he took the witness stand. Prosecutors used emails, electronic calendar entries and phone logs to help bolster his testimony. “He’s not remembering, he’s creating,” Richard Strassberg, the defense counsel, told the jury on Monday. Dr. Gilman testified that he gave Mr. Martoma the final results of the trial on July 17, 2008, hours after he received it himself and weeks before it was made public. Two days later, Mr. Martoma flew to Ann Arbor, Mich., to visit him and take a look at the data himself, Dr. Gilman testified. The morning after his trip, Mr. Martoma made a 20-minute call to Steven A. Cohen, the founder of SAC. The next day SAC began to liquidate its $700 million positions in Elan and Wyeth shares, a full week before Elan announced the results of the trial. Those results surprised investors, sending shares in both Elan and Wyeth plummeting on the news. But Dr. Gilman told the jury that it was only days before the trial that he remembered the details of the meeting with Mr. Martoma. Mr. Strassberg told the jury that he did not dispute the facts of Mr. Martoma’s trip, or the emails, calendar entries and phone calls showing the two spoke frequently. But, he told the jury, he was concerned that Dr. Gilman’s recollection of the details of what actually happened was faulty. Dr. Gilman also worked as a paid consultant for Gerson Lehrman, a network that connected industry experts with hedge funds like SAC. At one particularly interesting moment during the four-week trial, a star witness testified that F.B.I. agents had told him that he was “just a grain of sand, as is Mr. Martoma. They are really after a man named Steven A. Cohen.” On Monday, Mr. Strassberg told the jury that Mr. Martoma “is not a grain of sand; he is not a means to make a case against Steve Cohen.” Mr. Cohen has not been criminally charged, but he faces civil administrative charges for failing to supervise. “Mathew’s life is on the line,” Mr. Strassberg told the jury, wrapping up his three-hour summation. As he paused to look at the jurors, Mr. Martoma’s wife, Rosemary, seated in the gallery just behind him, began to cry. During the government’s rebuttal, a federal prosecutor, Arlo Devlin-Brown, addressed Mr. Strassberg’s contention that Dr. Gilman had lied about passing on inside information to Mr. Martoma. He asked the jurors to consider why Dr. Gilman would lie about giving secret information to Mr. Martoma. As he finished, Mr. Devlin-Brown told the jurors that Dr. Gilman lying about his involvement in Mr. Martoma’s case “would be one of the craziest things for someone to do.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/04/2014, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Closing Arguments in Martoma Trial.

Foreign   North Korea Agrees to Talks on Reunions. Advertisement Advertisement By CHOE SANG-HUNFEB. 3, 2014 SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea agreed on Monday to hold border talks with South Korea this week to discuss arranging reunions where relatives separated by the Korean War would meet for the first time in six decades, officials here said. North Korea agreed last month to restart the reunions after a three-year hiatus and asked South Korea to pick the dates. Last Monday, the South suggested that the reunions be held from Feb. 17 to 22 and that the two sides hold Red Cross talks on the border last Wednesday to sort out the details. Despite the South’s repeated appeals, however, the North did not respond for a week. On Monday, it said such talks could be held Wednesday or Thursday. “We welcome the North Korean response, even if it is belated,” Kim Eui-do, a spokesman for the South Korean government, said at a media briefing on Monday. South Korea had hoped to hold the Red Cross talks last week to allow the Koreas time to prepare for the reunions before the South and the United States begin joint annual military exercises scheduled for late February. North Korea has denounced the drills for being what it says are a rehearsal for an invasion, and has used such exercises as a reason to scuttle or delay family reunions. Advertisement North Korea announced last month that it was ready to hold the reunions after South Korea repeatedly urged it to prove in “action” that it was serious about recent proposals by its leader, Kim Jong-un, to improve ties with the South. Mr. Kim called for better relations in his New Year’s Day speech. But Seoul and Washington feared that the North’s latest charm offensive might be a deceptive prelude to a new round of military provocations. Millions of Koreans were separated from relatives when a cease-fire ended the Korean War in 1953, with the peninsula still divided after three years of war. No exchanges of letters, telephone calls or emails between the relatives have been allowed since. Family reunions remain a highly emotional issue and a barometer of political relations. About 22,000 Koreans participated in 18 rounds of government-arranged reunions from 1985 to 2010, when the program was suspended. About 73,000 South Koreans, half of them older than 80, remain on a waiting list to meet their relatives in the North for the first time since the war. After months of harsh talk after the North’s nuclear test last February, the Koreas agreed in August to revive the reunions. The South selected 100 people by lottery to participate. Two have since died. A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2014, on page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: North Korea Agrees to Talks on Reunions.

Business   Google Gives Eric Schmidt $100 Million in Stock. Advertisement   The cash bonus is “in recognition of his contributions to Google’s performance in fiscal year 2013,” the company said in a regulatory filing. In 2013, Google shares climbed 55 percent and joined the $1,000 club. The large payment package came as the European Union is expected to announce a settlement with Google to end a three-year antitrust investigation — a deal in which Mr. Schmidt has been highly involved, even exchanging text messages with Joaquin Almunia, the European competition commissioner. Mr. Schmidt’s compensation also follows a decision by Google’s board to allow Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, to cement their voting power over the company by creating a new class of shares. The $100 million in restricted stock units will vest over four years. It comes on top of another $100 million stock award the company gave Mr. Schmidt in 2011, soon after it announced that Mr. Page would replace Mr. Schmidt as chief executive. Mr. Page, meanwhile, earns $1 a year in salary (though he is worth $25 billion, largely in Google stock, according to Forbes.) Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »

Foreign   Initial Autopsy Shows Arunachal Pradesh Student Had Head Injuries, Uncle Says. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — Initial autopsy results show that Nido Tania, an 18-year-old student from the northeast who was allegedly beaten by shopkeepers in south Delhi last week, had head injuries and brain swelling before he died, Mr. Tania’s uncle told India Ink on Tuesday. Nido Jose Apil was briefed by the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital on Thursday after the autopsy was completed. “The doctor told us that there were abrasions on the head, face and neck and minor internal bleeding in the neck,” he said. “Doctors also reported the swelling of the brain.” The initial report also found an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the lungs caused a blockage of the respiratory system, which led to the young man’s death, Mr. Apil said. The final autopsy report, which includes the toxicology results, is expected later this week. The Delhi police have filed an initial complaint in the case, and on Monday, the police said they had arrested three men; identified only as Farman, 22, Sunder, 27 and Pawan, 27. Mr. Tania’s death has led to widespread protests by youths from the northeast, who denounced what they described as a “race crime.” Northeastern Indians often have East Asian features. Mr. Tania, son of a state legislator in Arunachal Pradesh, was in the Lajpat Nagar area to visit a friend, and had approached the shopkeepers at a dairy shop for directions. The shopkeepers are accused of making fun of his hairstyle and using a derogative term for East Asians, which led to a confrontation, during which Mr. Tania broke the glass of a display case at the shop. The Delhi police were called and took all parties to the station, where they brokered an agreement that Mr. Tania would pay for the damage. What happened next is in dispute. In an interview with India Ink on Saturday, Nido Pavitra, the teenager’s father, said his son described being dropped off near the store by the police and being severely beaten by the shopkeepers. The shopkeepers’ neighbors deny that any violent attack occurred. Mr. Tania was found dead in his home a day after the altercation. Mr. Pavitra lay the blame squarely on the Delhi police for failing to protect his son. He took Mr. Tania’s body to his home village in Arunachal Pradesh on Saturday. The case has spurred the authorities into action. A magisterial inquiry was announced by the Delhi state government on Friday, and on Monday, the Delhi High Court ordered the central and state governments and the Delhi Police Department to report on the actions they take in the case. Protests continued in the capital this week. On Monday, Rahul Gandhi, the vice president of the Congress Party, joined protesters who had gathered in Jantar Mantar in central Delhi, and expressed solidarity with their cause. “There is only one India which matters to me — that is an India where every single person has respect, justice and is treated fairly,” he told the demonstrators. Mr. Gandhi promised strong action against Mr. Tania’s attackers and the formation of a committee to study the issues faced by Indians from the northeast. Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, arrived at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday and declared that he would ensure justice for the teenager. Mr. Kejriwal said that the inquiry he ordered last week would be completed in three to four weeks and that action would be taken against any police official found to be at fault. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Itanagar, the capital of Arunachal Pradesh, Marina Nido, Mr. Tania’s mother, said her son paid 10,000 rupees, or $160, to the shopkeepers as compensation for the damage to their property, settling the matter. Like Mr. Tania’s father, she said the police were at fault for bringing her son back to the area near the store, where she said he was violently beaten. Ms. Nido also recounted her experiences with Indians who made her feel like an outsider. In their home state of Arunachal Pradesh, she said, when government officials and businessmen from Delhi visited for work or vacation, they were welcomed and treated with respect. By contrast, Ms. Nido said, when she lived outside the northeast region, she was asked by other Indians,“Are you from China, Korea?” India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president.

Science   Blazing Trails in Brain Science. Advertisement Advertisement Profiles in Science By BENEDICT CAREY FEB. 3, 2014 BETHESDA, Md. — The police arrived at the house just after breakfast, dressed in full riot gear, and set up a perimeter at the front and back. Not long after, animal rights marchers began filling the street: scores of people, young and old, yelling accusations of murder and abuse, invoking Hitler, as neighbors stepped out onto their porches and stared. It was 1997, in Decatur, Ga. The demonstrators had clashed with the police that week, at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center at nearby Emory University, but this time, they were paying a personal call — on the house of the center’s director, inside with his wife and two teenage children. “I think it affected the three of them more than it did me, honestly,” said Dr. Thomas R. Insel, shaking his head at the memory. “But the university insisted on moving all of us to a safe place for a few days, to an ‘undisclosed location.’ “I’ll say this. I learned that if you’re going to take a stand, you’re going to make some people really angry — so you’d better believe in what you’re doing, and believe it completely.” For the past 11 years, Dr. Insel, a 62-year-old brain scientist, has run an equally contentious but far more influential outfit: the National Institute of Mental Health, the world’s leading backer of behavioral health research. Advertisement The job comes with risk as well as power. Patient groups and scientists continually question the agency’s priorities, and politicians occasionally snipe at its decisions. Two previous directors resigned in the wake of inflammatory statements (one on marijuana laws, one comparing urban neighborhoods to jungles), and another stepped down after repeatedly objecting to White House decisions. Dr. Insel has not merely survived; he is the longest-serving director since Dr. Robert H. Felix, the agency’s founder, retired almost a half-century ago. His tenure stretches over three presidencies and, more important, coincides with a top-down overhaul in the substance and direction of behavioral science. The extent of this remodeling is not widely understood outside scientific circles nor universally appreciated within them. But in recent months, its author has begun to reveal his instincts publicly, in blog posts and speeches. Last summer, he questioned whether people with schizophrenia should remain indefinitely on antipsychotic medications — a shot at accepted medical wisdom. A few months earlier, he had called out psychiatry’s diagnostic encyclopedia, the D.S.M.-5, as “not scientifically valid,” weeks before a new edition was released. Psychiatrists were not happy, and they told him so. Days later, he issued a statement saying that the manual was the best “currently available,” if imperfect. For anyone with a psychiatric diagnosis, or a family member with one, Dr. Insel’s long, twisting career and the convictions it has fostered provide a guided tour through behavior science: where it has been, where it’s going and why. The story is neither predictable nor probable, at least by the standards of Washington officialdom. It is less a tale of perseverance than one of restless curiosity — of ascending the trail by straying off it, repeatedly and without approval. The Young Doctor The first time he walked away was from premedical studies. Dr. H. Herman Insel, an eye surgeon in Dayton, Ohio, and his wife, Ruth, a social worker, were determined that all four of their boys get a medical education, and the first three went fairly smoothly. The last one out of the house, the Eagle Scout who collected insects and snakes and filled the basement with aquariums, was ahead of the program, if anything. At the age of 15, Tom Insel had entered the prestigious six-year B.A.-M.D. program at Boston University. But two years in, the boy wanted out. He decided it was time to step off the treadmill and see the world. Advertisement “My father didn’t want me going anywhere, and I was too young to be drafted for Vietnam,” Dr. Insel said in a recent interview at his office here. “I told him, ‘O.K., so how about I go to Hanoi? They could use some help there.’ ” The two reached a compromise, and the son spent six months backpacking around the world, stopping to work in a tuberculosis clinic in Hong Kong and at a mission hospital in Bihar, India. The experiences brought him full circle, back to medicine and to Boston, where he completed the M.D. program in 1974. “I was sure I was going to be a doctor of global health or tropical medicine in some underdeveloped country,” he said. Instead, he found an untamed world closer to home: psychiatry, which in the 1970s was ruled by a cabal of Freudian theorists and lacked a scientific infrastructure. After a graduate course at Stanford, followed by an internship and residency in psychiatry, he landed a position in the mental health institute’s in-house research branch, known as the intramural program. There he embarked on another kind of walkabout, this time studying the effect of an early antidepressant drug in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In a series of studies, he and a senior colleague, Dr. Dennis Murphy, showed that the drug soothed people’s symptoms within weeks, much faster than standard psychotherapy. The results had the opposite effect on many old-school psychiatrists. “Obsessive-compulsive neurosis,” as it was known then, was a specialty of Freudian analysts, and here was some upstart barely out of school saying he’d discovered a better, faster form of treatment. Advertisement He wasn’t yet 30 years old. “I don’t think it helped that I still looked like I was 17,” Dr. Insel said. The pendulum has swung so far toward drug therapy in recent years that it is hard to recapture how disruptive those 1980s studies were. Dr. Insel’s work and that of many others, testing the effect of new medications, would turn the field away from long-term talking cures and increasingly toward medication and short-term behavior therapies rooted in the same kind of randomized, controlled trials conducted in other fields of medicine. (Today, psychiatrists often treat O.C.D. with short-term cognitive therapy, complemented by antidepressant medication.) Any young investigator at the forefront of such a shift was bound to feel a professional updraft, and Dr. Insel was soon fielding offers from universities trying to build a psychiatric research department. Advertisement At an age when most young scientists are scrambling for a foothold, a mentor and a viable project, his path was all but set. He and his wife, Deborah, a writer, had two young children and every reason to grab for longer-term stability. Instead, they passed. Again, Dr. Insel abandoned course in midstride, taking a year’s sabbatical to study basic neuroscience. “I just wanted to try something else,” he said. “I got bored, that’s really what it was.” The Biology of Love He also lost his job. In 1985, returning to the mental health institute after his year away, he began studying tiny mouselike rodents called voles in an effort to understand the biology of attachment. This project was a long way from O.C.D., and to many others in the field, it seemed like the brain-science equivalent of backpacking to Hanoi. “No one told me at the time that it was pointless to try to reduce a complex social behavior like pair bonding to neural biology, so I didn’t know any better,” Dr. Insel said. “I just assumed we could do it and started looking for the best model.” He settled on voles for a good reason. One species, the prairie vole, is monogamous; it forms long-term pair bonds after mating. Another, the montane vole, is polygamous; it mates and moves on. The two species are closely related, so the difference in their behavior might be rooted in some discrete neural process that could be isolated, Dr. Insel argued. In a series of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his team showed just that: Injections of a protein called vasopressin induced monogamous bonding in male prairie voles even when the animals didn’t mate. Likewise, blocking the action of the protein prevented the post-mating bond that usually formed. Injections of the hormone oxytocin prompted similar bonding instincts in female prairie voles. In a paper published in the journal Nature in 1993, Dr. Insel’s group reported that vasopressin is “both necessary and sufficient for selective aggression and partner preference formation, two critical features of pair bonding in the monogamous prairie vole.” Advertisement The paper was widely reported, and again put the mental health institute in the vanguard of a new area of research. But the agency was changing emphasis, phasing out its research into social behaviors. Dr. Michael Brownstein, the scientific director at the time, politely instructed his young research star to find another project — or another job. (The two are now good friends.) He chose Door No. 2, and it took all of three months. Emory University was looking to replace the director of the Yerkes primate center, who was about to retire, and Dr. Insel was at the top of their list. He had already run a lab, as chief of the neurobiology division of the mental health institute, and his work with voles would diversify Yerkes’s portfolio, which then was focused on studying H.I.V. in primates. He packed up his family and his voles, and moved south. “Acclaimed Researcher to Head Yerkes Center,” read the headline in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Aug. 20, 1994, the day the hiring was announced. “All I know is I had to go out and buy my first tie,” is how Dr. Insel tells it. He quickly expanded rodent research at the center and also deepened his own work on the biology of attachment, with the help of an Emory postdoctoral student, Larry Young, who has since extended the research on his own. The work with voles effectively scotched the assumption that a complex behavior could not be reduced to brain biology. Oxytocin and vasopressin are now a focus of intense interest as possible modulators of social behaviors in other species, though the effects of such proteins are still a matter of debate. His necktie came in handy at Yerkes. Between the march on his home in Decatur and other crises, the “psychiatrist who became a bench scientist,” as he has described himself, took on yet another role: He became a public official. He was comfortable in front of audiences, relaxed with the news media, and willing to see at-home protests as part of the job, nothing to lose sleep over. The precociousness was long gone. By 2000, he had some well-tailored suits to go with his ties, a commanding view over his field, and some strong beliefs about how to improve its infrastructure. All of which made him “the natural choice” for the mental health institute’s director, in the words of Dr. Elias Zerhouni, then director of National Institutes of Health who hired him for the job in 2002, citing his “ability to communicate a compelling vision for mental health research, his outstanding scientific record, and his proven leadership skills.” The Path Ahead In one way, it was a homecoming, a return to Washington and to the National Institute of Mental Health, where he’d made a name for himself. In a more consequential sense, however, Dr. Insel’s arrival as director signaled yet another departure, this one far larger than just about anyone could have anticipated. Dr. Insel has sharply shifted the agency’s focus — to basic neuroscience and genetics, at the expense of the very type of behavioral research he himself had once done. That change has generated a mix of optimism and outrage. Advertisement “I met Tom when he came in, and my expectations were low,” said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, of the Stanley Medical Research Institute, a nonprofit supporting research in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and a longtime critic of the mental health institute. “He was a bench scientist, and I frankly doubted that he had the political skills to be an effective director or had a strong commitment to serious mental illness. “I was wrong on both counts. I think he’s the best director we’ve had.” Others strongly disagree. “Instead of being an institute of mental health, he has made it almost exclusively a brain research institute,” Dr. Allen Frances, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Duke and the author of the book “Saving Normal,” wrote in an email. “N.I.M.H. is betting the house on the long shot that neuroscience will come up with answers to help people with serious mental illness.” He added, “It does little or no psychosocial or health services research that might relieve the current suffering of patients.” Dr. Insel says the agency does in fact support some psychosocial research — testing new services for people with schizophrenia, for instance — but does not deny that its primary mission is biological. Still, he has generally been spared such sharp public criticism, perhaps because many have confused a reflexively earnest good nature with an easily compromising one. “He’s been able to use the bully pulpit without being a bully, without being offensive,” said Dr. Steven E. Hyman of the Broad Institute at M.I.T. and Harvard. Dr. Hyman was Dr. Insel’s predecessor as director of the mental health institute; the two share most scientific instincts and speak regularly. “It’s not something I was particularly good at,” he went on. “They kept giving me media training, and it never stuck.” That open-minded nature can mask two stubborn convictions. One is that the previous generation of biological research in psychiatry has been largely a disappointment, both in advancing basic science and in improving lives. Yes, the revolution in pharmacology (in which he played a role) gave doctors more drugs to use, allowing millions of people to reduce their symptoms. Yet the overall impact of this drug revolution on public health has been mixed, and decades of research on the drugs’ mechanisms — on serotonin, for example, the target of antidepressant drugs like Prozac — has taught scientists nothing about the causes of mental illness. The same is true of most research using “animal models,” in which scientists try to create psychiatric problems in animals and study them. Advertisement “We’ve had this huge increase in the use of all interventions, a 250 percent increase in use of antipsychotics, without any change in the morbidity or mortality in people with mental disorders; it hasn’t budged,” Dr. Insel said. “If that were the case for cancer, there’d be an outcry for more research, money and new priorities.” In a blog post in August, he questioned the wisdom of long-term drug treatment for people with schizophrenia, writing, “We need to ask whether in the long term some individuals with a history of psychosis may do better off medication.” The post became an overnight sensation among patient advocates who had been making the same case for decades. His second stubborn conviction is that the only way to build a real psychiatric science is from first principles — from genes and brain biology, as opposed to identifying symptom clusters. Some of the mental health institute’s largest outlays under Dr. Insel have been to support projects that, biologically speaking, are like mapping the ocean floor. One is the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, a far-flung group of top research centers that share data and analysis, based at the lab of Dr. Patrick F. Sullivan at the University of North Carolina. The other is the Human Connectome Project, a $40 million, five-year program to build a baseline database for brain structure and activity using M.R.I. imaging. In April, when in a blog post Dr. Insel wrote that the D.S.M.-5, was “at best a dictionary” and lacked scientific validity, he wasn’t exaggerating for effect. He had to qualify his comments because he doesn’t yet have a replacement. But he is determined to remake psychiatric diagnosis entirely and has set up an alternative framework for doing so, called the Research Domain Criteria — RDoC, for short — to be built from the ground up, on genetic findings. “My philosophy is really based on humility,” he said. “I don’t think we know enough to fix either diagnostics or therapeutics. The future of psychiatry is clinical neuroscience, based on a much deeper understanding of the brain.” That future may feel too far away for many patients, as well as many scientists. But this is one path Dr. Insel is not likely to wander from, no matter who disapproves.

Foreign   Protests over Creation of Telangana Disrupt 1st Day of 2014 Parliament Session. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — The Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, spent a total of nearly one hour in session during its first day back from the winter break before protests by Andhra Pradesh lawmakers, who were upset over a plan to create the state of Telangana, forced an early adjournment. The session started smoothly enough at 11 a.m., with lawmakers standing silent as the speaker read out the names of former parliamentarians who had died. But soon afterward, the Andhra Pradesh lawmakers, whose state will be divided in two by the Telangana plan being pushed by the governing Congress Party, began yelling, “Jai Samaikya Andhra!” (Hail United Andhra) Even some members of the Congress Party who favor an undivided Andhra Pradesh joined in. Unable to cut through the cacophony, the Lok Sabha speaker, Meira Kumar, announced the adjournment of the house until noon. When Lok Sabha resumed proceedings at noon, in addition to the bickering over Telangana, opposition lawmakers began talking about Nido Tania, a student from Arunachal Pradesh who died after what some say was a racially motivated attack in New Delhi. Sushma Swaraj, a senior Parliament leader from the Bharatiya Janata Party, raised her voice above the din to criticize Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, and Rahul Gandhi, the vice president of the Congress Party, for spending time with protesters in central Delhi rather than working on a plan to protect students in the capital. “I urge the government to create more student hostels in Delhi so that students from the northeast can live amicably with those from other states of the country,” said Ms. Swaraj. As the Andhra Pradesh lawmakers kept yelling, Ms. Kumar decided to end the session early at 12:30 p.m. The same raucous scenes played out in the Rajya Sabha, or the upper house of Parliament, as well. After beginning the session at 11 a.m., the Rajya Sabha adjourned after 40 minutes until 2 p.m. When the Rajya Sabha resumed its work, Kapil Sibal, the law minister, moved a bill that defines the role of state and central governments in quelling religious violence, officially putting the legislation on the agenda. But opposition lawmakers began shouting their objections, saying that the bill would infringe on the rights of state governments. The Rajya Sabha managed to stay open for business longer than its lower house counterpart, ending the day at 2:50 p.m. Before Parliament began, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had held out hope that key bills could be passed by Feb. 21, when the session ends, although he did anticipate disruptions by opposition lawmakers. “Well, I think these are hiccups,” said Mr. Singh in front of Parliament. “I hope all sections of the House will have the wisdom to set aside these prejudices and create an atmosphere conducive to harmonious working of the House.” According to PRS Legislative Research, an independent agency based in New Delhi that tracks parliamentary proceedings, there are 39 bills pending in this session of Parliament, including six anticorruption measures and the Telangana bill. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president.

Science   The Workout: Training to Bobsled Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Chris Fogt is a U.S. Olympic Team bobsledder. He demonstrates some of the exercises in his workout, which is designed to improve the skills his sport requires. An inside look at fitness routines, by Anahad O’Connor. Being an Olympic bobsledder is a job that requires a precise balance of speed, muscle and weight. The athletes must explode off the starting line while pushing nearly 500 pounds of bobsled at full speed. They need to be strong enough for a powerful launch so the sled will reach speeds exceeding 90 miles an hour. But the athletes also need to be lean in order to lighten the load and wind resistance as they hunker down in the sled. To find out how bobsledders achieve this combination of power and speed, we asked Army Capt. Chris Fogt, a member of the four-man American bobsled team that will compete in Sochi, Russia, to show us the bobsled workout. Captain Fogt, 30, grew up in Georgia and Utah, and is a soldier athlete who served in Iraq and competed in the last Winter Olympics in Vancouver. We caught up with him at the Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, N.Y., to talk about the bobsledder’s training routine, why beach muscles are not a good thing and the highs and sometimes-painful lows of a 90-miles-an-hour sport. Here’s an edited version of our conversation. How did you get into bobsledding? I was running track in college at Utah Valley University back in 2007 when I was recruited for bobsled. There’s not much glamor to it, but I love it because it’s a lot of fun. It’s fast, it’s a little bit dangerous, and we get to travel the world and race with the biggest, fastest athletes on the planet. What are the basics of a bobsledding workout? Bobsledding is a very physical sport. It requires a lot of speed and power. We have track guys that try out and some of them are good, but they’re not quite powerful enough. We have weightlifters come and try out, but they’re not fast enough. That’s because it’s a hybrid of the sports. We lift three to four times a week, we sprint twice a week, and we push the sled out here twice a week. Does bobsledding require some muscles more than others? It’s mostly legwork. So we do a lot of squats, a lot of power cleans, jump squats, box jumps, lunges – everything legs. We also do some upper body stuff but more just for fun and for overall body balance. What is your gym routine like? During the summertime when we’re in the off season and we’re not out in the freezing cold four or five hours a day, we usually lift three to four times a week. While we’re training and sliding at the same time, we usually lift twice a week. On Mondays we do the heavier, slower lifts, like squats, lunges, and bench press. On Wednesdays we do jumps, cleans and the more explosive lifts. And then we race Friday and Saturday. Are there exercises that all bobsledders have to do? Every athlete has their own program, but a few of the constants will be power cleans, squats, jumps, and deadlifts. Those three to four base exercises everyone does, whether you’re on the U.S. team, the British team, German team or Latvian team. Those are the lifts that build the most strength and power. So you focus on weightlifting, but you’re not exactly building beach muscles? No. We don’t do a whole lot of curls, shoulder type work, biceps or chest. When I was back in college, you’d do curls for half an hour a day trying to get large arms. Here, it’s just not functional for us. When you’re in the sled, you’re trying to get as low as you can, and if you have a huge upper body you become a wind sail. If you have huge massive shoulders and a big chest, the wind is hitting you and the sled is slowing down. Whereas if you’re leaner and smaller and flexible, you can get real low and that helps the air flow right over the sled. We want to be strong but lean and mean. Do you follow a special diet? Our diet is basically just to eat everything we want. I try and consume about 5,000 calories a day to maintain weight. So we eat a lot of food. I’m naturally a lot smaller than this. When I first started in the sport, I weighed about 175 pounds. Now I weigh about 215. So I’ve gained about 40 pounds doing the sport. All muscle? Most of it. Is there a specific weight you try to maintain? Most guys in our sport weigh between 215 and 235 pounds. That’s the sweet spot. If you get much larger than that, it’s hard to have the speed to push the bobsled. And if you’re smaller than that, you don’t have the power to push the bobsled. Are there certain foods you like to eat while training? We try to eat a lot of protein and a lot of carbs. To get my hunger and metabolism going, I eat a huge breakfast. And we have a large lunch and large dinner. At breakfast I eat two pancakes, three or four eggs, oatmeal, a glass of orange juice and some yogurt. If I just eat a bowl of cereal for breakfast, I’ll burn it instantly while I’m eating it. What is your role on the team? My job as a four-man brakeman is we get to the starting line and we have to push the sled. The sleds weigh between 400 and 500 pounds. You’re trying to move that sled from zero to as fast as you can very, very quickly. And that’s where the speed and power come into play. So we push for about 50 meters, then all four of us load in very closely together. What happens inside the sled? While we’re in the bobsled we try not to move as much as we can. That’s very hard to do because we hit around 4 to 5 G’s. But you want to be very fluid with the sled, almost like water in a glass. If the sled moves to the right, you slightly lean to the left, and you lean with it as it goes down the track. What would you compare the experience to? It’s kind of like a car wreck. Some trips are better than others. Some trips are very smooth and fast. Some trips you crash. At the last Olympics we were going about 92 miles an hour when we crashed on our heads. So it can be very violent and not very much fun. Is it difficult competing in frigid temperatures? That’s one of the unique things about our sport. During one of our last races, the temperature was minus five degrees, and we’ve had races where it’s been minus 30 before. So right before the race you’re trying to get warm and not pull any muscles. You have to learn how to feel light and fast while you’re freezing. It’s pretty tough but it’s something you learn to cope with. How do you manage being an Olympic athlete in the military? I joined the army in 2005 when I was in school, and I got into bobsledding in 2007. There’s a program called the Army World Class Athlete Program, and it allows me to do both. So after the games in 2010, I went to Iraq for a year with my unit and served out there. When these games are over, I’ll report to Fort Huachuca in Arizona on May 5. I get to wear the flag on both my uniforms, as a soldier and as a U.S. athlete. So it’s a great honor for me. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Sports   What’s Chelsea Missing? A Striker It Let Go. Advertisement Advertisement By ROB HUGHESFEB. 5, 2014 LONDON — For once, José Mourinho let actions speak louder than his words. His Chelsea had dismantled the myth of Manchester City’s impregnability on its own turf. Chelsea ruthlessly found City’s weak spot. Where City had won all 11 of its previous home games this season, it was not even allowed to threaten. Where City had scored in every single home game since November 2010, it was made barren. And though the final score suggested that Chelsea had sneaked in a 1-0 victory, the fact that City’s goal frame rattled three times tells you the real story from Monday night at Etihad Stadium. Mourinho did, of course, have his say. He latched on to a journalist’s remark about the Premier League’s being a three-horse race for City, Chelsea and Arsenal from now until May. “Two horses, and a little horse,” Mourinho responded at Monday’s post-game press conference. “A little horse that still needs milk and to learn how to jump. A horse that next season can race.” The inference is that Mourinho wants people to underestimate Chelsea. He wants them to understand that Arsenal has been evolving under Arsène Wenger for almost two decades, and that Manchester City has so many players that it must still be the favorite. Advertisement And Chelsea? It has been reunited with him for only half a season. It is the “little” horse still feeding on milk. It will be in full stride in another year when, perhaps, he has the money to go out and buy the big beast he needs in attack. Mourinho is, to an extent, not bluffing. Chelsea, like City, has spent a billion dollars of imported money on imported star players over the years. But, unlike City, it has no reliable big-game winner, no striker who can absolutely put the fear of God into opponents. Monday’s winner in Manchester came from an unexpected source. It was a sweet half-volley struck low into the far corner of the net by the left foot of right back Branislav Ivanovic. “A beautiful goal,” conceded City’s coach Manuel Pellegrini ruefully in front of the TV cameras. But then Pellegrini, in his first season in England, spoke about the missing striker Sergio Agüero and the missing midfield power and reliability of Fernandinho. The City coach got to the nub of this defeat. Without Fernandinho at his side, Manchester’s big colossus, Yaya Touré had a fitful, unusually ineffective night in the engine room of the midfield. The stand-in midfielder, Martin Demichelis, was too brittle, too inconsistent on the ball and too easily snuffed out by Chelsea’s powerful athletes, Nemanja Matic and David Luiz. Matic, who has just returned from Benfica to Chelsea, and Luiz, who is a central defender converted to the middle ground, were relentless in their ball-winning. They allowed David Silva, the City creator, nothing. They competed, and won, the battle of force and concentration with Touré. And all around them there were performances of applied energy and sustained application. Gary Cahill, a rare Englishman on this English field, was magnificent in defense. Eden Hazard was the best, and the most industrious, winger on the field. Ramires and Willian, two Brazilians on Chelsea’s squad, were inexhaustible in their appetite for running with the ball. Advertisement All these men obey the basic tenet of Mourinho soccer. They run until tiredness enters their minds, and then they run some more. Forward, and back, forward and back, never shirking the effort that he demands — and it was this lack of energy, this sublimation of art to first be an artisan, that made Mourinho decide Juan Mata could be sold in January to Manchester United. A crowd favorite and Chelsea’s player of the year for two seasons in a row, Mata was allowed to leave for two reasons. One is that even Chelsea must sell players, and not just keep on buying them, because the clock is ticking on UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rule, which is supposed to determine that a club’s spending does not exceed its income. The other, and to Mourinho the omnipotent reason, is that team always comes before the man on his field. Mata is brilliant in creation, but not so much on defense. All the players in Chelsea’s dark blue on Monday were prepared to defend as their first priority, and attack when they could. Mourinho has flirted with rank hypocrisy this week by talking of other teams (meaning City) paying “dodgy” lip service to the UEFA’s financial accounting rule. He spoke patent nonsense because Chelsea and City are both teams owned by billionaires, the one Russian, the second from Abu Dhabi. They hire so many of the world’s talents that just three men among Monday’s 22 starters were English — City goalie Joe Hart and Chelsea central defenders Cahill and John Terry. All the rest, and many of their replacements, come and keep on coming from the global talent pool. And they come for transfer fees and wages that, no matter how the clubs accountants dress it up, exceed all the income they get from gate receipts, TV contracts and commercial deals. Roman Abramovich started this excessive spending at Chelsea a decade ago. The ruling family of Abu Dhabi began buying into Manchester City only in 2008. Advertisement And so City’s spending, not simply on stars but on laying down facilities and building a training academy, currently exceeds Chelsea’s. Measured on the field, City has the talents when all are healthy. Chelsea has the method and will open the vaults next season to buy the one player it lacks. It has no striker like Didier Drogba. The Ivorian, now playing his end game, will be back at Stamford Bridge next month when he turns 36. But after scoring 100 goals in Chelsea blue, he returns in the colors of Galatasaray, the Istanbul team he now plays for. Chelsea must find another Drogba, if any exists, to finish off the chances the Mourinho system works so hard to forge.

Travel   A Weekend in Hungary, Chosen at Random. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER FEB. 5, 2014 Was I ferfi or noi? It was just before dawn on a wintry Saturday, and I had hopped off the Bucharest-to-Budapest overnight train in a place called Mezobereny. The town of almost 11,000 in the eastern Hungarian plains was my destination for the weekend, but I had chosen it quite at random, with a simple goal: to find out what was there. I knew what was not there: any notable tourist attraction, a hotel or restaurant with even a single TripAdvisor review, a concentration of English speakers. But first I had to use the bathroom, and that was presenting a problem, since the stick-figure-free signs read “FERFI WC” and “NOI WC.” I gave a befuddled look to the only other soul in the waiting room, a bundled-up elderly woman. She pointed. Ferfi it was. On my way back to Budapest from more tourist-friendly Transylvania, I had decided to spend my final weekend in a place utterly unknown to me — and, it seemed to any tourists — just to see what would happen. I’d shown up with similar intentions in other places — a weeklong stop in a small town in Mexico, a day in a pistachio-farming village in Turkey, two days in a small Chinese city along the Yangtze. But those were easier missions for various reasons: I speak Spanish, the Turkish are notoriously hospitable to strangers, and in China, well, as the only foreigner in town, lots of people wanted to meet me (or at least trail me at a safe distance). Small-town Hungary seemed a bigger challenge: Hungarians are supposedly reserved and formal; I certainly don’t speak their Finno-Ugric tongue; and my looks don’t attract attention. (As usual, I would not reveal I was a journalist.) Advertisement So the last thing I expected when I stepped out of the station, on the outskirts of town, was a big touristy map of the town, with attractions numbered and indexed. Then again, it was in three languages, none of which I speak: Hungarian, German and oddly enough, a Slavic language I did not recognize. I’d have to get to the bottom of that, but more important right now, I spotted a “szallo,” which I knew meant hotel, in the center of town. Off I trudged, in the predawn half-light, past a Cargill warehouse and a scrap metal heap, through pleasant residential neighborhoods and finally into the center of town. It looked promising. There were a few restaurants, a few stores, an ornate old town hall and, even lovelier, a more subdued neo-Classical building, the Bereny Szallo. I headed through the arched doorway, only to find a hallway without a reception desk. I did, however, find two young men drinking beers, a somewhat notable activity considering it was not yet 7 a.m. They spoke English, and sought out an employee who helped me arrange a room; the cost per night was 3,500 forints, an absurdly low $14.75 at 236 forints to the dollar. To my surprise, the men were visitors like me. “We’re from Budapest,” one said. “We’re here to go to a pig killing.” I had been in town a half-hour, and already I was invited to a pig killing? I couldn’t believe my luck, and of course, I asked if I might tag along. “The pig’s already dead,” one said, and I felt as if I was getting the brushoff. Sure enough, when I wheeled my luggage around the corner for the staff to store, they took off. A bit depressed at the missed opportunity, I headed across the street to a small bakery, where I drowned my sorrows with a coffee and a kakaos csiga, a snail-shaped chocolate pastry that cost 140 forints. I then set off to wander. (And if I happened to run across a certain pig-killing, all the better.) The town turned out to be a subtle charmer. Tidy houses — some looking a century old or more — lined streets that were quiet but for the occasional fenced-in dog. A notable number of gray-haired locals were out on bicycles, which, even on a drizzly day, were more common than cars. FOR SOME REASON, I felt euphoric. Perhaps it the utter randomness of where I was, or perhaps it was because I had literally no idea what I would find on the next block. The smallest discoveries in an unknown place can match the thrill of visiting well-known attractions — Versailles, the Grand Canyon — that you knew were coming and you’d read all about. Advertisement My first find was a small industrial building on an otherwise residential block, metal barrels lined up in front. I noted a word stenciled on a concrete wall outside: SZESZFOZDE. Tapping it into Google Translate, I got just about the best result I could imagine: Distillery. I had the phone pronounce it for me; the result was something like SUHSS-feuz-duh. Good enough. “Szeszfozde?” I said to two men standing outside the building. They nodded. They did not speak English. I pointed to my camera, I pointed inside, they waved me in. The barrels were full of fermenting grape juice; they were producing the Hungarian fruit brandy known as palinka. The older man showed me the tangle of pipes and copper stills and other contraptions. Using my phone to translate, I asked a few questions. How much did they produce? (Three hundred liters a day.) Why were they working Saturday? (Shrugs.) Could I buy some? (No.) “They must either sell it wholesale, or customers have to bring empty bottles,” I wrote in my notebook. I would turn out to be wrong. After taking shelter from the rain at a 24-hour fast-food stand, where I ate a burger with a guy named Gabor who had worked as a housekeeper for a year or so in Richmond, Va., I looped back downtown. That’s where I found the Orlai Petrics Soma Kulturalis Kozpont Muzealis Gyujtemenye, a local museum housed in an expansive old home near the town hall. I headed in, startling a young, wispy-bearded man named Zsolt, who was not expecting any visitors. (I was the first in three weeks, he said, and possibly the first foreigner ever.) Waiving the entrance fee, he took me on a tour, past the embroidery work of the town’s own Kiszely Janosne and a crazy old contraption of gears and chains and pedals to carbonate water. Advertisement More interesting were rooms full of colorful traditional furniture and household goods. It was traditional Slovak design, he said. Slovak? He then revealed the mystery of the trilingual sign: Mezobereny had been destroyed several times over the years; during its most recent rebirth, in the 18th and 19th centuries, a mix of Hungarians, Germans and Slovaks were brought in to repopulate it. Also in the museum was a memorial to the Jews of Mezobereny who had been taken away (and presumably killed) during World War II. Zsolt told me he didn’t know of any Jews living in town these days. It was a reminder that even small towns off the tourist radar can have fascinating, and sometimes difficult histories. MY HOTEL ROOM would be ready by now, and after settling in with a quick nap, I headed for what I figured would be an easy way to meet people: Roman Catholic Mass. Advertisement In the entryway to the church, I joined a small group that had congregated to chat: two older women, the priest and a young blond woman named Eszter, who briefly helped translate and then disappeared upstairs. Turned out she was the organist. Attendance was sparse, and mostly in the non-English-speaking, elderly woman demographic. But one family group stood out: a middle-aged couple and three young adults. “We heard about you!” the father told me. “You’re looking for accommodations!” That was the misinterpretation of the pre-Mass chat circle, but they quickly grasped what I was doing in town. When I told them about my experience in the szeszfozde, the son, Balazs Doczy (who attends an English-language university in Budapest) said his godfather, Istvan Csavas, made the best palinka in town. “I’m thinking we should go knock on his door and see if he has some for you to try,” he said. Funny, I was thinking that too. We walked a couple of blocks to his house, and his wife, Zsuzsi, answered, looking a bit tired. There was a flurry of conversation in Hungarian, and Balazs translated for her: “She says to pardon her appearance. She was at a pig-killing today.” Could there have been two pig-killings the same day? Possibly, but not this time: I learned that the young, beer-swilling men from Budapest were part of a group of doctors who had been invited out for the event. Istvan was not there, but we were able to sample his palinka, in elegant shot glasses with teacup-style handles. The pear variety was my favorite, smooth and rich and redolent of fruit; it knocked the socks off some commercial palinka I had tried the week before in Budapest. And I was welcome back the next day to buy some. After downing the palinka, I needed some food in my stomach. Everyone I had met had recommended the same restaurant, Topart Vendeglo. Though it was a pleasant place — more banquet hall than restaurant in appearance — I had a rather unmemorable dinner of pork croquettes (a house specialty) and vegetable soup with noodles that looked like maggots (but tasted fine). It turned out that the restaurant was also a guesthouse with three upstairs rooms, each with a themed décor: German, Hungarian and Slovak. Dinner was 3,100 forints, bringing my total for the day (including lodging) to about $32. Small towns were not only fascinating, they were cheap. Balazs and family had suggested that I take the bus the next day to Gyula, a town 20 miles away, to try out its relatively famous bathhouse; I did, and it was fine, but I was eager to get back and buy my palinka. When I showed up, Istvan was expecting me; both he and Zsuzsi were very affable despite the language gap. Soon, their English-speaking son, also named Istvan, arrived with his wife and young daughter, and things picked up, with his translations and freely poured palinka as conversational lubricants. I answered Zsuzsi’s questions about American education (she was a retired schoolteacher) and offered my own about how they got outside news before the fall of Communism. (The Voice of America, among other sources.) They also resolved one final mystery for me. Istvan didn’t distill the palinka himself; he brought the fermented fruit juice to the very szeszfozde I had visited for distillation (explaining why I had come away empty-handed). Advertisement Two hours later, I had new friends, two bottles of palinka to go (2,500 forints each), and a rapidly encroaching headache. Before I left, they invited me to ... a Monday morning pig killing. I was due on the 5:30 a.m. to Budapest and had a flight to catch. Perhaps the next time I was in Mezobereny. An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of an organist at a Roman Catholic church in Mezobereny. She is Eszter, not Ester. It also misspelled the given name of a retired schoolteacher who hosted the author at her home. She is Zsuzsi, not Szussi. Follow Seth on his frugal adventures via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Business   The Olympics: A Costly Feel-Good Moment. Advertisement Advertisement By DAVID GILLEN and CHANNON HODGEFEB. 6, 2014 The 2014 Olympics in Sochi are estimated to be the most expensive yet. While host cities hope the games will bring in a profit, they have more often than not created long-term economic burdens. Even before the Olympic torch reached Sochi on Wednesday — after a 39,000-mile journey, the longest in the history of the Games — another Olympic record had already been shattered: the cost of the Games. The 2014 Winter Games, which open in the Russian city on Friday, will be the most expensive Olympics of all time. The estimated price tag is more than $50 billion, or approximately $510 million for each event. Hosting the Games is never cheap, but the bill keeps climbing as cities try to outbid one another for a chance to throw an Olympic-size party. To put Sochi in context, consider that in 1984, the Summer Games in Los Angeles cost about $546 million, or $1.2 billion in today’s dollars. The Games are often billed as a boon for the host, a two-week bonanza of tourism and valuable television time. But do host countries really benefit economically? Advertisement It depends — but don’t count on it. Only a handful of Games (for instance, Los Angeles, in 1984; Barcelona, in 1992; and Atlanta, in 1996) have ended up in the black. And if you count all of the costs related to the Games, it is doubtful the Olympics ever turn out to be a major economic success, said Victor Matheson, who has studied the economics of big events like the Olympics and the World Cup. While tourism during the Olympics may help offset the expense for some cities, a spike in arrivals is not guaranteed. Beijing actually saw a drop in hotel bookings during its Summer Games in 2008. In pure economic terms, the best hope for Russia is that Sochi’s new sports venues, roads and hotels will turn the city into a tourist destination. “One of the things you’re always hoping is that you’ll have some long-term impact,” said Mr. Matheson, a professor of economics at the College of the Holy Cross. “And there had better be some sort of legacy, because if you’re going to spend $50 billion on the Olympics, like Russia, there’s no way you can possibly get that back in the two weeks that they are going on.” So why host? The simplest answer may be this: It makes people feel good. “The Olympics may not make us rich,” Mr. Matheson said, “but they make us happy.” Go to Home Page »
Energy   Seeking Balance Between Environment and Economy. Advertisement Advertisement Green Column By STANLEY REED FEB. 5, 2014 LONDON — Can the European Union’s environmental aspirations coexist with industrialists like Lakshmi Mittal, the steel mogul? That question is very much influencing the debate about how Europe should go about combating climate change in the future. In January, the European Commission, the executive body of the 28-nation Union, published new proposals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through 2030. The major elements of these proposals — a new target to reduce greenhouse gases by 40 percent from 1990 levels, as well as Europe-wide goals for renewable energy and measures to bolster flagging prices on Europe’s carbon-trading market — are not as ambitious as some environmentalists would have liked. But they are still likely to increase energy costs and, thus, competitive pressures on heavy industry. One reason that the commission did not push for higher goals is that companies like ArcelorMittal, the Luxembourg-based steel giant that Mr. Mittal heads, had already started to warn that Europe’s energy and environmental policies were threatening jobs and investment. ArcelorMittal employs about 100,000 people in Europe, many of them in sprawling mills that produce substantial amounts of pollution. At this point, the targets are just proposals. They may not survive in their present form, and it will probably be many months before they become binding. Advertisement What is sure is that the stage is now set for an intense lobbying tug of war between those who say that Europe must continue to lead the world on climate change and others who say that Europe needs to rethink its priorities. Much will be on the line, including Europe’s credibility on climate change and the thorny question of whether there is still a role in Europe for energy-intensive businesses like ArcelorMittal. The International Energy Agency forecasts that energy-intensive exporters on the Continent will lose about a third their global market share over the next couple of decades. Energy costs are a big issue for European industrialists. The rule of thumb is that natural gas, a major industrial fuel, is now twice as expensive in Europe as in the United States, contributing to higher electric power costs. In an interview, Robrecht Himpe, a top executive in ArcelorMittal’s European steel business, said the company would save $1 billion annually if its European mills could somehow be powered by American energy. Mr. Himpe estimated that the European proposals, if implemented, would eventually add about 25 percent to the energy costs of producing steel, which he said were now about 126 euros, or about $170, per metric ton for steel that sells for about ¤440 per ton. Mr. Himpe also said after substantial investments by Arcelor to reduce its emissions, there was little more it could do. Under the recommendations, the price of pumping out one metric ton of carbon in Europe would rise from ¤6 a ton currently to about ¤70 a ton by 2030, according to a study by ThomsonReuters Point Carbon, a research firm based in Oslo. Mr. Himpe said that if the European Commission did not buffer these increases on steel and other big energy users, it would “risk damaging these industries, which are a motor for the European Union’s economic recovery.” He also said that unless Europe adopted more industry-friendly policies, it would be difficult for companies like ArcelorMittal to make the long-term investments that they need to keep their plants going. Advertisement Does it matter if heavy industry gradually fades away in Europe? Georg Zachmann, an analyst focused on energy and climate issues at Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization, does not think so. “If you have high electricity prices, you lose energy-intensive industries, but at the same time the economy rebalances by increasing competitiveness in other products,” he said. Disagreement about energy policies extends to the top levels of the European Commission. A few days after the Commission published its proposals, Europe’s top energy official, Günther Oettinger, who helped draft the proposals, suggested that Europe needed to think differently about itself. The European Union now accounts for about 11 percent of global carbon emissions, and that percentage will drop by more than half by 2030, Mr. Oettinger told a business group. “To think that with 4.5 percent of global emissions you can save the world is not realistic; it is arrogant or is stupid,” he said. But European politicians have an easier time setting environmental targets than nurturing economic growth. In the mid-2000s, the European Union adopted binding targets for emissions reductions and for the use renewable energy sources that made the Continent the darling of the environmental movement. The problem is that much of the rest of the world did not follow. Europe will very likely succeed in meeting or surpassing its original goal of a 20 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, but these policies may have encouraged investment and employment to shift elsewhere. Recent European Commission studies have shown that Europe’s share of global foreign direct investment fell to 16.8 percent in 2012 from 30 percent in 2008. In roughly the same period, Europe lost 3.5 million manufacturing jobs. With the new proposals, Europe may be setting emission reduction targets without a full assessment of what sort of economy it wants to have and how it will get there. “This is another set of environmental targets that is not being reconciled with broader energy issues in Europe,” said Fabien Roques, an analyst in Paris with the consulting firm Compass Lexecon. “How does this square with other objectives like competitiveness, keeping the lights on and power market design?” The key is for Europe to persuade countries like the United States and China to adopt similar policies. There may be more hope of that happening: Many businesses, including some oil companies, are preparing for a global policy shift that would be more in line with what Europe is pursuing. But until that change happens, companies like ArcelorMittal may be endangered species in Europe. An earlier version of this article misstated a target in new European Commission proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposals aim to reduce greenhouse gases by 40 percent from 1990 levels — not from 2020 levels — through 2030. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   In Our Pages: February 7. Advertisement   LONDON — A ban on ‘‘Love,’’ an American parlor game similar to monopoly and parchesi, in which the Archbishop of Canterbury personifies an obstacle and cards marked ‘‘Wallis and Edward’’ give their holders immediate victory, was asked, in the House Of Commons. Harry Day, Labor M.P. of Southwark, questioned Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare whether his attention had been drawn to the game which ‘‘ridicules prominent English personages, including incidents relating to the British Crown, and asked whether he would prohibit circulation of the game in England. 1964: Cuba Cuts Water to U.S. Base WASHINGTON — The Cuban government today [Feb. 6] told the United States that it has cut off water to the Guantanamo Bay Naval base in retaliation for the arrest of 36 Cuban fishermen last Sunday. A note delivered to the State Department through the Swiss Embassy said: ‘‘water service to Guantanamo Bay has been suspended and the suspension will continue until the Cuban fishermen are released. The Cuban government has no obligation to supply water to the naval base under any international treaty, and has been doing so only for the sake of not increasing tension between the two countries,’’ the note said.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Home   A Place to Park Himself. Advertisement Advertisement On Location By NICK AMIES FEB. 5, 2014 James van der Velden wanted something out of the ordinary in a home. But not in the conventional sense. He wasn’t interested, for example, in any of the beautiful 17th-century townhouses this city is known for. “I had been looking for an extraordinary property for quite some time,” said Mr. Van der Velden, 29, “when I came across this garage.” An abandoned commercial building from the 1950s, it wasn’t what most people would consider special, or even particularly interesting. And it needed a lot of work. But Mr. Van der Velden is an architect and interior designer, so that was fine with him. “The moment I walked into the garage for the first time, I had an idea of what I wanted to do,” he said. “So the design process went quite quickly.” After buying the building in late 2012 for a little over $600,000, he set about turning the 1,450-square-foot space into his idea of a home. And nearly a year later, with the $200,000 renovation complete, he moved in. It still looks more or less the same from the outside. But behind the roll-down garage door, and past a small parking space, there is now a floor-to-ceiling wall of glass and steel. Step through the double doors and you’ll find a modern, black-and-white kitchen. A rustic wood table that Mr. Van der Velden designed runs along the center of the room, with two huge industrial lights suspended over it — a homage, he said, to the history of the space. The living area beyond is double-height, with a glass atrium that brings light into the space. More glass-and-steel walls surround a central courtyard open to the elements, where there is a garden with potted plants. (When it rains, water flows to a central drainage system.) “The garage was one big, open space, so we had to make all the walls to create the rooms,” Mr. Van der Velden said. Even so, he added: “The biggest job was taking a part out of the roof to create the inside garden. But this was a very important feature for me: to have this open interior space.” Advertisement On the other side of the garden are two bedrooms: a guest room with a small bathroom and the master bedroom suite, which is dominated by a motorcycle perched on top of the shelves opposite the bed. The motorcycle, like many of the furnishings here, is vintage. “Nearly everything in my home is bought at Parisian flea markets or through online auctions,” he said. “I wanted a place where I could showcase my collections. Like a museum, but where people aren’t afraid to touch things.” Unlike a museum, however, the space that Mr. Van der Velden calls his “little oasis” doesn’t advertise its presence from the street. And visitors, he said, are often visibly taken aback. “I never get bored by the look of surprise I see on the faces of guests when I open the garage door.” A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2014, on page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: A Place to Park Himself.

Science   Living With Cancer: An Artist’s View Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement  Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.  Every time I sign a consent form, I wonder how informed I really am. Do physicians — can physicians— convey the consequences of their treatments to cancer patients? Or is this where artists step in? A few years before the Canadian painter Robert Pope died in 1992, he dealt with an aggressive form of Hodgkin’s disease by undergoing a succession of standard treatments and by creating evocative canvases about the fraught experiences of cancer patients. Social realism meets surrealism in large paintings that portray the loneliness of sick men and women within the sterility of contemporary hospitals. Pope’s works —reproduced in the book “Illness & Healing” — ask us to think about blood sacrifice: about patients as well as caretakers reenacting archaic, fearful rituals in technologically advanced settings. Take, for example, his painting “Radiation,” in which a man lies alone on a narrow plank beneath a huge machine directing rays at his abdomen. The artist explains that “the red lasers which are used for positioning suggest a Christian cross, the table the man lies on is like an altar, he is covered with a white shroud, the machine hovers above him like an idol or faceless god that must be propitiated with bodily sacrifices.” Holding still in a black void, the marked man is caught in the beamed cross-hairs. He has to expose himself to a dreaded otherness that he cannot possibly understand and that all others flee. Will its invisible powers heal or harm him? In another painting, “Chemotherapy,” a turbaned woman lying on her side pulls up a sheet to cover herself. Beneath her, in the foreground, a disproportionately large syringe of Adriamycin looms. The chemical is red, like life-giving blood and the Red Cross, but also like an alarming stop sign or the inferno of its “red devil” nickname. The knot on her turban parallels the knot of her clenched knuckles, all imbued with the purple pigment called “caput mortuum” (which looks like dried blood and means “dead head”). Does the patient shrink from a drug that will debilitate her or accept its curative capacities? Such ambiguous images address the isolation of treatment. In paintings that include other figures, the perspective generally remains that of the patient in the hospital bed — again prone, but sometimes without a head. For we view the scene from the patient’s perspective, as if we were he. From his vantage, white-coated physicians tower over him, as do most visitors. In a self-portrait with Robert Pope’s doctor, the physical intimacy of the standing physician with the seated patient is meant to convey the relationship between “priest and layperson.” Next to a bedside picture of Jesus in another work, Mr. Pope draws a tray of syringes to suggest that “faith in science has replaced faith in religion.” Even when the artist’s figures are upright and vertical and entwined, they are riven on the stake. In the six-foot high “Hug,” the clasping patient and caregiver are divided — here by the IV rod that sunders the couple “like a dagger,” in the artist’s words. Although the man and woman encircle each other in their embrace, they are cleaved by the cross of the IV pole, holding high its bag of solutions. The intravenous tubes undulating around the pole form the spiral figure of infinity, although in some drafts the tubes look serpentine. Will the loving couple be destroyed by venomous toxins or sustained in the continuum of life and death? In the cancer dance, patient and caregiver remain indistinguishable since both are entangled in the paraphernalia of treatment. Though we accept ambiguity in art, it is harder to accept in science, harder still in medicine. Robert Pope’s work reminds us that often patients and caregivers cannot fathom what we sign up for. Even when physicians try to communicate the consequences of their prescriptions, patients need to make a leap of faith. Mr. Pope’s paintings make me wonder: Is cancer treatment a form of religion, a means of transformation that involves its own rituals, trials, high priests, sacraments, vestments and bodily signs for people in need of a miracle and convinced that we have to be stripped of everything before we can be reborn? In “Stations of the Heart,” a memoir about his son’s death from metastatic melanoma, the theologian Richard Lischer writes, “The religion of cancer treatment holds out the carrot of survival. It confuses the prolongation of life with salvation.” Do chemotherapy and radiation endanger more precious forms of redemption: the wholeness of the human spirit, connectedness, and compassion? Susan Gubar is a distinguished emerita professor of English at Indiana University and the author of “Memoir of a Debulked Woman,” which explores her experience with ovarian cancer.

Business   Entering the Era of Private and Semi-Anonymous Apps. Advertisement Today’s Web-enabled gadgets should come with a digital Miranda warning. “Anything you say or do online, from a status update to a selfie, can and will be used as evidence against you on the Internet.” Over the past couple of years, it has become clear that everything we do online is somehow being tracked and tied back to our offline identity. Each update, Fav, Like or comment we make lives on in perpetuity. It’s pretty hard to avoid this  — just ask Anthony Weiner. But a slew of new apps — including Wut, Secret, Confide, Popcorn and Telegram — that have come out in recent months are offering hope to the Anthony Weiners of the world, and to the rest of us, too. They are intended to let users either talk secretly with people they know, or blurt out random comments to total strangers. For example, Confide and Telegram allow you to send messages to people that “self-destruct” after they have been viewed. With Confide, text is blocked out and can be seen only when you slide your finger over the screen. Receiving messages makes you feel like some sort of James Bond character. Telegram offers private chatrooms where you can set a “timer” and all the text vanishes after a set period of time — usually one to five minutes. Many of these messaging start-ups are clearly variations on SnapChat, an app that allows you to take and send a vanishing picture. It exploded in popularity last year. But there are some that go beyond just messaging and are created to be social. The idea of an “anonymous social network” might sound as ridiculous as a puppy that doesn’t like going outside for walks. Yet that’s how this new crop of social apps work. Secret, which seems to be relishing its 15 minutes of fame, allows you to gossip anonymously about whatever you want. It’s unclear if the “secrets” being shared are fact or fiction or from whom they came. But beware, open this app and you’ll find yourself in a sea of negativity, with apparent Silicon Valley citizens complaining about venture capitalists, founders of companies and their “friends.” On Secret, the negative seems to be predominant at least partially because there are no consequences to what you say. In an email message, David Byttow and Chrys Bader, co-founders of Secret, said the app was not intended to be full of spite, but rather to increase authenticity and empathy between people online. “We’ve seen so many examples of amazing support both in our friend circle and shared by others,” the two said in the message. “Though, given the nature of the product, each user has their own, unique vantage point. And some of those vantage points will not publicly highlight the most positive aspects of Secret.” They added: “We’ll continue to encourage positivity on Secret through our product and policy decisions every step of the way. ” The new social app called Wut is a bit like Facebook with only your friends’ status updates and nothing more. It’s dead simple. When you send a message, only your friends will see it, yet they will have no idea the note came from you unless you say. While it may sound totally bizarre, it’s also incredibly fun, and because you know it’s just your friends on the network, it’s surprisingly personal. Wut feels intended to make people feel good, not bad. Paul McKellar, chief executive officer of Wut, said the app started as an experiment that he built in an hour for his friends, and it soon became apparent that it was highly addictive. He teamed up with Beamer Wilkins, a designer and app maker, and the two released the current incarnation of Wut last month. Mr. McKellar said Wut is intended to be “a very lightweight and very casual social network.” He said there was “no doubt or fear with what you’re posting; there’s no anxiety.” “I can post things on Wut that I don’t want to last forever,” he said. “And that message is unattributed and casually anonymous.” While the messages do live on the network for a short time, Mr. McKellar said they were deleted as soon as possible from the servers. Additionally, Wut’s alerts are silent, so your phone doesn’t vibrate or ding loudly when someone sends a message on the network. Then there is Popcorn Messaging, which allows you to privately chat with anyone in a one-mile radius of your smartphone. The app hopes to enable people to anonymously talk with other people at local events, including sports games, or to just find people to banter in the area. All of these vanishing social apps could vanish themselves at some point —  viral sensations that go the way of Chatroulette. Or we could be reaching a point where people want online places to be able to share privately and semi-anonymously, and one of these apps will rise to the top. It’s accurate to say that in some instances these apps are going to be used for things that may cross a moral line — like cheating on a significant other or organizing secret, nefarious meetings — but they also hold the promise of being used by people who want to have a little fun online, and don’t want the status update they share to be used as evidence against them later on the Internet.

Foreign   Ban on Liquids for Carry-Ons on Direct U.S.-Russia Flights. Advertisement Advertisement By ASHLEY SOUTHALLFEB. 7, 2014 Passengers on nonstop flights between the United States and Russia have been prohibited from packing liquids, gels, aerosols or powders in their carry-on bags during the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi under a new directive issued by the United States Transportation Security Administration. The ban, which Delta Air Lines announced on its website on Thursday, was imposed amid concerns that terrorists might try to assemble explosives in the air or at the Games from materials smuggled onto planes. The Department of Homeland Security warned airlines about that possibility on Wednesday, although the agency added that it was not aware of a specific threat. “Our security posture, which at all times includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, will continue to respond and appropriately adapt to protect the American people from an ever-evolving threat picture,” a department official said. “These measures include intelligence gathering and analysis, deployment of cutting-edge technology, random canine team searches at airports, federal air marshals, federal flight deck officers, temporarily restricting certain items and more security measures both visible and invisible to the public.” The temporary restrictions exclude prescription medications and do not apply to checked bags. Delta Air Lines, the only American carrier with regularly scheduled direct flights to Russia, said passengers traveling to Russia must check in with an airline representative, instead of online or at electronic kiosks. United Airlines, the official carrier of the American Olympic team, does not have direct flights to Russia but operates charter flights to Sochi. The Olympics in Sochi are opening on Friday and are scheduled to run through Feb. 23. Michael D. Shear contributed reporting from Washington. Go to Home Page »

Politics   In PracticeTracking the Affordable Care Act. View All Posts » BOSTON – Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has appointed an insurance executive to oversee repairs to the state’s bungled effort to bring its health exchange in line with the requirements of President Obama’s health care law. Mr. Patrick also announced the state will pay a technology firm, Optum, nearly $10 million to help fix the exchange. “The point is to catch up on the backlog and deliver a system that will give our residents convenience and confidence,” said Mr. Patrick at a news conference in Boston on Thursday. The announcements came the same day as the release of a report that was critical of the state and its principal systems integration contractor, CGI, for the bumpy rollout last fall of an updated version of the state’s health care exchange, an online marketplace for health insurance. Problems with the exchange meant that many applications had to be processed by hand. Tens of thousands of applicants were either given temporary insurance coverage by the state or had their existing state coverage extended, rather than being enrolled in private plans under the new health care law, the Affordable Care Act. Some users have complained that they are unsure of their coverage status because they were not immediately informed about it. At the end of last year, according to a New York Times analysis, the state was last in the nation in meeting enrollment goals, signing up only 5,428 applicants in private plans. By Thursday night, 8,444 people were enrolled in private plans under the exchange. 111,000 applicants had their previous state coverage extended, while 30,000 were given temporary state coverage. The failure of the website here has been deeply embarrassing both to state officials and proponents of Mr. Obama’s law, which in many ways was modeled on Massachusetts’ own health care overhaul enacted in 2006. Before the Affordable Care Act took effect, Massachusetts had its own online marketplace, which was running smoothly. But that system had to be updated to comply with the new federal system. A report commissioned by the state and conducted by an outside technology company, MITRE, identified “significant problems” with CGI’s work, saying the IT contractor did not have the expertise to build the site, had lost data, failed to adequately test functions and poorly managed the project. CGI was also a major contractor on the problem-plagued federal health care exchange. In a statement, CGI’S vice president of global communications, Linda Ororsio, said the company “looks forward to continuing our work with Optum to accelerate improvement of the Massachusetts Health Connector. We remain determined to help Massachusetts residents get insured by enrolling in health plans via the Connector, and we fully intend to meet our contractual obligations.” But the report said it was not clear which of the state organizations that worked on the project – the Massachusetts Health Connector, MassHealth (the state’s Medicaid program) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School – was in charge. “There does not appear to be a consistent, unified vision for the system nor clear lines of accountability for implementing the vision,” the report said. Mr. Patrick said that his appointment of Sarah Iselin, a Blue Cross Blue Shield executive who worked to implement the 2006 health law here, would improve the state’s monitoring of CGI by using a single executive instead of a committee. “This vendor required and will require a much shorter leash,” Mr. Patrick said. A team of 300 people from Optum, the technology firm that has helped improve the functionality of the federal health exchange, will work with Ms. Iselin and CGI to fix the state’s website. They will be paid up to $9.8 million over the next month, and the contract may be extended. “The technology is fixable,” said Andy Slavitt, a group executive vice president at Optum. “There’s a lot to do and there are more resources needed, but the right activities are underway under Sarah’s leadership.” Mr. Patrick said the state would continue working with CGI for now, although they have only paid the company about $15 million of its $68 million contract. “We are only going to pay them if we get a workable system,” said Mr. Patrick. He said that the thought of dismissing CGI had crossed his mind, but the project, with issues of code ownership, was too complex for a clean break with the company. “We still need CGI for the time being,” the governor said.
Science   A Catalog of Cancer Genes That’s Done, or Just a Start. Advertisement Advertisement Carl Zimmer MATTER FEB. 6, 2014 Cancer is a disease of genes gone wrong. When certain genes mutate, they make cells behave in odd ways. The cells divide swiftly, they hide from the immune system that could kill them and they gain the nourishment they need to develop into tumors. Scientists started identifying these cancer genes in the 1970s and their list slowly grew over the years. By studying them, scientists came to understand how different types of cancer develop and in some cases they were even able to develop gene-targeting drugs. Last May, for example, the Food and Drug Administration approved a drug known as Tarceva as a first-line treatment for lung cancer in which a gene called EGFR has mutated. The National Institutes of Health, hoping to speed up the identification of cancer genes, started an ambitious project in 2005 called the Cancer Genome Atlas. They analyzed 500 samples from each of over 20 types of cancer and found a wealth of new genes. The data have helped scientists discover more of the tricks cancer cells use to thrive at our expense. “The Cancer Genome Atlas has been a spectacular success, there’s no doubt about that,” said Bruce Stillman, the president of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. But now, as the Atlas project is coming to an end, researchers at the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard have published a study in the journal Nature that has scientists debating where cancer research should go next. They estimated that scientists would need to examine about 100,000 cancer samples —10 times as many as the $375 million Cancer Genome Atlas has gathered — to find most of the genes involved in 50 cancer types. Advertisement “We now know what it would take to get a complete catalog,” said Eric S. Lander, the founding director of the Broad Institute and a co-author of the new study. “And we now know we’re not close to done. We have a lot left to learn.” Traditionally, scientists have identified cancer genes by comparing healthy cells with cancerous ones. If they find a statistically unusually high number of cells with mutations in a particular gene, they can then examine it to see if it really does help drive cancer — or if it is just carrying a harmless mutation. Dr. Lander and his colleagues suspected this method could miss some genes. While some cancer genes affect most cells of a given type of cancer, other genes are only involved in a fraction of them. (EGFR, the gene treated with Tarceva, is mutated in only about 10 percent of cases of nonsmall cell lung cancer.) Small samples of cancer cells might not contain the less common mutations. The Broad researchers suspected that they could catch some of these missing genes by looking at several cancer types at once, because some genes are not limited to a single type of cancer. For their new study, the scientists examined cancer samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as cancer samples from the Broad’s own collection. All told, they analyzed 4,742 samples from 21 types of cancer. The new study detected many of the genes that other scientists have previously linked to those 21 types of cancer. But they also found new genes that had been overlooked before. All told, they identified 33 genes that they consider strong candidates for playing a role in cancer — a potential increase of the catalog of cancer genes of 25 percent. “This was eye-opening to me,” said Dr. Lander. Dr. Lander and his colleagues began to wonder how many genes could be found if scientists looked at more cancer samples. Was the cancer catalog almost finished, or only just begun? “We were able to ask for the first time, ‘Are we there yet?'” said Dr. Lander. They extrapolated from their own results to gauge how many more samples scientists would need to look at to find most cancer genes involved in at least 2 percent of cancers of a given type. Advertisement To find most cancer genes involved in the 50 most common types of cancer, the researchers estimated that they would have to analyze 100,000 samples. In other words, the atlas has gotten us a tenth of the way to the finish line. Dr. Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, said the study has raised valuable questions. “The paper provides some models about what we might think about doing next,” he said. He said the agency is now considering testing Dr. Lander’s hypothesis on a few types of cancer by gathering more samples. Dr. Lander and his colleagues argue for finishing off the cancer gene catalog. “Completing the genomic analysis of this disease should be a biomedical imperative,” they wrote in their new paper. In an interview, Dr. Lander said knowing most genes involved in cancer would be a powerful weapon against the disease. “How could we think of beating cancer in the long term without having the whole catalog?” he said. “It would be crazy not to have the information.” But Dr. Stillman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said completing the atlas has to be weighed against other needs. “Whether we need to know every cancer gene, I’d like to see an argument for how that’s going to help the advancement of new therapy,” he said. For many researchers, the question comes down to whether extending the atlas project would be the best use of existing research funds. “There’s no question that it would be valuable. The question is whether it’s worth it,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Johns Hopkins University. Some scientists say it might make more sense to study common cancer genes that have already been identified, instead of searching for relatively rare genes that might not turn out to be helpful in fighting cancer. Also in question is who would pay for advancing the cancer catalog project. “We still don’t know how much money we’re going to have this year,” said Dr. Varmus of the National Cancer Institute’s budget. “We’re not going to set off tomorrow and do 100,000 complete genomes.” Dr. Lander argued that the project could be done for a reasonable cost, and might also be supported by philanthropic organizations or international partners. In any case, he said, he welcomed a debate about when science will finish the cancer gene catalog. Advertisement “If people say, ‘I would rather not know that for five years, or 10 years,’ that’s a reasonable argument,” said Dr. Lander. “But I would rather know that sooner.” Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated a finding of the new study.  The researchers estimated that scientists would need to examine about 100,000 cancer samples — not genes — to find most of the genes involved in 50 cancer types.

Sports   England Picks Harmony Over Headache. Advertisement Advertisement By HUW RICHARDSFEB. 6, 2014 Kevin Pietersen may not be wanted by England anymore, but that does not mean he won’t be a hot commodity elsewhere. On Tuesday, England told Pietersen, its star batsman and its highest run-scorer across all formats of the international game, that he was no longer part of the team’s plans and was being dropped. He was the second major casualty from England’s Ashes debacle, following the resignation of Coach Andy Flower after the 5-0 loss in Australia. Pietersen’s next step will most likely be to join the players who make a lucrative living competing in Twenty20 tournaments. Now that he is available for the whole season in the Indian Premier League, he will probably be a hot property during its auction next week. England’s decision to jettison Pietersen ended one of the most contentious careers in international cricket over the past few decades. Nobody polarized opinions more than Pietersen did in his nine years as an England player. For every admirer of his artistry with the bat, there was a critic of his egotism or how he ended up leaving his native South Africa to play for England. Pietersen, 33, vowed Tuesday that he would not quit the sport. “I believe I still have a great deal to give as a cricketer,” he said in an official statement issued by the England and Wales Cricket Board. “I will continue to play, but sadly it will not be for England.” Advertisement While his desire to play as much I.P.L cricket as possible was a consistent source of tension with England’s management, his sorrow about the end of his international career appears genuine. No longer will he be playing the prestigious five-day test matches and battling the very best in the most demanding form of the game. His numbers — 13,797 runs in all formats, including 8,181 runs and 23 scores of more than 100 or more in his 104 five-day test matches — place him among England’s best-ever batsmen. Jonathan Agnew, the BBC’s cricket correspondent and a former England player, called Pietersen “possibly the most entertaining, brilliant and unorthodox batsman I have ever seen.” Those gifts were clear in remarkable innings like the 149 he struck against South Africa in 2012 as he toyed with the Proteas’ fearsome pacemen, and in his strokes, like his audacious reverse sweep for six runs in 2006 off the lethal Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan. “England are certainly not a better team without him,” the former England captain Nasser Hussain told Sky Sports News. Shane Warne, the former Australia spin bowler, said on Twitter that “To me it’s a disgrace and a joke.” But Pietersen’s undoubted brilliance often came at a cost, as he often proved a disruptive force, upsetting team chemistry. While praising him, Agnew backed the decision to drop him. “Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England,” said Paul Downton, managing director of England cricket. “The time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team, but also team ethics and philosophy.” Exactly what provoked the decision to drop Pietersen has not been specified. But he has a long record of alienating former allies and of falling out with his teams and officials. Major figures in the meeting that resulted in his departure were England’s captain, Alastair Cook, who last year went out of his way to reintegrate Pietersen into the team after an earlier dispute, and its one-day coach Ashley Giles, who not long ago called Pietersen a “million-pound talent.” Advertisement In the 2009 Ashes series, Michael Clarke of Australia flagellated himself for letting his team down by playing a poor shot. Pietersen, similarly guilty, explained that “that’s the way I play.” A brilliant but disruptive 25-year-old may have a decade of productivity in front of him, along with the hope that the maturity will follow, so he would most likely be given more latitude. But at 33, there is much less productivity to come, and little hope of reform. “You can be an individual within the team but you cannot just be an individual. He has said ‘This is how I play, take it or leave it,”’ Geoffrey Boycott, a former England player accused of chemistry-harming egotism in his own time, said on BBC Radio. “Well, they’ve taken it for long enough, and now they’ve said ‘Thank you very much, we will leave it.”’ Pietersen’s departure means little is left of the once-strong South African presence in England’s top order. The former skipper Andrew Strauss retired in 2012; Nick Compton has not played well enough to be picked for the team lately; Jonathan Trott has been laid low by stress-related ailments; and wicket-keeper Matt Prior was dropped at the end of the Ashes series. When England starts anew, it will be a different team, shorn of its most vivid personality. It will also be a duller one. But it may be a happier one — and as Australia has shown in remaking itself from the tense, inhibited team that played so badly in the first half of 2013, that is something that can count for a great deal.

Business   Dispute Over Costs Halts Panama Canal Expansion. Advertisement Advertisement By REUTERSFEB. 7, 2014 The construction companies working to widen the Panama Canal and the waterway’s administrator each made new proposals aimed at ending a dispute over $1.6 billion in cost overruns that has shut down the project. Grupo Unidos Por El Canal, led by the Spanish builder Sacyr, said it wanted to delay making a $784 million payment until the end of the dispute to free up money to finish the project. The Canal Authority said it had sent the consortium a counterproposal based “on the parties contributing financial resources to resume work as soon as possible.” The head of the authority, Jorge Quijano, said the agency was ready to pull the plug on the consortium’s contract unless a deal was reached quickly. He said he had held general talks with other construction companies. Lenders to the project toured the site on Friday and were briefed on the work stoppage. The canal authority has disbursed the $2.3 billion lent by the group of development banks for the project. If the talks fail, the agency could ask the insurer Zurich North America to terminate the contract with the consortium, which also includes Italy’s Salini Impregilo, Jan De Nul of Belgium and Panama’s Constructura Urbana, a canal official familiar with the process said.

Foreign   1914: Barnyard Gaiety at the Paris Poultry Show. Advertisement The President of the French Republic yesterday afternoon opened the Fifteenth International Exhibition of the Société des Aviculteurs Français, better known to Anglo-Saxons as the Paris Poultry Show. The show is being held in one of the wings of the Grand Palais, which from now until Monday next will resound with the noise and gaiety peculiar to the barnyard. To judge from the hundreds of models of incubators at the show, one might imagine for a moment that all life was a mechanical affair, depending upon a box with heat in it. The Paris Poultry Society is looked upon by the Government as of “public usefulness,” and the President of the Republic, the Minister of Agriculture and other officials give prizes, some of which are worth winning, and attract exhibitors from England, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. M. Jules Méline, the Senator, is president of the society, and among the list of members of the committee are: Vicomtesse du Bern de Boislandry, Comte de Pontbriand, M. Decker-David, Baronne de Reviers de Mauny, Mme. de Saint-Albin, Marquise de Sainte-Marie d’Agneaux, Comte d’Alsace, Vicomte P. d’Applaincourt, Marquis de Dampierre and Comte Delamarre. The present exhibition, although perhaps less extensive than some others held during the year, is of great value from a technical point of view for breeders. It also interests the public, for it is amusing and also a practical object-lesson for those who wish to know something about raising poultry and practising economy in their own homes. To judge from the hundreds of models of incubators at the show, one might imagine for a moment that all life was a mechanical affair, depending upon a box with heat in it — not too much and not too little. And everything is done automatically. The architectural displays of poultry houses and yards are somewhat disappointing, and the designs seem to be the same as in former years. There is very little art or beauty shown in the devices offered. — The New York Herald, European edition, Jan. 30, 1914  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Foreign   Anne Heyman, Who Rescued Rwandan Orphans, Dies at 52. Advertisement Advertisement By DOUGLAS MARTINFEB. 8, 2014 When Anne Heyman learned in 2005 that the genocide in Rwanda had orphaned 1.2 million children, she saw a glimpse of salvation for the country in the experience of Israel. “It popped out of my head: They should build youth villages,” she told The New York Times last year. Ms. Heyman, a South African-born lawyer who had given up her legal career in New York to devote herself to philanthropy, was thinking of how Israel, as a new nation state in the late 1940s, had welcomed and cared for tens of thousands of children who had been orphaned by the Holocaust. The Israelis set up residential communities called youth villages to nurture them. “Israel had a solution to the orphan problem,” Ms. Heyman, a supporter of Jewish causes, told The Jerusalem Post last year. “Without a systemic solution, this is a problem that won’t solve itself.” Ms. Heyman knew no one in Rwanda and little about the country, but she plowed ahead, raising more than $12 million; recruiting expert help from Rwanda, Israel and the United States; winning the support of the Rwandan government; and acquiring 144 acres in a setting of lakes and hills in eastern Rwanda. She then built a village of 32 houses for orphaned teenagers, setting it high on a hill, she said, “because children need to see far to go far.” She died on Jan. 31 at a hospital in Delray Beach, Fla., after falling from a horse while competing in a masters jumper competition at the Palm Beach International Equestrian Center in Wellington, Fla. She was 52. The cause was cardiac arrest brought on by a head injury, said Marisha Mistry, a spokeswoman for Liquidnet, an Internet stock-trading company founded by Ms. Heyman’s husband, Seth Merrin. Ms. Heyman had homes in Florida, Manhattan, Westchester County, N.Y., and Israel. When the village for orphans opened in 2008, a long line of teenagers, alone and shattered, stood in the blazing sun holding paper bags containing all their possessions. Entire families of some had been wiped out, and they had no photographs. Some did not know their birthdays, or even what their real names were. At first, almost all who came had been orphaned by the genocide committed in 1994 by ethnic Hutus against the minority Tutsis and the Tutsis’ moderate Hutu supporters. Later, children of parents who had died of AIDS began arriving. Other vulnerable children were also taken in. Advertisement Ethiopian Jews who had grown up at a youth camp in Israel were the first counselors. Housemothers were hired locally to make the houses into homes, often the first the youths had known. Many of the women had lost their husbands and children to genocide. Today the village houses about 500 youths, who go to high school, work on a farm, learn trades, record gospel music and, most of all, feel a sense of belonging. The camp was named Agahozo-Shalom Youth Village. “Agahozo” is a Kinyarwanda word meaning “a place where tears are dried.” Shalom is Hebrew for peace. Reflecting this thought, residents do not identify themselves along tribal lines. Ms. Heyman, who made Hebrew the first language of her own children in New York, saw Agahozo-Shalom as an expression of her Zionist ideals. “It is a way for us to share those values with the non-Jewish world,” she told The Jerusalem Report in 2007. Emmanuel Nkundunkundiye, 21, a recent graduate of the village school, told the Jewish American newspaper The Forward, “The Holocaust is the same history that we face, the same tragedy.” Anne Elaine Heyman was born in Pretoria, South Africa, on June 16, 1961, the second of four children, and was raised in Cape Town. She moved with her family to Boston at 15 and became active in Young Judea, a Zionist youth movement. She spent a year of high school in Israel in a Young Judea program and met her future husband there. She is survived by him; their sons Jason and Jonathan; their daughter, Jenna; and her parents, Sydney and Hermia Heyman. Advertisement Ms. Heyman graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1982, then spent another year in Israel before going to George Washington University Law School. In 1984, she transferred to Columbia Law School and graduated the next year. After two years of private practice, she became an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, prosecuting white-collar crime. She quit to devote herself to her family after her son Jonathan was born in 1994. Ms. Heyman began her career as an activist and philanthropist while at home with her children. She volunteered for Dorot, a Manhattan-based organization that serves the elderly, and became its chairwoman. One of her first steps in her Rwandan mission was linking up with the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which had set up youth villages in the Americas, Europe and Africa. Her principal model was the village of Yemin Orde, one of 50 youth villages in Israel. It has taken in orphans and other needy children from around the world. She also built one of the largest solar energy plants in sub-Saharan Africa; it contributes power to the rest of Rwanda as well. Ms. Heyman had plans to make the village self-sustaining, so that major western donors, like her husband’s company, would not always be needed. Called “Mom,” “Grandmother” and an angel by the youths, she came to the village four or five times a year, staying for several days or more. Agahozo-Shalom’s announcement of Ms. Heyman’s death quoted a Rwandan proverb: “Death is nothing so long as one can survive through one’s children.” A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2014, on page A28 of the New York edition with the headline: Anne Heyman, 52, Rwanda Rescuer, Dies.

Travel   Feasts for the Eyes, and the Palate, in Xian, China. Advertisement Advertisement By PERRI KLASSFEB. 7, 2014 On the “Muslim Street” in the Chinese city of Xian stands a bronze tableau in honor of street food. There, on a crowded lane packed with stalls selling Islamic-Chinese cuisine — lamb dumplings, mutton soup, pancakes and mung bean noodles — tourists can pose with statues of a soup seller and his customers. It’s a photo opportunity that brings together Xian’s two most famous tourist drawing cards: life-size human replicas and superb dumplings. Each year, thousands of tour groups swing through Xian in the central part of the country, one of the four ancient capitals of China. The main draw is the site housing 8,000 buried terra-cotta warriors, the life-size standing figures that Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of unified China, ordered to be created and buried to guard his tomb and fight his battles in the imperial afterlife. It’s perfectly possible to zoom in and out of Xian, stopping only to see the warriors in their open-air museum, and be served the characteristic “dumpling feast”: a high-end celebration of local dumpling culture that can include dozens of morsels, savory and sweet; fried, steamed and boiled; some shaped like leaves, others like flowers and frogs. But Xian, with its millenniums of Chinese history on display, is a remarkable place to spend more than a couple of days. Sights range from two splendid imperial tombs to the syncretic architecture of Chinese Islam at its finest, to an elegant Buddhist pagoda, all in the modern Chinese urban context of a city of about eight million people, replete with aggressive traffic, plentiful construction and bustling luxury shopping malls. One cold winter evening, my husband, our teenage son and I took the overnight “soft sleeper” train from Beijing to Xian. Our aim was a trip that would build on the warriors — and the dumplings — and let us explore the past and present of the city. The tiny train compartment was cozy, with comforters and pillows, and grassy cups of hot tea brought to us in the morning, shortly before the train pulled into the Xian station right up against the largely intact 14th-century city walls. We stayed at a residence hotel with small self-contained apartments in the historic center, near the Muslim quarter, and close to two famous 14th-century towers, the Bell Tower and the Drum Tower, both of which were completely covered in scaffolding. We quickly discovered that though we were just a short walk away from the famous delicacies of the Muslim Street (its formal name is Beiyuanmen Street), we were even closer to the rich possibilities of another small food street across from the hotel, which we quickly came to regard as our own. This street, completely lacking in historic character — or statues — had street vendors with steamers full of dumplings stuffed with glutinous rice, a man who hacked huge grilled scallion-flecked flatbreads into squares, and barbecuers with small grills on which marinated shredded pork and chicken sizzled. Advertisement On the Muslim Street, we sampled Islamic Chinese food, which completely eschews pork and relies instead on lamb and mutton, as well as glutinous noodles made from mung bean flour. Women made scallion-filled pancakes to order on griddles (you could also get your pancake filled with yellow chives or with spiced ground meat). We stepped into a storefront to eat our first bowls of paomo, perhaps the most characteristic Xian dish of all: flatbread crumbled into a rich mutton soup. Xian, the eastern end of the old Silk Road, has long been important for Muslims and Buddhists, emperors and traders. The Great Mosque of Xian was founded in 742, not so long after Islam took root in China. The mosque, rebuilt over the centuries, is notable for its Chinese architecture — a minaret that strongly resembles a pagoda, and pavilions decorated in bright ornamental ceramics. As we explored, afternoon prayers let out, and the courtyard filled with men in skullcaps. Right off the Muslim Street lies the palace complex of a Ming dynasty nobleman, Gao Yue Song, who rose to greatness 400 years ago by placing second in the Confucian imperial examination; a wall plaque at the house celebrates his brilliance as a 12-year-old test taker. We wandered through the tranquil, rambling house, presented as a “scholar’s residence,” with its succession of rooms and courtyards. Advertisement The next day, it was time for Xian’s main attraction: the terra-cotta warriors. An hourlong bus ride took us into the countryside, past universities and spas; the area is famous for its natural beauty and healing springs. The Museum of Qin Terra-Cotta Warriors and Horses is laid out as a series of huge buildings, reminiscent of airplane hangars, that extend over the three main trenches where the warriors were excavated after they were discovered in 1974. Pit 1 features thousands of the life-size clay warriors lined up in rows, while Pit 2 has a smaller group, including chariots and horses. In the Pit 3 building, you can get close to individual warriors in glass cases. The museum is, without question, a strange and wonderful place to visit, whether you prefer to reflect upon the vanity of emperors, the skill of the terra-cotta manufacturers — who managed to give the soldiers distinctive personalities — or upon the lives and longings of the peons who fought the imperial wars. The next day, we had breakfast in the nameless food alley across from our hotel, where one particularly enterprising vendor with a grill built on to a bicycle cart made grilled chicken sandwiches topped with a fried egg and served on buns of puffy white Chinese bread slathered with two kinds of spicy bean sauce. Then we went in search of an entrance that would take us up on the Xian city walls. Soon we found ourselves wandering through a part of the old city that is lined with stores and stalls selling calligraphy supplies: inks, ink pots, brushes and seals. On the walls, we walked along a piece of the old city circumference, from guardhouse to guardhouse, passing bicycle rental facilities, where more ambitious visitors can circumnavigate the eight-mile distance on two wheels. russia mongolia Beijing N.Korea S.Korea Xian japan Shanghai china taiwan Hong Kong South China Sea Later, we took a taxi to the Big Wild Goose Pagoda, a Buddhist temple dating to A.D. 652. The pagoda is surrounded by pavilions with stone carvings, many of them celebrating the journeys of the scholar Xuanzang, a seventh-century Buddhist monk who traveled all over China and then on to India, in search of wisdom and sacred Buddhist texts, which the pagoda was originally built to house. We climbed the interior stairs, up the seven levels, and looked out over the modern city of Xian. On our last day, we visited the Hanyangling tombs, another lavish imperial burial site, this one from the Han dynasty emperor Liu Qi, who reigned from 156 to 141 B.C., and his Empress Wang. This emperor was again buried with terra-cotta figurines — but they were very different, both in scale and in scope, from the infantry, archers, officers and charioteers who make up the more famous terra-cotta army. For one thing, the figures at the Hanyangling tombs are doll-size, and include serried ranks of miniature sheep and goats and cows and pigs, presumably sent into the afterlife as a food source. In the enormous underground museum, you peer into the dim tomb compartments at groups of human figures or alternatively, at underground herds of livestock. Advertisement The emperor’s insistence on eating well underground (he was buried with figurines representing cooks and servants as well as all that meat on the hoof) is well reflected in the food offerings of Xian. We had dinner one night at Tong Sheng, a restaurant devoted to a higher-end version of paomo, and another night at the Xian Hotel, in a vast dining room of somewhat tattered elegance. But the most interesting food is bought — and eaten — outside. Skewers of highly spiced lamb; cold, sour liang ping noodles; ground meat sandwiches, sweet potato fritters; hand-pulled Xian noodles with chile sauce and cilantro; steamed sticky rice on skewers with sweet sauce and peanuts, mutton soup dumplings. There were also nuts and dried fruit; the Muslim Street, in particular, featured store after store with machines sorting walnuts by size, with arrays of dates arranged by value, and vivid orange persimmons available by the box. On our last morning, when we went out to buy our breakfast sandwiches from the man with the grill on his bicycle cart, he handed me my sandwich and said, “Tomorrow?” In fact, I could have wished for another couple of days in Xian; there was still so much more to explore in this city that deserves to be more fully seen and tasted. IF YOU GO Our train travel was arranged for us by Yellow River Travel, yellowrivertravel.com. We also found this website very useful in planning train travel in China, and figuring out the different kinds of trains and bookings: seat61.com/China.htm#.UUwjA1f8nIU.

Business   Seattle Gets Its Own Tech Bus Protest. Advertisement @jseattle Gentrification protestors blocking MS Connectors this AM on Bellevue http://t.co/g3aINd1rF4 — Sean Maguire (@maguiresean) 10 Feb 14 SEATTLE — This city’s technology scene, though vibrant, is significantly smaller than that of its cousin to the south, the San Francisco Bay Area. So, too, it seems, are Seattle’s anti-gentrification protests. On Monday, Seattle got a flavor of the demonstrations that have popped up in San Francisco in recent months, in which activists blockaded (and, in one case, vandalized) private buses operated by Google and other technology employers. The San Francisco protests focused on the buses, which pick up the workers at city bus stops and shuttle them to their offices in the region. But the protests were also expressions of broader resentment at the wealth transforming San Francisco. A dozen or so protestors turned up in San Francisco at one protest in December, or at least enough to surround a large coach on a couple of its sides. In Seattle, a much smaller group of activists managed to block the path of several shuttles during the Monday morning commute that normally carry Microsoft workers to the company’s suburban headquarters. According to an account in the Capitol Hill Seattle Blog, two masked protesters holding a banner reading “Gentrification Stops Here” stood in front of a Microsoft Connector shuttle around 8:40 A.M. in the city’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. The protesters, photographs of whom were posted on Twitter, prevented the shuttle from moving, along with other shuttles that arrived later. An account of the demonstration on an anarchist Web site in Seattle said a “small group” of protesters were involved in the action. It included pictures that appeared to show at least four people involved in the blockade. A flier handed out by protesters at the event asked people to help fight development in Seattle. “The Connector bus helps Microsoft draw young employees into its ranks by allowing them to live in hip neighborhoods,” it read, according to a copy posted on Twitter. “This functions nicely within the city’s ongoing (and so far quite successful) project to shape Seattle into an upscale yuppie playground.” @jseattle Looks like the protestors have left now, they were handing out these: http://t.co/VVJwyBREoD — Sean Maguire (@maguiresean) 10 Feb 14 @jseattle backside: http://t.co/wRcgCdPs1X — Sean Maguire (@maguiresean) 10 Feb 14 A spokesman for Microsoft didn’t respond to a request for comment on the protest.

The tribunal which took upon itself so momentous a responsibility was representative of the International Academy of Dancing Masters, and its task not only involved the selection of two new dances from a number of compositions, but also the definition of and compilation of rules for the new steps. The furlana and the Ta-Tao were definitely chosen to succeed the tango and the maxixe. 1939: Britain Rejects Home Demands LONDON — The British government disclosed today [Feb. 10] that it would not sacrifice vital strategic interests of the British Empire in the Near and Middle East by maintaining a Jewish National Home in Palestine, ‘‘at the point of a bayonet.’’ Britain’s future policy for the Holy Land was sketched briefly and politely but bluntly to the Jewish delegation at the Palestine conference in London, by Malcolm MacDonald, Colonial Secretary.

While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life. The same stories that caught the eyes of our generations of editors now offer us insight into the lives and interests of generations of Trib readers.

Sports   On the Road to the Best in Show. Advertisement  The focus of the sporting world is on the Winter Olympics in Sochi these days, but there’s another competition taking over Manhattan. This year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, at Pier 92 and Pier 94 during the day and at Madison Square Garden at night, features an expected 2,845 dogs of all shapes and sizes and fur types. The animals have come from far and wide, battling snow and cold temperatures to have a shot at winning “Best in Show” during the two-day event, which ends with a champion being crowned Tuesday night. On Monday, Nathan, a 3-year-old Bloodhound, won the hound group. Classie, a 4-year-old Miniature Pinscher, placed first in the toy group. Ally, a white Standard Poodle, topped the non-sporting group. Coco Posh, a Cardigan Welsh Corgi, won the herding group. On Tuesday night, the best of the terrier, working and sporting groups will be chosen and then the best in show. A few breeds competing this year that are newly recognized to the American Kennel Club: the Chinook, the Rat Terrier and the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno. For the first time, the dog show has included a day of agility trials, which took place Saturday, and opened the festivities to mixed-breed dogs. Follow the action here Tuesday. You also can watch live streaming of the event, courtesy of the Westminster Kennel Club.  Coco Posh was the first Cardigan Welsh Corgi to win the herding group.

For Kathryn Flesher, it has been pretty mellow so far. The dogs of Westminster are show animals, meaning they are supposed to be in good shape. That makes for very few, if any, medical emergencies, she said. The most common ailment is stress. Even though many of these dogs are seasoned veterans of show life, even they can be a little nervous. — WENDY FRINK   Ok, why is this border collie not inhaling that food? #WKCDogShow http://t.co/fS6c3bPhD2 — Hamilton Pug (@HamiltonPug) 10 Feb 14   Even the most well-trained dog needs a little motivation in the ring to perform. And what is better motivation than food? Jerky and chicken are solid choices. If you’re Hunter, a 5-year-old boxer from Hershey, Pa., you get chicken and sausage. And perhaps the luckiest dog, aptly named Penny, is a 2-year-old Welsh corgi. She dines on hot dogs and mozzarella sticks. — WENDY FRINK    Reme, short for Remember, was born on Sept. 11 in 2010.

Well, if you’re Buddha, a 4-year-old Dogue de Bordeaux from Colorado, you claim an entire row of seats aboard a flight and just sleep, awaking every now and again to have your head rubbed and the slobber wiped from your mouth.

Travel   Strollers Are the Latest Airport Amenity. Advertisement Families flying with very young children can now take advantage of a growing trend: A number of airports are providing loaner strollers to ease the stress of traveling. Frankfurt Airport in Germany introduced free strollers in October as part of its “Great to have you here!” program. Charles de Gaulle, serving Paris, introduced 60 strollers at Terminal 2E, and there are plans to offer additional ones at all terminals. Zurich and Copenhagen airports give parents a breather before flights by providing playrooms; strollers are also offered. Changi Airport in Singapore offers complimentary strollers in its three terminals. Countries in the Middle East established the trend: Emirates offered several umbrella-fold Maclaren buggies at every airline gate in Terminal 3 at the Dubai International Airport in July 2012. Maclaren strollers will be introduced at a yet unnamed major airport hub in the United States by the end of this year, a Maclaren spokeswoman said.

Business   The Day the Internet Didn’t Fight Back. Advertisement Updated: This post now includes comment from Senator Dianne Feinstein’s office and a protest organizer. | So much for mass protest. A consortium of Internet and privacy activists had long promoted Feb. 11 as the day the Internet would collectively stand up and shout down surveillance by the National Security Agency. The group called Tuesday, “The Day We Fight Back,” and encouraged websites to join an online campaign modeled after protests against the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect I.P. Act two years ago, when sites like Reddit and Wikipedia and companies like Google and Facebook helped successfully topple antipiracy legislation. Instead, the protest on Tuesday barely registered. Wikipedia did not participate. Reddit — which went offline for 12 hours during the protests two years ago — added an inconspicuous banner to its homepage. Sites like Tumblr, Mozilla and DuckDuckGo, which were listed as organizers, did not include the banner on their homepages. The most vocal protesters were the usual suspects: activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Greenpeace. The eight major technology companies — Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AOL, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo and LinkedIn — that joined forces in December in a public campaign to “reform government surveillance” only participated Tuesday insofar as having a joint website flash the protest banner. The difference may be explained by the fact that two years ago, the Internet powerhouses were trying to halt new legislation. On Tuesday, people were being asked to reverse a secret, multi-billion dollar surveillance effort by five countries that has been in place for nearly a decade. And unlike 2012, when the goal was simply to block the passage of new bills, the goal of the protests on Tuesday were more muddled. This time around, participants were urged to flash a banner on their sites that urged visitors to call their congressional representative in support of the U.S.A. Freedom Act — a bill sponsored by Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, which seeks to reform the N.S.A.’s metadata database. They were also asked to oppose the FISA Improvements Act, a bill proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein that would help legalize the N.S.A.’s metadata collection program. All was not lost. By late Tuesday, some 70,000 calls had been placed to legislators and roughly 150,000 people had sent their representatives an email. Most of those were directed to Senator Dianne Feinstein. Brian Weiss, a spokesman for Senator Feinstein said that their Washington office had received a higher volume of calls Tuesday, but would not say how many calls the office received or even give a range. Several privacy activists took issue with the characterization that the protest was unsuccessful. “Yesterday, we sought to make a dent, while laying a foundation for escalation,” David Segal, executive director of Demand Progress, one of the protest organizers wrote in an e-mail. “In those respects it was a tremendous success, and met every goal we’d set for it.” Mr. Segal added, “To mark all organizing a success or failure by measuring it against the single biggest online activist moment ever is ridiculous.” Others pointed to the fact that a Reddit post about the protest generated over 3,500 comments. Though most of those comments read like more derogatory versions of this one: “Online petitions. The very least you can do, without doing nothing.” Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Delhi Chief Minister Accuses Reliance Industries Chairman and Government Officials of Collusion. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi, on Tuesday ordered the filing of a criminal complaint against Mukesh Ambani, the richest businessman in India, and the petroleum and natural gas minister, M. Veerappa Moily, to look into whether the two men and others colluded to keep gas prices high. At a news conference, Mr. Kejriwal said three former bureaucrats and a senior Supreme Court lawyer had alleged that Reliance Industries, Mr. Ambani’s company, was getting help from government officials, including Mr. Moily, to keep Reliance Industries’ natural gas production deliberately low. Mr. Kejriwal said the complaint would also name Murali Deora, a former petroleum minister, V.K. Sibal, the former director general of hydrocarbons in the ministry of petroleum, and others. Reliance Industries runs production in the D6 block of the Krishna-Godavari Basin off India’s east coast, which was estimated to have huge reserves. Reliance Industries has long argued that its natural gas output from that block has fallen because extraction has been more difficult than expected. Reliance Industries said in a statement late Tuesday night that Mr. Kejriwal’s allegations were “completely baseless and devoid of any merit or substance whatsoever.” The company also said it would explore all its legal options. Last year, the central government agreed to allow gas producers, including Reliance Industries, to raise natural gas prices this April. The price increase would lead to a windfall of 1.2 trillion rupees, or $19.3 billion, for Reliance Industries while pushing up the costs of transportation, fertilizer and electricity, Mr. Kejriwal contended. “All this will have a destabilizing effect on the economy,” said Mr. Kejriwal. He also criticized Reliance Industries for its lack of transparency, referring to the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General that said Reliance Industries and other gas producers had not fully cooperated with audits of natural gas blocks. Mr. Moily told reporters in New Delhi, “We should sympathize with his ignorance. He doesn’t know how government runs. Norms are followed. There is a system in fixing prices.” A Congress Party spokesman, Ajay Maken, said at a news conference, “We are not against any investigation. There should not be any investigation for political purposes. Any investigation should be in judicial and constitutional jurisdiction”. Mr. Kejriwal’s criminal complaint is an extension of the allegations he leveled against Reliance Industries in October 2012, when he was an anticorruption activist. Back then, he accused the Reliance Industries of receiving favorable terms from the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in 2000 to extract gas from the Krishna-Godavari Basin. At the time, the company denied the accusations in a statement. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   The Archaeology of the Stars. Advertisement Advertisement By CURTIS BRAINARDFEB. 10, 2014 Four years ago, Anna Frebel, a young astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found an ancient star in a neighboring galaxy whose chemical composition proved nearly identical to some unusual stars on the outskirts of our own galaxy, which are older than the Milky Way itself. It was a striking discovery, suggesting that the relatively young Milky Way is growing by conquest — “cannibalizing” nearby older dwarf galaxies. And it underscored the importance of a new way of learning how the universe evolved from the Big Bang to the modern cosmos. Traditionally, astronomers study the early universe by looking back in time — peering deeper and deeper into space for vestiges of light from billions of years ago. But in the last decade, Dr. Frebel and others have used powerful telescopes and high-resolution spectroscopes to study the chemical composition of very old stars closer to home, in the Milky Way’s halo, producing a wealth of information about the creation of elements and the formation of the first stars and galaxies. These astronomers are like Egyptologists combing the desert for relics of bygone civilizations, and call themselves stellar archaeologists. Their work relies on the fact that the rare, primordial stars they are looking for have very few atoms heavier than hydrogen and helium, the gases from which they came together. By contrast, our sun and other relatively young stars are rich in other elements, which astronomers collectively refer to as metals. Advertisement Astronomers believe that some of the old stars formed from the chemically enriched dust left over from the explosive deaths of the very first generation of stars, and their atmospheres contain important information about their forebears, like DNA passed from parent to offspring. The hunt for these scarce antiquities goes back to the early 1950s, when scientists recognized that not all stars have the same metal-rich chemical composition as the sun. “At the time, they didn’t know what to do with the metal-poor stars,” Dr. Frebel, 33, said. But astronomers have since established what she called “a framework for the chemical evolution of the universe.” Building Blocks The first stars were made up entirely of hydrogen, helium and negligible traces of lithium. With no heavy elements to cool the gas clouds, they grew massive, rapidly burned through their fuel and exploded in supernovas. During various burning stages of those first stars’ evolution, before and after they exploded, their intense heat fused the hydrogen and helium atoms into heavier elements — the first metals — which in turn enabled the formation of long-lived, low-mass stars. Some of those early second- and third-generation stars eventually made their way to our corner of the universe, where they long remained unnoticed by astronomers among a sea of even younger stars. Most of the stars we see in the sky are relatively rich in metals like iron and are known as Population I stars because they were once thought to be the only type existing. That changed in 1951, when the astronomers Joseph W. Chamberlain and Lawrence H. Aller found the first two Population II stars, with about one three-hundredth the amount of iron as our sun. Three decades later, in 1984, two astronomers at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia, John Norris and Mike Bessell, chanced upon a star with just one ten-thousandth the iron abundance of the sun. Iron content closely corresponds to what astronomers call metallicity, which is expressed on a logarithmic scale: Minus 2.0 is one-hundredth the iron abundance of the sun, –3.0 is one-thousandth, and so on. The newly discovered star was –4.0. Advertisement It was a serendipitous find, according to Dr. Norris, who along with Dr. Bessell would become a Ph.D. adviser to Dr. Frebel. Astronomers are searching for rare, very old stars that contain hints about the chemical evolution of the universe. THE MILKY WAY GALAXY POPULATION III STARS POPULATION II STARS POPULATION I STARS The first stars formed from primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium, hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. The heavier elements of the periodic table, called “metals” by astronomers, did not yet exist, except for traces of lithium. Nuclear fusion inside the stars created the elements through iron, and even heavier elements were created when the massive, short-lived stars exploded in supernovas. Cast into space, the new metals began the chemical enrichment of the universe. Metal-poor stars formed from the scattered remains of the first stars, and contain small amounts of metals. Astronomers detect elements in distant stars by measuring the amount of starlight received at different wavelengths. The resulting spectrum is often used to measure the relative abundance of iron compared with hydrogen. HE 1327-2326, a star near the tail of the constellation Hydra, is one of the most iron-poor stars yet found, with an abundance of iron about 1/250,000 that of the Sun. Metal-rich stars like the sun have been enriched by many previous generations of stars, and have higher percentages of metals. For example, the sun is about 98.6 percent hydrogen and helium, and has a much higher proportion of iron than a metal-poor star like HE 1327-2326. Stars in the halo of the Milky Way tend to have lower metal content than younger stars in the galactic center. Dark patches in the image of the Milky Way are clouds of gas and dust.

Stars in the halo of the Milky Way tend to have lower metal content than younger stars in the galactic center. Dark patches in the image above are clouds of gas and dust.   The sun “It was called CD -38° 245, if you like star names,” Dr. Norris said, “and we knew that we’d gone down to something very pristine, but we also suspected that it was not the end of the story. So we worked hard here and elsewhere to find more metal-poor stars than that, but it wasn’t for almost another 20 years that someone would.” A survey of the southern sky in the 1990s produced a trove of potential metal-poor stars. In 2002, Norbert Christlieb at the University of Hamburg in Germany announced that one of them, 36,000 light-years away in the constellation Phoenix, in the Milky Way’s galactic halo, had a metallicity of –5.2 — a “relic from the dawn of time,” as the journal Nature put it. Shortly after, Dr. Christlieb met Dr. Frebel, then a young undergraduate who was taking time off from her physics studies in Germany to do research at Mount Stromlo, part of Australian National University. “I immediately recognized that she was a very talented student,” Dr. Christlieb said. “We had this idea to explore the brighter stars” in the 1990s survey, “and I asked if she’d be interested in developing methods to find interesting objects. She agreed, and of course her work was very successful.” Dr. Frebel stayed in Australia to continue her doctoral work, and before her degree was even in hand she had found a star with a metallicity of –5.4. Advertisement Until last week, that star was the most iron-poor astronomers had found. Then, on Sunday, astronomers announced a record. In a paper in Nature, Dr. Frebel and a group of colleagues, including Stefan Keller of Australian National University, the lead author, described a star in the Milky Way constellation Hydrus with a metallicity of less than –7.1 (only an upper limit could be determined). The star, SMSS 0313-6708, is presumably very old, perhaps the oldest yet identified. The astronomers who found it estimate that it formed over 13 billion years ago. But they cannot say exactly how old it is. One of the few ways to get a precise age for a star is to find one with radioactive elements like uranium and thorium, whose half-lives are known and can be used — like carbon 14 on earth — to date an object with certainty. Anna Frebel uses light emitted from stars to find the oldest among them. By ROSE EVELETHFEB. 10, 2014 Only about 5 percent of stars are thought to have such a chemical signature. Still, Dr. Frebel described one such star in 2007: a red giant 7,500 light years from Earth that at 13.2 billion years old is one of the two oldest known stars in the universe that have actually been dated. “We would hope for a consistent relationship” between metallicity and age, she said, “but the problem is that the uncertainties are so large and the samples so few that it’s hard to map out.” Advertisement By now, astronomers have found six stars with less than one ten-thousandth of the sun’s iron abundance, –4, and those are the ones that interest them the most. “The signatures in the stars we’ve discovered since 2000 are quite different from what we find in other, what you might call ‘normal’ metal-poor stars,” Dr. Norris said. He and others believe that they could have come only from the supernova of a single first-generation star. Astronomers, Dr. Frebel said, “are finding stars that are over 13 billion years old — what we think are plausible second-generation stars.” She continued: “So now we’re trying to decipher their chemical composition in order to answer questions like ‘How massive were the first stars? How many were there? How and where were the elements produced? How did they explode? And how did the first low-mass stars form?’ ” Seeking Cosmic Relics After Dr. Frebel locates a metal-poor star that she wants to analyze in detail, she heads for Las Campanas Observatory, atop a remote peak in the Atacama Desert in Chile. There she stays awake all night with one of the twin Magellan telescopes trained on her target for hours at a time. A high-resolution spectrograph stretches the photons of starlight across the visible wavelength, telling her how many atoms of each element the star contains. Back home, other scientists run computer simulations to see how the data from her observations correspond with different models of the universe’s evolution. The Giant Magellan Telescope, when built, will have a resolving power 10 times greater than the Hubble Space Telescope. The Methuselahs of the cosmos have divulged some tantalizing hints of how it all happened. Their chemical compositions suggest, for instance, that the first supernovas may not have carried as much explosive energy as astronomers once believed. Advertisement In turn, this implies that the first stars may not have been as massive as thought, and that some of the first supernovas “sort of failed,” as Dr. Frebel put it — with much of the star’s material falling back into a black hole rather being ejected into space. Another critical observation is that five of the six known stars with metallicities below –4.0 have unusually high levels of carbon relative to iron. Dr. Frebel said that could be a sign that the element played an important role from the outset, instigating the cooling of interstellar gas that allowed the first low-mass stars to form. On the other hand, one of the stars is not similarly enriched with carbon — suggesting that dust molecules could also have acted as a cooling mechanism. The discovery announced on Sunday supports these conclusions. But six stars are not enough to be sure of anything, so astronomers are counting on a variety of new sky surveys, including Australian National University’s SkyMapper project, which is already producing large new catalogs of stars for study. “It is very exciting that SkyMapper has now shown to be capable of finding these rare, ancient stars,” Dr. Frebel said. “It is already a great achievement for this new survey and promises many great returns in the near future.” When it comes to metal-poor stars, how low can you go? Such remnants of the early universe are uncommon and hard to find, but stellar archaeology is a young field, and new artifacts will undoubtedly come to light. Indeed, stellar archaeologists hope they might find a long-lived low-mass star from the first generation. At the moment these “primes” exist only in theory. But they could be out there, astronomers say, lying in some dark corner of the universe like an undiscovered pharaoh in his tomb, waiting to tell us about life along the banks of the Nile thousands of years before the Common Era.

Business   Comcast Deal Seeks to Unite 2 Cable Giants. Advertisement Comcast announced on Thursday an agreement to acquire Time Warner Cable for more than $45 billion in stock, a deal that would combine the biggest and second-biggest cable television operators in the country. For Comcast, which completed its acquisition of NBC Universal, the television and movie powerhouse, from General Electric less than a year ago, the latest deal would be its second big act to radically reshape the media landscape in the United States. And the merger is almost certain to bring to an end a protracted takeover battle that Charter Communications has been waging for Time Warner Cable. Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, said in a statement on Thursday that Time Warner Cable’s executives “have created a pure-play cable company that, combined with Comcast, has the foundation for future growth.” For Time Warner Cable, the deal provides a neat solution to its problems. It will receive just about the $160-a-share price it said was its true value, and possibly more. It will no longer have to slog ahead with a turnaround plan being run by a new chief executive, Rob Marcus. And it will allow it to become part of the company that is already the dominant force in cable television services. Despite combining the two largest cable operators in the country, a merger may have little impact on consumers. Comcast and Time Warner Cable do not compete directly in any markets. Nonetheless, regulators will surely look carefully at the impact on the deal to consumers, and may also focus on whether the combined company will have additional power in negotiations with cable networks, a recent source of tension in the industry. The two companies said they expected the deal to close by the end of the year. Comcast has about 22 million television customers, according to the National Cable and Telecommunications Association. Time Warner Cable has about 11 million video subscribers, according to people familiar with the company. In a bid to appease antitrust regulators, Comcast is expected say it is willing to divest three million of Time Warner Cable’s roughly 11 million pay television subscribers. It was not immediately clear if Comcast would propose certain markets to divest, but shedding those subscribers should keep Comcast with less than 30 percent national market share for pay television, a level the company believes will satisfy antitrust regulators. Under the terms of the deal, Time Warner Cable shareholders will receive 2.875 shares of newly issued Comcast common stock for each of their shares, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday evening. Based on Comcast’s closing price of $55.24 on Wednesday, that values each Time Warner Cable share at about $158.82 each. If Comcast stock rises on news of the deal, the price could go up, while if the stock falls, it could go down. The deal is subject to approval by both shareholders of both companies. Because it is an all-stock deal with newly issued shares, Comcast will not have to take on any new debt. Should a deal be completed, Time Warner Cable shareholders will own roughly 23 percent of the combined company. For Comcast, the deal, extending its leadership in the cable industry, is another transformative step in the evolution of what is now America’s most influential media company. It comes less than a year after Comcast completed the acquisition of NBC Universal And it will further extend Comcast’s lead as the nation’s largest cable operator. Charter, however, is left in the lurch. Charter is one of the nation’s smaller cable operators, but had big ambitions to compete with Comcast. Last year Liberty Media, the conglomerate backed by billionaire John C. Malone, acquired 27 percent of Charter, and urged the company to pursue deals, a process that could have led Mr. Malone back to the heights of American cable, an industry he once ruled as head of TCI, then the country’s largest operator. Beginning last year, Charter made overtures to Time Warner Cable, privately offering a succession of higher prices, all of which were rejected. Last month, Charter went public with an offer of $132.50 per share for Time Warner Cable, which Mr. Marcus dismissed as inadequate. He countered by saying the company would consider a bid of $160 per share, which Comcast has now nearly matched. On Tuesday, Charter nominated a full slate of directors to Time Warner Cable’s board, its most aggressive move to date. At the same time, Charter was negotiating with Comcast about a deal through which Comcast would acquire certain markets from Time Warner Cable if Charter was about to buy the entire company. Comcast, however, had other plans. Charter may buy the subscribers that Comcast has pledged to divest, giving it added scale but not nearly the boost it had hoped when it set its eyes on acquiring all of Time Warner Cable. Though the companies are set to announce the deal, it could still come undone. Shareholders of either company could vote it down, though that seems unlikely. Charter could still play spoiler with a new bid, though that seems unlikely too, given its limited financial resources. Or Comcast shares could collapse, leading Time Warner Cable shareholders to shun a deal. Advising Comcast are JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Paul J. Taubman, the former top Morgan Stanley deal maker. Davis Polk & Wardwell and Willkie Farr & Gallagher are its legal advisors. Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, Citigroup and Centerview Partners are financial advisers to Time Warner Cable and its board. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are legal advisers. The two companies will hold a conference call at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday morning.

Science   Dental Group Advises Fluoride Toothpaste Before Age 2 Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   Parents should use a tiny smear of fluoride toothpaste to brush baby teeth twice daily as soon as they erupt, instead of waiting until children are older, according to new guidelines by the American Dental Association. That advice overturns the A.D.A.’s decades-old recommendation to start using a pea-size amount at 24 months. Once children are 3 to 6 years old, then the amount should be increased to a pea-size dollop, the updated guidelines say. To fight the rising number of cavities in the very young, the dental group now advises getting a jump-start on prevention. However, they emphasize only the tiniest amount of fluoride toothpaste should be used to minimize the risk of mild discoloration, white spots or streaking of the teeth, a condition called fluorosis that is caused by ingesting fluoride toothpaste at a young age. “We want to minimize the amount of fluoride consumption to reduce the risk of fluorosis while simultaneously adding a preventive tool for kids 2 and under that we haven’t recommended previously,” said Dr. Jonathan Shenkin, a spokesman for the A.D.A. and a pediatric dentist in Augusta, Me. Only a tiny amount of toothpaste should be smeared on the brush since some youngsters are likely to ingest some of the fluoride, he said. The change comes after a systematic review of 17 studies published in The Journal of the American Dental Association this month. It concluded that scientific evidence, though limited in children under age 6 and more robust in older children, demonstrated that fluoride toothpaste is effective in controlling tooth decay, and that “the appropriate amount” should be used “by all children regardless of age.” An early start is crucial, Dr. Shenkin said, because children with dental decay are at greater risk of developing cavities as adults. “By starting earlier, we can effectively reduce a lifetime of disease for a lot of kids.” Dr. Man Wai Ng, the dentist in chief at Boston Children’s Hospital, applauded the new recommendation and said, “It’s a great thing for parents to know: ‘Use a tiny amount of fluoride, and brush two times a day to counter the effects of frequent snacking.’” Most of the children she sees with tooth decay are using “a training toothpaste without fluoride,” she said. The new A.D.A. guidelines stress that children should spit out toothpaste as soon as they are able, but not being able to spit does not preclude the use of a rice-grain-size bit of fluoride toothpaste. Dr. Shenkin has had some 5-year-old patients “still not using a fluoride toothpaste because parents don’t think they can spit it out yet.” The goal is to have parents monitor the amount of toothpaste and to assist in brushing. Children generally cannot properly brush until they have the dexterity to tie their shoes. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, another trade group, has long recommended using just a smear of fluoride toothpaste for children younger than 2 who are at risk for cavities, including those who go to bed with a bottle at night or have a family history of cavities. The best predictor of developing cavities in the future is a history of cavities. Some dentists already counsel parents of children under 2, especially those at high risk, to brush with fluoride. Current labels on toothpaste advise parents of children under 2 to consult a dentist or physician. The labels are meant to direct parents to visit the dentist, Dr. Ng, said, but instead, “parents jump to the conclusion that they shouldn’t be using fluoride toothpaste because their young child isn’t able to spit it out yet.” It’s unclear when and if the labels will change, or what will happen to fluoride-free training toothpastes, which currently are marketed as “safe if swallowed.” Dr. Ng said she hopes that other organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which currently recommends that a pea-size amount of fluoride toothpaste be used starting at age 2, will “follow suit and be consistent with a single set of guidelines.” In that way, “the public will be less confused.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/13/2014, on page A18 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Fluoride Brushing Urged for Children Under 2.

Business   Phrase From Virgil. Advertisement By Bruce Haight Feb 14, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — My, what a surprise! I really wasn’t expecting this, and I’ll bet you weren’t, either. Bruce Haight is back, and he has something special to ask us. If we all give him an enthusiastic “Yes,” this may be the first mass wedding the Internet has ever seen. We’ve seen people propose marriage to a single person in crosswords before, but have we ever seen someone who POPS THE QUESTION to an entire audience of puzzle solvers? What a romantic guy Mr. Haight is. I hope he can afford to keep us all in the manner to which we have become accustomed. We also don’t usually see a themed or even semithemed puzzle on a Friday but, this being Valentine’s Day, I’m guessing that Will Shortz selected Mr. Haight’s puzzle to observe the occasion. What a NEAT IDEA. Stretching across the center of our grid is the Virgil quote “LOVE CONQUERS ALL” and running down the center is the moment we’ve all been waiting to tell our friends about: Mr. Haight POPS THE QUESTION to us. Aww … we’d like a big wedding, Mr. Haight. In nonsemitheme news, we have seven entries making their debuts today, and my favorites among them were READ A BOOK (fortunately, my kids are big readers and never needed me to nag them about that), STAY COOL (no, thanks. I live in the Northeast and would really prefer to be warm at this point) and LAKE POET (such a lovely, evocative name for the group of poets who lived in the lake district of Cumberland and Westmorland in the 19th century). GUEST STAR, OIL TYCOON and LILLIPUT were also nice. Let’s meet the groom, sorry, the constructor: Hi Deb! This is only my second published puzzle — the first one was sacked for bad fill by every reviewer except you [Well, now we know why he proposed. — D.A.] It really did have some bad fill, but it was nice of you to focus mostly on the bright spots. I was introduced to crossword construction by Pete Collins, who coincidentally created the puzzle from two days ago. Thanks, Pete! I’ve also been inspired by Manny Nosowsky — a surgeon who published his first puzzle at age 59 (like me) and went on to become a legend in the crossword industry. My original submission for this puzzle had IT’S GOOD PR for one of the entries, clued as “This will help our image.” I rather liked that one myself, but Will felt it seemed “made up” as a phrase. He liked the rest, though, and I was able to repair the defect with surprisingly little impact on the rest of the grid. The only clue I hated to wave goodbye to was “It may have strings attached” for PUPPETRY at 39 Across. Will didn’t like that one, at least not for a Friday. If I squint really hard, this puzzle grid looks like a diamond ring to me, with four prongs holding the main stone (imagination needed here) and some smaller baguettes — perfect for POPS THE QUESTION. Is anyone buying it? Absolutely, Mr. Haight. We’ll just pop that on our collective finger. Does everyone have their old, new, borrowed and blue stuff for the wedding? Just swap among yourselves if you need something borrowed. Ready to waltz down the aisle, Mr. Haight? Mr. Haight? Hey, where’d he go? Wordplay wishes everyone a warm and happy Valentine’s Day.

Home   Modernism’s Giant Showcase. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN KURUTZFEB. 12, 2014 The dealers who attend the Palm Springs Modernism Show and Sale must luxuriate in their home-field advantage: With its copious midcentury architecture, the city is one big ad for their wares. This year’s show, which is timed to Modernism Week and begins Friday, is the largest in its 14 years. More than 85 exhibitors will be selling furniture, jewelry, pottery, textiles and other items representative of 20th-century design, like a welded steel sculpture by Paul Kasper ($14,000, from Fat ChanceLos Angeles) and a signed lithograph by Alexander Calder ($3,150, from Palette Contemporary Art & Craft). Gerard O’Brien, who owns the Los Angeles-based Reform Gallery, has done the show since its inception. Among his more interesting offerings this year, he said, are a one-of-a-kind Jack Rogers Hopkins chair and wall divider, and a pair of John Follis suede Solo chairs from 1976 that “look like they came out of Halston’s apartment.” The Hopkins piece is $75,000, a hefty price. But where else would it find a buyer than Palm Springs, Calif.? “It’s a city where people who come are predisposed to modernism,” Mr. O’Brien said. Information: dolphinfairs.com/palmsprings.

Politics   In PracticeTracking the Affordable Care Act. View All Posts » BOSTON — Massachusetts officials said Thursday that they have an additional three months to bring the state’s health care system in line with the national Affordable Care Act. The waiver, which was granted by federal officials on Wednesday, will allow the state to keep more than 100,000 people on state-run health insurance plans that do not comply with the requirements of the new law until June 30. “We are determined to get this project back on track and get people out of this temporary coverage plan and transition to the program that they belong in,” said Sarah Iselin, a health insurance executive who was appointed last week by Gov. Deval Patrick to oversee repairs to the state’s troubled efforts to update its online health insurance exchange so it complies with the federal law. Massachusetts created its own online marketplace for health insurance when it passed a health care overhaul in 2006. That website functioned as intended until it was changed last fall to bring it up to date with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The site had problems determining whether many applicants were eligibile for the federal subsidies, and left tens of thousands of applications to be processed by hand. Unable to immediately enroll applicants in new, private plans under the Affordable Care Act, state officials extended existing state coverage for about 124,000 individuals, and granted temporary state coverage to about 30,000 new applicants. Those individuals were supposed to move onto new plans by March. 31; the federal waiver gives officials another three months to do that. “This is not a position we wanted to be in,” said Ms. Iselin, who said there was a backlog of an additional 50,000 applications that had yet to be processed. A health care technology firm, Optum, has been hired by the state to help process those applications and improve the functionality of the exchange website. Last week, state officials released a report by an outside technology firm, Mitre Corporation, that criticized both the state and its principal contractor, CGI, for the failure of Massachusetts’ new health exchange website. The report said that state organizations leading the website’s overhaul lacked a “unified vision” for the project and that CGI lacked adequate expertise, managed the project poorly, lost data and failed to do enough testing before the launch of the new site. The problems have been embarrassing to proponents of the federal health care overhaul who have pointed to Massachusetts as a successful implementation of a health exchange and an individual mandate. Ms. Iselin said that part of the challenge here was that Massachusetts, which had the only state insurance marketplace before the Affordable Care Act was passed, was not simply extending coverage to new individuals but moving people from its old system to a new one. “In some ways, it’s made this part of implementing the A.C.A. more complex for us than other places that didn’t have the same long history of these incremental expansions,” she said. The state originally asked for a six-month extension. Ms Iselin said it was “too soon too tell” whether they would need more than the three months they got.

Travel   Learning the Language of Restaurant Week. Advertisement A new video campaign launched by NYC & Company, New York’s marketing and tourism organization, offers a comedic look at the orthoepic challenges of NYC Restaurant Week. The six-video series (watch a sample above) features commuters in Grand Central Terminal being asked to pronounce international dining-related phrases like “prix fixe,” undoubtedly an important skill for diners as prix fixe menus are the foundation on which the week’s culinary bargains are based. But the campaign is more than an entertaining public service message — it’s also an opportunity to show how the city’s cuisine has been inspired by so many different languages and traditions, Fred Dixon, the interim chief executive of NYC & Company, said in a press release. Still, watching people try to pronounce “sfogliatelle,” is just plain funny. Restaurant week runs Feb. 17 through March 7 and offers prix fixe lunches and dinners (for $25 and $38, not including beverages, tax and tip) at almost 300 establishments across the five boroughs.

By Julian Lim Feb 15, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — My blogdom for a toehold in this puzzle. That was my first thought when I looked over Julian Lim’s offering. I had a tough time breaking in, but when I finally made some headway, I really liked this one. Some solvers don’t enjoy it, but thank goodness for pop culture. I was able to guess SOUP NAZI at 23 Down, CEELO Green at 62 Across and Steely Dan’s liar KATY at 36 Across. That gave me enough to continue, but oh man, that cluing. There’s nothing like trying to decipher a misdirected clue like “Where to read a plot summary?” for GRAVESTONE to remind you that it’s Saturday and that you will need all your resources to get through this. At least Mr. Lim opened his puzzle with the very clever “Position papers?” for KAMA SUTRA to cheer us up. There is a bit of less-than-optimal stuff in here, like AN ILL and -IST, but on the upside, Mr. Lim’s puzzle has a whopping 13 unique entries. Of those, my favorites were HOUSE M.D., KAMA SUTRA, SOUP NAZI, RATION OUT and ST. BONIFACE. I also really enjoyed SO LAST YEAR, EGOMANIAC, PENNY ANTE and ZEN GARDEN. Let’s chat with Mr. Lim: I constructed this puzzle almost three years ago, and my main memory of it is having a Titanic struggle completing the southwest and northeast corners after starting to fill the grid from the center. As a result, I think there’s more ugly short stuff than I’d like in a themeless I’d construct today, particularly the yucky AN ILL. C’est la vie. I am happy that KAMA SUTRA made it into print with my original clue, which still kind of amuses me. Or maybe I’m just easily amused. The eagle-eyed may have noticed that both this themeless and my last have drug names debuted in them (CIALIS and now PAXIL) — I’m not shilling for any drug companies though, honest! On the other hand, I am generally plugging any graphic novelists/novels that find their way into my grids, so if you haven’t read anything by ALAN MOORE, please do so immediately. “KATY Lied” is the 1975 album by Steely Dan, and the titular liar is mentioned in the song “Dr. Wu”: Your thoughts?

Foreign   South China Sea Tensions a Backdrop to Kerry’s China Visit. Advertisement   Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, took exception on Friday to a remark a day earlier by Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations of the United States Navy. Admiral Greenert said the United States would fulfill its obligations under a mutual defense treaty to help the Philippines if it came under attack, although the admiral was careful not to say how much help might be provided. Ms. Hua responded on Friday afternoon that, “The U.S., who is not a party concerned in the South China Sea dispute, should honor its commitment of not taking sides on the territorial sovereignty issue, be discreet in word and deed and do more for peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific, rather than the opposite.” China has been increasingly assertive in the last few years in claiming islands, shoals and fishing grounds in the South China Sea, including near the Philippines and south almost to the coast of Borneo. When asked on Thursday during a visit to the Philippines whether the United States would help if China attacked as part of a dispute in the South China Sea, Admiral Greenert replied that, “Of course we would help you, I don’t know what that help would be specifically – we have an obligation because we have a treaty,” Admiral Greenert said. At a separate press briefing on Friday evening, Secretary of State John Kerry lent support to the Philippines call for South China Sea issues to be resolved according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. “With respect to the South China Sea, it’s important to resolve these differences in a peaceful, non-confrontational way that honors the law of the sea and honors the rule of law itself,” he said, according to a State Department transcript. Beijing officials have rejected using the United Nations Convention, although China is a signatory, and have said that they prefer bilateral talks instead with each country, as such negotiations give them considerable leverage over each of their much smaller neighbors.China is already unhappy after President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines last week cited Nazi Germany’s demands for Czech territory in 1938 in calling for international support for his country in resisting China’s territorial claims off the west coast of his country. Hong Lei, another Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, responded at a briefing on Feb. 7 by pointing out that China had fought against the Axis during World War II. “It is inconceivable and unreasonable to place China-Philippines South China Sea disputes in the same category with the WWII history,” he said. “The Chinese side is shocked at and dissatisfied with the remarks from the Philippine side.” On Feb. 8, Mr. Hong also denounced Daniel R. Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, for questioning China’s recent assertions of maritime sovereignty not just to the waters near Philippines but almost to the shores of Malaysian Borneo. “China’s rights and interests in the South China Sea are formed in history and protected by international law,” Mr. Hong said. “China stays committed to resolving maritime disputes with countries directly concerned through negotiation and consultation.” During the interview last week, President Aquino said that no one should worry that expressions of support by the United States would embolden the Philippines to take an overly confrontational stance toward China, because the Philippines is well aware that its military is far weaker than China’s. A survey conducted in December and released in stages in the Philippines over the last two weeks indicated that Mr. Aquino may have been tapping into deep worries there about China’s territorial ambitions. Filipinos expressed greater satisfaction with his administration’s defending of the country’s territorial rights and foreign policy than with any other national policy. In his interview on Feb. 7 with The New York Times, Mr. Aquino strongly asserted that he would not back down from his country’s longstanding claims to islands and atolls off its shores, even though he readily acknowledged that the Philippines has scant military force to resist China’s increasingly vocal expression of territorial ambitions and steady military buildup. “One is perplexed at what China’s intentions are — I don’t think that there is any expert that can come up with conclusions that are beyond refute,” he said. IHS Jane’s, a defense industry consulting and analysis company, estimated earlier this month that by next year, China will be spending more on its military than Germany, France and Britain combined. But while public opinion tends to be heavily pro-American in the Philippines, particularly after the United States provided extensive relief after Typhoon Haiyan while China did almost nothing, many in the Philippines intellectual elite remain dubious of the United States and of President Aquino’s hopes for an expanded rotation of American troops through the Philippines. They see the current tensions with China not as resembling the West’s resistance to Nazi aggression or containment of the former Soviet Union, but rather in terms of the United States’ more recent inability to bring stability in countries facing challenges radical Islamist groups. “Becoming a frontline state is something we must avoid at all costs – Pakistan, Afghanistan, that is not something we want to become,” said Congressman Walden Bello, a member of Mr. Aquino’s ruling coalition. The White House separately announced on Wednesday that President Obama would visit Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines in April. In the Philippines, the statement said, “He will meet with President Aquino to highlight our economic and security cooperation, including through the modernization of our defense alliance, efforts to expand economic ties and spark economic growth through the Partnership for Growth, and through our deep and enduring people-to-people ties.” Secretary of State John Kerry is making stops in South Korea, China and Indonesia during his current trip, but is not planning a stop in Manila. When he visited Asia in mid-December, he included stops in Manila and Tacloban, the city devastated last November by Typhoon Haiyan, and declared American support then for the Philippines, including $40 million in maritime security assistance.

Science   A Funeral Fraud. Advertisement The subject line of the email usually says something like “funeral notification” or perhaps “your friend’s memorial service.” It appears to come from a funeral home, maybe even a real funeral home. When you open the email, the message extends condolences and provides a link to use to learn more about “the celebration of your friend’s life,” or similar wording. It doesn’t mention a name, but the phrases themselves are enough to make you wonder: Who died? Alert from the Federal Trade Commission: This is a scam, recently hatched and circulating widely. Clicking on the link loads malicious software onto your computer, allowing the scammers to steal personal information and passwords, to gain access to accounts and to spam others on your list of contacts. Delete the email and don’t — don’t — click on the link.  Even veteran monitors of scummy attempts at fraud — some of the F.T.C.’s staff got phony funeral notices — describe this as some sort of record for stonyheartedness. “How low can you be, to prey on someone’s fear of losing a loved one?” asked Nat Wood, an assistant director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “It’s despicable.” The commission hasn’t seen evidence that the email targets seniors in particular. “The scammers approach this as an exercise in volume,” Mr. Wood said. “They send these to as many people as they can,” betting that at least some will bite. But I’m passing the warning along here, thinking that older adults could be particularly vulnerable. Who else goes to as many funerals, sadly? Losing one’s peers is one of the tougher parts of aging. And there’s some evidence that older people are more trusting and less able to spot deception, though the research recounted by my colleague Judith Graham was based on visual cues, not bogus email. So be careful and warn the older computer users you know. If they’re wondering whether someone they care about has actually died, “they’d be better off checking with the funeral home or with someone who would have knowledge of a person,” Mr. Wood advised. Those already victimized by these digital thieves will have to run antivirus programs to cleanse their computers. The F.T.C. offers advice on how to do that here.

Sports   Hanyu Wins Men’s Figure Skating Gold. Advertisement When Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan crashed to the ice on a quadruple jump, it seemed that the gold medal had slipped from his grasp. He fell again on another jump, and his hopes dimmed further. But Hanyu fought back to finish his program strong, a wise move because Patrick Chan of Canada had an even worse long program, stumbling on several jumps and shedding technical points all over the ice. So Hanyu, falls and all, ended up on top. The 19-year-old from Japan won the first men’s singles skating gold in his country’s history. Chan, a three-time world champion and the favorite coming into the Games, finished second. Dennis Ten of Kazakhstan finished third. Ten, who now trains in Los Angeles with legendary American coach Frank Carroll, captured the first figuring skating medal for Kazakhstan. Jason Brown of the United States had a chance, skating last, to grab a medal, but he faltered too and his jumps were not strong enough to make up points on the field. He finished ninth.  See all of the jumps from the men’s free skate. Kazakhstan got its first-ever medal in figure skating with Dennis Ten capturing the bronze. Carpet is being unrolled, podium being set up, lights dimming, fans evacuating for overpriced Baltikas and hot dogs on sale in the Olympic Park. Next up: women’s singles and ice dance. — MARY PILON  Yuzuru Hanzu becomes the first Japanese man to win gold, but the heartbreak continues for Canada, with Patrick Chan finishing second. Canada has never won gold in this event and Chan seemed to be their strongest hope. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Not a bad Olympic debut for American Jason Brown. He needs to get bigger jumps, especially adding the quad, to move up into the highest echelon of skating. He scored a 238.37, finishing in ninth place. And Brown looks happy with a Top 10 finish. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  And the men’s competition is now over. Japan’s Yuruzu Hanyu wins gold, Canada’s Patrick Chan silver, and Denis Ten of Kazakhstan jumped from ninth place after the short to finish with the bronze. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Jason Brown is struggling on his landings. His triple axel-triple toe combo will be reviewed on both landings for possible 2-footing. And he nearly skipped out of the landing on his triple axel. Given that Brown’s program, his first free skate at the senior level, is not at the same point start value as the top skaters, he won’t be able to make up the losses. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER With Evgeni Plushenko out, Patrick Chan’s tumbling, the stage is set for Jason Brown in that Lifetime-movie kind of way. As if, you know, being a 19-year-old kid performing on the international stage wasn’t enough, the podium is in reach for the Americans. Brown came into this Olympics an underdog, but the smell of metal is near. Not too shabby for a newbie on the senior circuit. He’s skating tonight to “Reel Around the Sun.” — MARY PILON  And now, let’s say bye-bye to Peter Liebers of Germany, too. He crashed on his opening quad toe. One more skater to go with a shot of getting on the medal stand, and that’s the American Jason Brown. He’s shooting for bronze. It’s Yuzuru Hanyu in first, Patrick Chan second, and Denis Ten in third. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Patrick Chan is going to look back and kick himself for not really taking control of this performance. He seemed just a little lacking in intensity, after opening killer quad toe. Just a bummer, because Chan has been so dominant the past three years since the Vancouver Games. The judges decided Hanyu was better. Chan scored at 178.10, total of 275.62, putting him in second place. Chan is hanging his head in the kiss-and-cry, after the scores are read, knowing this is done. The gold is gone. Yuzuru Hanyu leads by five points over Chan. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Another mistake on a jump landing for Patrick Chan. What are the judges going to deem as the better performance? Chan or Yuzuru Hanyu? — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The mistakes are adding up for Patrick Chan. He had shaky landings on his quad toe and triple axel, hanging on by putting his hands down on the ice. He’s not blowing the doors off to take the gold right now. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Yuzuru Hanyu has scored decently, moving into first, with a total 280.89. His free skate was only a 178.64, well off his season best of 193. It’s all up to Patrick Chan now. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Credit to Yuzuru Hanyu, who recovered from a bad start to get better as his free skate went. Remember, he’s only 19, skating in his first Olympics, and came in leading after an epic short program. The pressure is all on Patrick Chan of Canada, to see if he can take advantage of this and win gold. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Whoa. Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the leader going into the skate, just fell on his opening quad salchow and nearly fell again on his triple flip. He looked tight in warm-ups and now it looks like he is stressed out. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Daisuke Takahashi, the 2010 bronze medalist, struggled with his jumps. The soulfulness of performance was lovely, but two-footing jump landings is not going to cut it. He was fourth coming into the free skate. He smiled at the end of the routine, seeming satisfied with his emotional performance. He got hit hard by the judges: 164.27 for the program, 250.67 total score, that puts him in fourth place. Denis Ten still in first with four skaters to go. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Daisuke Takahashi has said he counts Evgeni Plushenko among his heroes, but like most of the field tonight, he clearly benefits from the Russian star stepping down last night. Takahashi has said he plans to retire after competing here in Sochi and he won the bronze medal in Vancouver. With this final batch, you can really smell the ravenous appetite for gold, Japanese fans screaming with his every leap. Definitely something missing here tonight with no Plushenko in the mix. Plenty of Japanese flags for Machida, Takahashi, Hanyu tho #Sochi — Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 14 Feb 14 — MARY PILON According to NBC’s Johnny Weir, Javier Fernandez has given away about 20 points from his downgrades. And the judges agree, giving him a 166.94 for the free, and a 253.92 total. Fernandez is into second, Denis Ten still leads with five skaters to go. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Javier Fernandez brought a bit of cool to being first up in the final group. He skated with a gleam in his eye, and most importantly, just looked good. The only negatives were downgraded jumps. He tossed a quad into a triple, and two triples into doubles. Lots of points lost. Maybe the pressure of going for it versus being risk-free with an Olympic medal on the line led to his downgrades. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Now that we have come to the six leaders, we’ll probably want to put our full concentration on the skating. So let’s quickly look at what to expect musically: Javier Fernandez of Spain will use the theme from “Peter Gunn,” a long forgotten TV show that spawned an unforgettable jazzy song by Henry Mancini. Daisuke Takahashi of Japan will go with a Beatles medley. We’re expecting “Yesterday,” “Come Together,” “In My Life” and “The Long and Winding Road.” The leader, Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, opts for the achingly romantic “Love Theme From Romeo and Juliet,” from that achingly romantic 1968 Franco Zeffirelli film, based on that achingly romantic Shakespeare play. Patrick Chan of Canada skates to the old favorite “The Four Seasons” by Vivaldi. Peter Liebers, of Germany, has the most audacious choice of the final group, the haunting “Who Wants to Live Forever” by Queen. And Jason Brown. “Riverdance.” Let’s watch and listen! — VICTOR MATHER Here is Javier Fernandez. He’s the first Spanish skater to grab a world championship medal and was Spain’s flag bearer at opening ceremony. His Olympic biography indicates that he belongs to Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club, Canada, where he trains. Does he curl, too? When in Canada… — MARY PILON  Denis Ten is in the lead with six skaters to go.Tatsuki Machida is second, Yan Han in third. Final group hitting ice for warm-ups now. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER You can see how bummed out Tatsuki Machida is about that free skate. He scrunched his eyes and looked so disappointed at the end. That fall at the start was so costly. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Tatsuki Machida is having a rough start, falling hard on his opening quad toe-double toe pass. Never got to the double toe. Big deductions in store. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER There are no fewer than 20 Japanese flags hanging from the stands here, surrounded by ravenous fans. And there are dozens of other flags being waved by people in their seats. This is the first venue I’ve been to in Sochi in any sport where another country gave the home-court Russians such a run for their fan cheering dominance. Daisuke Takahashi won a bronze medal in men’s singles at the 2010 Vancouver Games, but Japan has never won a gold in this event. — MARY PILON Yan Han of China was on point and skated cleanly through a huge triple axel, a quad toe, and two combinations. Good stuff all around. Yan is one to watch for the future. He’s only 17. He slides into second place behind Dennis Ten with 246.20 points. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Afro Celt Sound System, the unconventional choice of Sweden’s Alexander Majorov, is a techno-Celtic-West African band. That sounds like one too many genres, but the piece works, and is a nice contrast to the classical choices around it. He’s followed by Michal Brezina of Czech Republic, performing to the soundtrack to the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes movie. Brezina has said in interviews that his program tells the story of the film, but it’s pretty abstract. He doesn’t mime looking through a magnifying glass or taking opium — a missed opportunity? And then on to Han Yan of China, who skates to the Blue Danube Waltz. Ah, Johann Strauss, a figure skater’s best friend. — VICTOR MATHER  Michal Brezina of the Czech Republic knows that is not going to do it. He came into the free skate in 12th, and a less-than-perfect performance – complete with a fall – is not going to move him up. His 233.62 points put him in second place, for now. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER I will pose the obvious: always amazing how somebody can pull off a quad, like Michal Brezina, and botch a triple axel into a double. The quad is such a challenge, making a triple seem like a “breeze.” (I know, I know, all the jumps are hard, especially under Olympics pressure.) — JOANNE C. GERSTNER NBC’s Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski are making a good point during Alexander Majorov of Sweden’s program. A winning effort is a blend of the music, the choreography, tech content, and yes, execution. A lot wasn’t clicking for Majorov: awkward techno music, bad landings, and just never connecting. He has a 141.05 score for the free, and a 224.86 to move into fifth place. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Alexander Majorov gets points with me for that robot move he did at the opening. I, however, do not determine who gets Olympic medals. The judges do. There’s a whole row of them with delightful little screens toward the front of the arena. When they announced their names at the start, people awkwardly clapped in the arena, confused. — MARY PILON  The final group is beginning to warm up, and here is the order and their position: Javier Fernandez of Spain (third place after short, 86.98 points), Daisuke Takahashi of Japan (fourth, 86.40), Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu (first, 101.45), Patrick Chan of Canada (second, 97.52), Peter Liebus of Germany (fifth, 86.04), and the American Jason Brown (sixth, 86.00) — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  We know what you’re thinking: “Oh, Denis Ten of Kazakhstan, are you sure about your music choice? Shostakovich is too dissonant, too modern … why not try something safe like, say Victor Herbert?” But fear not. Ten isn’t trying to skate to “Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District.” His chosen piece, “The Young Lady and the Hooligan,” is a ballet, assembled from some of the more accessible Shostakovich tunes. — VICTOR MATHER And thus ends Brian Joubert’s Olympic career. This is his fourth Olympics, and this free skate was decent, with a few bobbles here and there. He won’t be challenging for the bronze, but it was more about saying goodbye on his terms. And like Jeremy Abbott, he accomplished that mission with aplomb. Joubert’s scoring was great, total of 221.95, putting him in fourth place. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER And Denis Ten vaults big-time into the lead, with 255.10 (171.04 for the long program). That’s 33 points ahead of Tomas Verner. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The number of visits Frank Carroll has paid to the kiss and cry booth with top skaters is greater than the number of scrunchies in Tonya Harding’s arsenal. — MARY PILON  Look out for airspace. The jumps will certainly be getting bigger, both in distance traveled over the ice and in height, from the final 12 skaters. Denis Ten of Kazakhstan, who now trains in California with legendary American coach Frank Carroll, is showing how the bar is going up. Ten’s jumps, which had a few landing bobbles like a hand down for balance, were noticeably bigger than the first two groups’ efforts. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Denis Ten is one to watch in this next batch. He’s Kazakhstan’s great hope for a first-ever medal in figure skating. He took silver, behind Patrick Chan, at the world championships. At that competition last year, Chan’s win over Ten was controversial enough to spark online petitions and an outcry from fans. His underdog status here could make him a hit with fans beyond his Central Asian homeland. Born in Kazakhstan’s commercial hub, Almaty, the 20-year-old Ten is part of the Korean minority of the population there and moved to Moscow in 2004 to train. Six years later, he moved to California to train under the renowned coach Frank Carroll. (Carroll is also coaching Gracie Gold in the ladies singles competition.) This season has been a difficult one for Ten. He has battled an array of injuries and withdrew from the 2013 Skate America because of an infection. — MARY PILON As we get nearer the top skaters, the choices of music will become a bit more conservative. In the next set, we’ll be hearing Shostakovich, Rodrigo, Strauss, Stravinsky and … Afro Celt Sound System featuring Robert Plant? OK, an interesting clash of styles awaits us. — VICTOR MATHER Brian Joubert of France will be the second skater up in Group Three. He was a big deal about seven years ago, when he was the world champion and cleaning up on European championships. He’s now 29, and this is probably his last Olympics. But he still has star power, according to this article, especially among women. — JOANNE C. Kevin Reynolds is the first Canadian skater, to be followed by the reigning world champion, Patrick Chan. The Canadians are very serious about their winter sports and have long been a skating powerhouse. There are a fair number of them roaming the Olympic Park in maple leaf gear, too, and taking a break from curling and hockey to attend figure skating here tonight. Yet, strangely enough, a gold medal in the men’s singles competition has eluded them. Can Reynolds or Chan break the curse? You know, no pressure. — MARY PILON Ice resurfacing time! Here’s an article that John Branch wrote about Zambonis in 2009. The Times was ON IT. — MARY PILON Group Three will be the following skaters, in order: Denis Ten of Kazakhstan, Brian Joubert of France, Alexander Majorov of Sweden, Michal Brezina of the Czech Republic, Yan Han of China and Tatsuki Machida of Japan. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER And the judges have ruled: Reynolds had some under-rotations. Score of 153.47 for free, 222.23 for total. Leader board after two groups: Tomas Verner of the Czech Republic is in first (232.99), the American Jeremy Abbott is second (232.70) and Kevin Reynolds is third (222.23). — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Oh, Kevin Reynolds of Canada. I really want to like your crazy shirt, but I can’t. Having one sleeve long and blue, and the other white and short equals visual pain. Thankfully, Reynolds’s skating was better than his shirt selection. He nailed three quads, and made them look easy. The upgrade Reynolds needs to explore is making his program elements feel real, and not time fillers between his beloved (and really good) jumps. If he gets it all together, he will be a force in the next Olympics. But now, hold the phone: the I.S.U. technical committee is reviewing two of the three quads for under-rotation. Bust out the super slo-mo! He is getting credit for only one quad. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER I have to admit, all of these guys look a little lonely in the kiss and cry after watching the clown-car version in the team event earlier this week. And I miss the German cowbell. — MARY PILON  We’re getting into a group of skaters who have a mathematical shot of winning a bronze medal, but it requires absolute perfection. No bobbles, no step-outs. Tomas Verner, in 13th place before the long program, took himself out of the improbable chase, botching the opening jumping pass. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Florent Amodio is in all-out tears as he finishes, which just makes the audience clap for him louder. In the nosebleeds are a handful of fans with French flags, waving. His total score of 198.64 is a bit to cry about. He sits in fourth place, with 13 skaters to go. — MARY PILON Remember in the 1970s when prog rock bands decided they wanted to be serious musicians and began composing LP-length symphonic works? We’re looking at you, King Crimson. Well, the trend never entirely ended. The 1990s’ alt-rock band Muse tried their hand with something called “Exogenesis: Symphony.” And the American Jeremy Abbott has chosen it for his long program. It starts out as a sweet little piano piece, then the guitars and drums join in, and … hey, it’s not too bad. A pleasant surprise. And after we watched a Ukrainian skate to “West Side Story” and an Uzbek to Little Richard, it’s nice to see Florent Amodio of France skate to the classic Parisian sounds of Edith Piaf’s “La Vie en Rose.” — VICTOR MATHER Florent Amodio opens with a sad mime face, which elicits laughs from the crowd. He, too, will try to express himself without using words. Très French. — MARY PILON And this ends well for Jeremy Abbott — 160.12 score for free, a season’s best. He moves into first with a 232.70. Abbott and his coaches, Yuko Sato and Jason Dunjen of the Detroit Skating Club, all are happy. Nice to see Abbott pleased with himself. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Crowd gives hearty applause for Abbott, who became the latest skater to do the new, apparently trendy slap-ice-with-the-hand move. He just looks relieved to be done, nods at his coach as he glides off the ice. — MARY PILON Jeremy Abbott went out on the ice, after a final word with his coaches, with a smile. And he finished his classy free skate with a smile and a fist pump. He nailed all of his jumps, taking down the quad toe that doomed him in the short to a triple in the free. But this wasn’t about scoring and being in medal contention. It was about skating for himself now, and being strong on the ice. And Abbott can walk away from Sochi with the satisfaction that he ended on a great note. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER After crashing on his opening jump, a quad, in his short program, Jeremy Abbott turned that jump into a triple for his long program. It’s self-preservation for sure. He also has no chance to win a medal, so no use injuring himself further. — LYNN ZINSER There is a real softness and grace to Jorik Hendrickx’s skating. He’s not attacking the ice, but gliding over it. Landing the triple axel was his issue in this free skate, as both attempts ended in a wonky landing. He stayed on his feet, despite being tilted in the air from the first rotation. He moves into first with a personal best of 141.42. Total score of 214.04. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Misha Ge made things lively. He dyed his hair a shade of Kool-Aid red. He really got into the music, especially at the end when Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti” kicked in. Ge had some groove going, and hello, landed all of his jumps. Too bad he can’t get extra credit from the judges for joyfully dancing while thanking the crowd. At last, somebody having fun in Sochi on the ice! He scored 135.19, for a total of 203.26 — a new personal best. He’s in first place now. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Misha Ge has definitely won the clap-o-meter thus far and even had some cheers once “Tutti Frutti” started playing. The thrust and strut as he exited the ice was a hit, too. The night is still young, and the cute little girls on skates still have many bouquets to pick up. — MARY PILON Coming up next: Misha Ge of Uzbekistan, Jorik Hendrickx of Belgium, Jeremy Abbott of the United States, Florent Amodio of France, Tomas Verner of the Czech Republic and Kevin Reynolds of Canada. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  The first set of six skaters ends with Viktor Romanenkov of Estonia. What single piece of music has been performed to by more figure skaters than any other? No one knows the answer to this mystery, but we’re willing to bet it’s “Carmen.” Romanenkov has chosen this standby and has even dressed like a bullfighter. We’re hopeful that the Czech skating later to the “Sherlock Holmes” score will come out in a deerstalker hat. — VICTOR MATHER Victor Romanenkov of Estonia broke skating’s unwritten rule and skated to “Carmen.” And no, he did not do it well enough to evoke Debi Thomas or Katarina Witt. He looked passive, fell twice, popped two jumps, downgraded triples to doubles, and appeared to give up near the end of the program. Shakiest performance so far. As expected, Romanenkov’s scores are dismal: 78.44 for free, total of 139.99. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  It is all about the details — big and small: the hand down on a jump landing, a step out, or the Humpty Dumpty save. Abdal Rakimgaliev of Kazakhstan still put together a charming program despite some miscues. He stayed on his feet, even with a near-miss spill on a triple axel landing, and seemed pretty pleased with his skate. He came into the free skate in 20th. He scores 110.22, for a total of 174.20. The mark is far from his personal and season best. The little things cost you. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Abzal Rakimgaliev of Kazakhstan, our fifth skater, is the first to turn to that popular skating staple, the movie score. The film is “Once Upon a Time in America,” a 1984 gangster film that was supposed to be another “Godfather,” but fell flat despite the talents of Sergio Leone, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and others. But while DVDs of the film are buried deep in discount bins, the flute-heavy score by Ennio Morricone is getting its day on the world stage. — VICTOR MATHER  Follow along with who’s next with the official skating order. Zoltan Kelemen of Romania had a rough skate, falling three times on jumps, and had a few wonky landings on others. He, like the earlier skaters, looked slow and lacked flow. He scrunched his eyes when he finished, as if to say, “Whew, glad that’s over.” — JOANNE C. GERSTNER It’s about as crazy of a concept as you can think of: teaching yourself all the jumps in skating, and ending up in the Olympics. Michael Christian Martinez of the Philippines, at 17, is the lone representative of his country — and yes, taught himself a lot of the jumps he just executed pretty well in the free skate. He is quite flexible and athletic, and even pulled off a Biellmann spin, the one where you pop a leg straight over the head and hold the skate. Not something men normally can — or even want — to do. He scored 119.44, for a total of 184.25. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Having the men’s short and free programs on consecutive days could be taking a toll on younger, less experienced, or not as well-conditioned skaters. Yakov Godorozha was gasping for air in the last minute of his 4-minute-30-second program, and his carving into step sequencing shallowed. Those are not good things. He scored a 118.54, for a total score of 182.19, 7 points off his season best. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The first fall came early in the first skater Alexei Bychenko’s program. It’s no secret that watching a figure skater fall at the Olympics is completely devastating. But what’s worse is hearing the crowd’s collective gasp when it happens. Something tells me NBC mutes that audio for the TV broadcast. Perhaps that’s for the best. It’s unclear where the large snow leopard and bunny rabbit that were in the stands, perhaps strays from a Flaming Lips concert, have wandered. — MARY PILON That orange, in person, is construction cone orange. Electric tangerine. Neon Tang. Blinding. But the crowd seems into it. — MARY PILON Alexei Bychenko has gotten the free skate started. He came in 22nd after the short program, and turned in a passable long program. He had a step-out on a triple axel and a fall on another jump. His program noticeably slowed as he tired. Bychenko has quite a geographical scope. He is from Ukraine, is skating for Israel and lives in New Jersey. He has a score of 177.06. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Much of the music tonight will be familiar to the typical listener, if only by causing the “I know that from somewhere” feeling. You’re probably not having that feeling with the first skater, Alexei Bychenko, of Israel. He’s performing to “Nostradamus” by Maksim Mrvica. I’ll save you the trip to Wikipedia. He is a pianist who performs “classical crossover music.” To these ears he sounds like he’s crossing over between Carl Orff and Liberace. — VICTOR MATHER Figure skating, like most events here, has had a mostly Russian crowd. And strangely, there are a LOT of empty seats still, even as a marquee event kicks off. Perhaps that’s a Plushenko-related dropoff? But judging from the dozens of banners hanging in the arena, there’s a serious showing from Japan, which will no doubt give Yuzuru Hanyu some momentum as he takes to the ice later. — MARY PILON Prepare to shield your eyes: Yakov Godorozha of Ukraine, the second skater of the first group, is wearing a frightening combo. He has a traffic-cone orange shirt, with spandex-like pants that are supposed to look like jeans and sequin-studded “pockets.” Yeah. Not good. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER In this first group of skaters is a bit of Filipino Olympic history. Michael Christian Martinez is the first Olympic figure skater from the Philippines and the first Winter Olympian for the country since it sent an Alpine skier to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. Since the formation of its Olympic committee in 1911, the country has never won an Olympic gold medal. He will be skating to “Malagueña” by Ernesto Lecuona. — MARY PILON The Glimmer twins — Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir — as NBC’s Terry Gannon called them — are now on the air. And Weir is fashion fabulous as he has been all Olympics, wearing a glittertastic outfit worthy of a Tim Gunn swoon: silver sequined jacket, chunky gold chain. Lipinski went all Valentine’s Day in a red jacket and a pink blouse with red hearts. Let the skating begin! — JOANNE C. GERSTNER In addition to all the talk of axels and lutzes, we’ll be giving you then lowdown on the music the skaters have chosen. Gone are the days of Dick Button, when skating music seldom roamed beyond Tchaikovsky and Johann Strauss. Of the 24 skaters tonight, only seven have chosen classical music, and that includes lighter fare like Gershwin. By our count, six will perform to movie scores, and the other 11 to a wide variety of genres, including standards, dance music, pop, Broadway, and, well, “Riverdance.” The only thing you won’t hear is vocals, which are strictly forbidden. Let us know in the comments whether you prefer your skating to “Carmen” or Carmen Miranda. — VICTOR MATHER The men’s free skate will have layers of drama, especially on the American side. This is most likely the last skate on Olympic ice for the four-time United States champion Jeremy Abbott. He’s 28, and he will leave these Olympics again wondering why he could not perform better under pressure. His recovery from a bad fall off his opening quad in the short program was admirable, but the damage was done. On the other side, Jason Brown, 19, is just starting a potential run of multiple Olympics. Getting to the Olympics, and being in medal contention, is certainly more than even he could have hoped for when he started his first season at the senior level last fall. Brown is like a hot rookie pitcher, just up from Class AAA, who is now starting Game 7 of the World Series. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER You can relive Evgeny Plushenko’s very bad day, via Jere Longman’s article on the men’s short program. If you are handicapping the men’s long program — and if you aren’t, go ahead and give it a try — we have a handy interactive that shows the jump history of the top six contenders. And if you think this gold medal might be won without a quad jump, as it was in 2010 by Evan Lysacek, think again. Advertisement Go to Home Page »

Travel   In the West, It’s Not Just About the Snow. Advertisement Recent storms have dumped loads of fresh snow in the Western United States, welcome news for the region’s national parks and resorts, many of which have been adding history, wildlife and ecology tours to their usual winter menus. In Colorado, the Rocky Mountain Nature Association has added a “Wintertime Wonders” bus tour to its many educational programs. Passengers will learn about the history and ecology of Rocky Mountain National Park from a cozy seat aboard a heated bus while sipping free hot beverages, as opposed to venturing out on snowshoes or skis, as their usual excursions require. The flexible nature of the tours allows guides to “throw in a little of everything,” Rachel Balduzzi, the association’s field seminar director, said, including the history of the park’s formation and how the animals are adapting to the winter environment. ($200 for up to four adults; $50 for each additional adult; and $25 for children 12 and younger: rmna.org.) Spring Creek Ranch, a resort in Jackson Hole, Wyo., has taken a more upscale approach to its winter safaris this season, packaging two nights at the resort with a snow coach tour through Yellowstone National Park, where passengers will spend a night at Old Faithful Snow Lodge. Stephen Price, the resort’s owner, said in an email that a benefit is that there are virtually no other visitors in the park, making for a more intimate experience. ($1,450 per person for double occupancy; $1,988 for single; springcreekranch.com). Single-day “Wildlife Escapes” are also available through Spring Creek. They include a snow coach safari, a sleigh ride through the National Elk Refuge and admission to the National Museum of Wildlife Art. ($195; $175 for children 12 and younger.) In Montana, the Yellowstone Association Institute has been hosting a variety of both private and public tours and seminars for many winters, the most exciting of which might be snowshoeing the north range of the park in search of wolves to observe. While the institute’s Wolf Week in March offers even more opportunities to learn about these animals, a new “Wildlife Weekend Escape,” offered on specific dates throughout the season, teaches visitors how to listen for and observe all types of animals, and includes several viewing excursions into Lamar Valley, where bull elk, bald eagles, bighorn sheep, bison and coyotes are also known to roam.

Business   Passing Grades. Advertisement By Yaakov Ben-David Feb 16, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — It’s always a relief when you find out the teacher is grading on a curve, and that’s precisely what Yaakov BenDavid has for us today. You wouldn’t want to get all the way to the end of your solving week just to find out that you had failed. Our F’s have been changed to D’s, thank goodness, and the result is familiar phrases changed and then clued punnily. Of the theme phrases, my favorites were TWO DIVES FOR A TEN, DISH AND CHIPS, and DAIRY GODMOTHER, although I was a little less comfortable with the Stephen Hawking reference in SCIENCE DICTION. Outside of the theme, there’s a good amount of fresh and crunchy stuff in Mr. BenDavid’s grid, like JOB SEARCH, LOOSE TEA, LOVE NEST, BED OF ROSES, MUSCLE CELL and BLONDE ALE, which I got from the crossings, having never heard of Duvel (I’m not a beer drinker.) I could have lived without JILTERS and I still think that NERFS is not really something that can be pluralized (isn’t it really NERF balls?), but other than that, a nice Sunday outing. Let’s catch up with Mr. BenDavid: Once again, I’m thrilled to be published in The New York Times, my fifth puzzle. In my previous puzzles — all Sundays — I never had as few as six theme answers, as in today’s offering. Having only six meant I could spread them out more, and I had much more fun/leeway filling in the nontheme answers. I love choosing interesting or rarely seen long nontheme answers and then filling in the shorter answers around them. Among the 17 nontheme answers of eight letters or more, we have BED OF ROSES, AGITATING, COMO ESTA and LOVE NEST. DAIRY GODMOTHER was the seed; my original clue — which made my family laugh — was “She might make you a cheesecake you can’t refuse.” The clue was changed by Will, keeping it one hop away from the original phrase instead of two. My first idea for a clue for SCIENCE DICTION was “Exceptional quality of Sir Patrick Stewart’s Captain Picard,” but you might have had to be a Trekkie to get it; I think Will’s Stephen Hawking clue works quite well. The first few versions of the puzzle — there were over 20 — had a seventh theme answer stretching across the middle row, but I found that it made everything too crowded and led to very weak fill (and something like 24 three-letter words). It was clued “Lament of the Best-in-Show runners-up at Westminster” with the answer: WE HAVEN’T THE DOGGIEST. Pity I couldn’t fit it in since coincidentally the puzzle appears the same week as the dog show. Thanks to Wordplay, it has seen the light of day.

Foreign   Obama Promises New Aid to Jordan in Refugee Crisis. Advertisement Advertisement By SARAH WHEATON and MARK LANDLERFEB. 14, 2014 RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — President Obama announced during a meeting here Friday night with King Abdullah II of Jordan that he would seek to renew a five-year aid package to help Jordan bear the burden of the more than 600,000 Syrian refugees who have fled the civil war there. Mr. Obama, amid broader discussions with King Abdullah about the stalemate in Syria, also announced that the United States would guarantee $1 billion in loans to help keep Jordan’s wavering economy afloat.  The president briefly outlined that aid package as he spoke to reporters at Sunnylands, the Southern California estate where Mr. Obama met with the king for 2 hours and 15 minutes over what the White House called a working dinner. Calling the Jordanians “very generous,” Mr. Obama said, “It’s very important for us to make sure that we’re supportive of the kingdom in accommodating all these refugees.” Mr. Obama’s discussions with the Jordanian king are part of an intensive diplomatic outreach to the Middle East over the next month, as the United States conducts risky negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, gropes for a political solution to the fighting in Syria, and tries to nudge the Israelis and the Palestinians toward a peace agreement. Advertisement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will make a trip the White House on March 3, and Mr. Obama is scheduled to meet with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and, possibly, other Persian Gulf leaders during a visit there. In their talks Friday, the president and Jordan’s King Abdullah discussed a vast range of regional issues, including the Middle East peace process, administration officials said. But the dominant issue was Syria, whose civil war has placed heavy burdens on its neighbor. Syrians are only the latest group to seek the relative stability provided by Jordan, which has also taken in large numbers of people fleeing fighting in Iraq and Sudan in recent years. The United States aid package, which expires in September, has been valued at $660 million a year.   President Barack Obama meets with King Abdullah II to pledge $1 billion in loan guarantees for Jordan and to consider new ways to pressure the regime of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Jordan’s economic problems have been made worse by militants’ attacks on a natural gas pipeline from Egypt, which has been in upheaval since the Arab Spring uprising in 2011. It is not the first time that Mr. Obama has used Sunnylands — a 200-acre estate built by Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and ambassador who died in 2002 — as a diplomatic backdrop. Last year, he hosted President Xi Jinping of China at Sunnylands for a two-day meeting that was noted for its unusual informality and was interpreted as a milestone in their nations’ often tense and generally stilted four-decade diplomatic history. Sunnylands is “conducive to a conversation” between Mr. Obama and King Abdullah, “given all the issues they face and given their warm relationship,” said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. Mr. Obama will be staying at the estate through Sunday — the canary-yellow master bedroom is equipped with speakers that pipe in the songs of the birds outdoors. Advertisement The president arrived at the Palm Springs International Airport about 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time on a day when the temperature hovered around 90 degrees. Hours earlier, Mr. Obama delivered remarks in Fresno, Calif., more than 300 miles to the north, about the federal response to California’s severe drought. The water shortage has placed extra scrutiny on usage here in the Coachella Valley, where intensive irrigation has transformed the desert scrubland into lush lawns and golf courses. Palm Springs residents use 736 gallons of water per day, among the highest usage rate in the state, according to a state database. The president has no public events scheduled beyond the meeting with King Abdullah, and he is expected to spend much of the time golfing. (He does not have to go far for a quick fix: Sunnylands has a nine-hole course.) King Abdullah arrived here on Thursday, and visited with Gov. Jerry Brown of California ahead of Mr. Obama’s arrival. “Meeting with the King of Jordan to discuss drought, the efficient use of water and renewable energy,” Mr. Brown said in a tweet that included a photo of the two on a sunny path, in unnecessary blazers. Sarah Wheaton reported from Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Mark Landler from Washington. A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2014, on page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Syria Is Expected to Be Main Topic as Obama Meets With King of Jordan.

Home   From Hugo França, Nature Sculpted. Advertisement Advertisement By STEPHEN MILIOTIFEB. 14, 2014 The Brazilian designer Hugo França reclaims felled wood from the rainforest to create sculptural furniture. Hugo França was working as an industrial engineer for a computer company in São Paulo, in his native Brazil, when in 1981, at the age of 26, he moved to Trancoso, in the northeastern coastal area of Bahia, to live among the indigenous Pataxó people. The move was prompted by a love of nature, but it eventually led him to a new career as a wood sculptor. Today Mr. França is lauded for his furniture made of burned pequi wood left over from deforestation. Though the practice is now outlawed, large areas of rain forest were cleared in the 1960s and ’70s for agriculture and cattle grazing. Using techniques he learned from the Pataxó, Mr. França grants these scarred materials new life on a scale as grand as the pequi itself (the trees routinely reach 150 feet in height and 10 feet in diameter). The pieces are exhibited worldwide, most recently at the R & Company gallery in New York, which showed Mr. França’s chaise longue made from a Pataxó canoe. A group of his sculptural pieces is on view through May at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Fla. Go to Home Page »
Sports   Oshie Lifts U.S. Over Russia in Hockey Shootout. Advertisement The United States defeated Russia, 3-2, in a shootout in men’s hockey at the Sochi Olympics. The most anticipated hockey game of the Olympics so far was as close as expected. Pavel Datsyuk scored twice for Russia, once to give the host country a 1-0 lead and then to tie the score in the third period. Russia appeared to score the go-ahead goal late in the third period, but it was waved off because the net was slightly off its moorings. After a five-minute overtime failed to produce a winner, the game went to a shootout, where it became the T.J. Oshie Show. He took six of the Americans’ eight shots, scoring on four of them, and the United States capitalized on great stops by Jonathan Quick for the win. As we mentioned earlier, the ramifications of this game to the tournament may be minimal. The U.S. earned 2 points, and Russia 1, in the standings. The Americans lead Group A with 5 points. Russia has 4. Both teams play Sunday as group play wraps up. If the U.S. beats Slovenia, it will receive a bye into the quarterfinals. If Russia defeats Slovakia in regulation, it will have 7 points, which would be enough to also earn a bye if the Canada-Finland game Sunday ends in regulation. Why was T.J. Oshie shooting so many times? Because he is among the best in the N.H.L. in the shootout. He has scored on 7 of his 10 shootout attempts this season. T.J. Oshie: “I was glad it ended when it did. I was running out of moves.” — Chris Johnston (@reporterchris) 15 Feb 14 At the beginning of these Games, The Times’ Jere Longman wrote about Warroad, Minn., where T.J. Oshie went to high school. It is known as Hockeytown USA because it has produced eight Olympic hockey players. The first seven have won medals. Oshie is the eighth. Taking his sixth shot of the shootout, Oshie converts again to give the U.S. a 3-2 win. On the seventh shot of the shootout, a sprawling Quick stops Kovalchuk. Oshie tries to go backhand this time and misses. We are still tied, 2-2. Datsyuk tries to go five-hole on Quick and fails. The T.J. Oshie Show continues. He hits it off the crossbar and in. Kovalchuk absolutely freezes Quick to put Russia up again. Oshie, given another chance, scores to tie it up. Datsyuk gives Russia the lead Oshie, naturally, shoots again for the U.S. Tries to lull Bobrovsky to sleep, but Oshie misses the net. Order switches after three rounds. Kovalchuk doesn’t get it this time. Kovalchuk keeps it simple and scores for Russia to tie it, 1-1. Pavelski makes a lot of moves, but can’t get it past Bobrovsky. Brilliant glove save by Quick on a Datsyuk backhand. U.S. still up, 1-0, after two rounds. Van Riemsdyk is stopped by Bobrovsky. Quick got a piece of Malkin’s shot. U.S. up, 1-0, after first round. T.J. Oshie, a shootout specialist, goes first for the U.S. and scores. The teams will alternate shooters for three rounds. If they are still tied, the teams can re-use shooters. We are headed to a shootout to decide this. Both teams have earned 1 point. The winner will get another one. Patrick Kane is a two-time Stanley Cup winner and perhaps the best American forward in the N.H.L., but he is a bit snakebitten in the Olympics. He had another great chance with 28 seconds left in overtime, just after Quick made another brilliant save on Alex Ovechkin. Patrick Kane was stopped by Bobrovsky on a breakaway that seemed as if it was going to end the game with just under 3 minutes remaining. The U.S. got too neat on its remaining power play, and Datsyuk nearly scored shorthanded before the power play expired. U.S. is on the power play, which means it will be 4-on-3 to begin the five-minute sudden-death overtime. If we are still tied after five minutes, we will go to a shootout. Ryan Kesler, who may have a broken finger from blocking a shot, has been dominating face-offs, particularly in the U.S. offensive zone. It helped the U.S get a few scoring chances on the power play, but the Americans could not convert as the period ended. The U.S still has about 30 seconds of power play in overtime. Yevgeny Medvedev takes an interference penalty to give the American a power play with 1:32 left in the third. The U.S. takes a timeout to set things up. The Americans’ two goals have come on the power play. According to NBCSN, the goal did not count because the net was not in place. And we’re talking inches here. That is a difference in the rules between Olympic hockey and N.H.L. hockey. Am hearing that the Russians have asked for video review of the Miracle on Ice — Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 15 Feb 14 Seconds after Datsyuk nearly completed a hat trick and Kovalchuk had a great chance, Tyutin appeared to break the tie with 4:40 left in the game. It was waved off after a video review for no clear reason. High stick? Did it not actually go in the net? Net loose as Tyutin blasts it past Quick. Weird play, Quick barely moved for it. Goal waved off. USA got *very* lucky. #Sochi2014 — Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) 15 Feb 14 On the power play, Pavel Datsyuk scores his second goal, from the left face-off circle, with 7:16 left in the game. Alexander Radulov — yes, him again — was screening Quick on the play. With Russia charging, Dustin Brown takes a kneeing penalty 12:26 into the third. Joe Pavelski scores off a great cross-ice pass from Patrick Kane to give the U.S. the lead with 10:29 left in the third. Oh, look, Alexander Radulov is in the penalty box again. He is called for hooking with 11:33 left in the game. This worked out very well for the U.S. the last time. Good to know that Russians are just as cheesy as Americans when it comes to what’s on the JumboTron. The Kiss Cam is going strong. Smooch! — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 15 Feb 14 Russia was methodical on this power play, and the results were better. Still they did not score. Datsyuk somehow missed the net on a close-range shot, with the far side of the goal wide open. Malkin had several great chances, but Quick had a brilliant glove save on one. Dustin Brown is called for interference 3:14 into the third. He is not happy about the call. Might have been a dive. Rather than scoring, Alex Ovechkin may just be trying to eliminate the competition. Ryan McDonagh and Ryan Kesler were shaken up by Ovi shots on the power play in the second period, and McDonagh got nailed again by Ovechkin on the power play to start the third. But it was a good kill for the U.S., allowing no shots. The American goal scorer Cam Fowler is the youngest player on the ice for the United States at 22. He is also, gasp, Canadian. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, to a Canadian father and American mother, and moved to Michigan as a toddler. He was a first-round draft pick by Anaheim in 2010, selected 12th over all. Fowler has been blogging from Sochi for the Los Angeles Times. Russia was in control of the game, taking a 1-0 lead on a Pavel Datsyuk goal 9:15 into the second. It was a typical Datsyuk goal, with him skating beautifully through American defenders. But Alexander Radulov took a dumb cross-checking penalty with about five minutes left in the period. He knocked over Dustin Brown far away from the play. The U.S., which hadn’t generated much offense in the period up to that point, capitalized. James van Riemsdyk of Middletown, N.J., was a spark, but Cam Fowler, a 22-year-old defenseman for the Anaheim Ducks, got the goal, which went in off his skate. The U.S. faces a dangerous beginning to the third period, with Russia on the power play. Alex Ovechkin has been brilliant on Russia’s first two power plays, but does not yet have a goal. He’s been too good to be kept scoreless for long. Patrick Kane was called for hooking with less than a second left in the second period. Russia will start the third period on the power play, putting the U.S. in a tight spot. Cam Fowler, the American goal scorer, feel down in the middle of the ice and turned the puck over, which sent Evgeni Malkin streaking toward the U.S. net. But Fowler was bailed out by Kevin Shattenkirk and T.J. Oshie. Fowler’s goal went in off his skate, so it had to be reviewed to see if there was a distinct kicking motion, which is not allowed. There was not, so the goal stands. James van Riemsdyk, the Maple Leafs forward, has been the best player on offense for the U.S. He had two brilliant chances in the power play, and then a great pass to set up a goal by Cam Fowler with 3:46 left in the second. Alexander Radulov takes a run at Dustin Brown away from the play and gets called for it. Karen Crouse notes that the first assist on Datsyuk’s goal was credited to Andrei Markov. Datsyuk and Markov are the only two players in the game who were alive in February 1980, when that thing happened that everyone keeps talking about. With the U.S. down 1-0 to Russia in this preliminary round hockey game, kind of feels like we are losing the Cold War, doesn’t it? — Justin Sablich (@JSablichNYT) 15 Feb 14 If you thought the ice was big before, four-on-four hockey made it look like a frozen Great Lake. There were few chances for either team. Off-setting penalties for cross checking on Backes and Tyutin. Ryan Kesler is back in the game for the U.S. Seconds after James Van Riemsdyk has the best American chance in a while, Pavel Datsyuk gets into open ice and weaves through three American defensemen to beat Quick, rattling the puck off the post and giving Russia the lead. I believe that every Russian flag made in the past 20 years is here at US-Russia hockey game in #Sochi. Russia just scored to make it, 1-0. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 15 Feb 14 Ryan Kesler had to go to the locker room with the trainer after taking a hard shot to his left hand during the penalty kill. That would be a tough loss for the U.S. Ovechkin played all two minutes of Russia’s first power play and played all of the second one, too. He was electric, with three great chances, hitting the post at least once. Ryan McDonagh and Ryan Kesler each took hard shots to their bodies during the penalty kill, McDonagh in the back and Kesler in the hand. #Russia comes up empty during two-minute power play. Crowd in #Sochi fired up, now doing the wave. — David M. Herszenhorn (@herszenhorn) 15 Feb 14 After a brilliant chance by Paul Stastny, Max Pacioretty took a penalty to put Russia on the power play again. Slovenia beat Slovakia, 3-1, earlier today, the first ever win at the Olympics for the Slovenes. Russia’s 5-2 victory over Slovenia on Thrusday, which was close until the third period, caused quite a bit of hand-wringing among the Russian news media. But maybe that game said more about Slovenia than Russia. It’s possible that the Americans’ 7-1 victory over Slovakia also said more about the Slovakians than the Americans. The U.S. fails to score on the remaining power play that started the second period. Since 1980, the United States is 1-2-1 vs Russia in the Olympics. Meetings have been frequent lately. This is the fourth time in four Olympics the teams have played. Russia beat the U.S., 5-4, in group play in Turin in 2006. In the 2002 Salt Lake Games, the teams tied, 2-2, in group play, then the U.S. won, 3-2, in the semifinals. Genius marketing scheme by FX: the U.S. broadcast on NBCSN is littered with commercials for the new season of “The Americans,” a show about Russian spies posing as an American suburban family in the 1980s. Just a refresher: Olympic hockey and N.H.L. hockey have slightly different rules. Jeff Z. Klein and Stu Hackel broke them down here. Even in the Olympics I still think it’s dumb that home teams in hockey wear dark colors. — Sam Borden (@SamBorden) 15 Feb 14 It has been a very physical game so far, resembling an N.H.L. game at times. There are 41 N.H.L. players in this game. Fourteen American players have an N.H.L. teammate on the Russian squad. Max Pacioretty was even involved in a scrum with Montreal Canadiens teammate Alexei Emelin. American goalie Jonathan Quick has been tested a lot and has been excellent. At the end of first period, the game is scoreless. Russia outshot the U.S., 13-10, but the Americans closed that gap in the final minute with a power play. The U.S. will continue on that power play for the first 1:23 of the second period. After a sizzling start by both teams, the U.S. has not been able to sustain much offensive pressure as the first period goes on. But the Americans are going on the power play in the final seconds of the period as Ilya Nikulin goes off for holding. Russia has tilted the ice in its favor in the latter part of the first period. The Russians thought they had a goal on a great play by Alexander Semin, but Quick held firm. Very strong penalty kill for the United States against a Russian power play. Russia got off two shots. Blake Wheeler is going to the penalty box for tripping. Russia goes on the power play. Very lively early on, with hard checks and blistering pace on offense. The best American chance came from Ryan Callahan. Pavel Datsyuk was stopped in close by Jonathan Quick. Russia has five shots, U.S. four. Was minimal checking during #Russia – #Slovenia hockey match on Thursday. Today, #Russia – #USA are slamming each other at every chance — David M. Herszenhorn (@herszenhorn) 15 Feb 14 Rangers fans will not be surprised to see Ryan Callahan, their captain, mixing it up around the net after his shot was stopped. David Backes of the Blues, also known for physical play, joined in the fun. A “gathering of the clans” as Pierre McGuire called it. Russia scored two goals in the first four minutes against Slovenia. No goals through four minutes in today, though there were several good chances. Significant fact: the U.S. is the designated home team for this game, which seems ridiculous. But it’s not merely symbolic. It means the U.S. has the last line change, so American Coach Dan Bylsma can create the matchups he want on the ice. He shuffled defensive pairings in practice Friday. Paul Martin and Brooks Orpik, who play for Bylsma in Pittsburgh, are expected to be one unit, matched up against the top Russian line of Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin and Alexander Semin. Ryan Suter and Ryan McDonagh will be another pair, expected to be on the ice against the line of Ilya Kovalchuk, Pavel Datsyuk and Alexander Radulov. NBCSN just finished up an Al Michaels interview on the Miracle on Ice, as I predicted. I will try to limit my mentions of the Miracle on Ice, but just so you know, there are three connections to that game in this game. American defenseman Ryan Suter’s father, Bob, played in the game. Russia Coach Zinetula Bilyaletdinov also played in the game. Russian forward Viktor Tikhonov’s grandfather was the coach for the Soviet Union. Karen Crouse reports from the Bolshoy Ice Dome that the U.S. did not come out for warmups until the fifth minute of the warmup session. In stands above the goal where U.S. was shooting two women were stoically holding a large Russian flag with an angry bear and the words “The Red Machine is Back.” Significant fact: the U.S. is the designated home team for this game, which seems ridiculous. But it’s not merely symbolic. It means the U.S. has the last line change, so American Coach Dan Bylsma can create the matchups he wants on the ice by changing lines whenever Russia does. Because of that, Bylsma shuffled defensive pairings in practice Friday. Paul Martin and Brooks Orpik, who play for Bylsma in Pittsburgh, are expected to be one unit, matched up against the top Russian line of Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin and Alexander Semin. Ryan Suter and Ryan McDonagh will be another pair, expected to be on the ice against the line of Ilya Kovalchuk, Pavel Datsyuk and Alexander Radulov. USA vs Russia about 15 minutes away. With so many NHL players, I can’t wait to see all the fights. — John Branch (@JohnBranchNYT) 15 Feb 14 What does the game mean? Well, everything and nothing. It’s a game that the teams and their fans very much want to win, and it is no doubt the most high profile game of the preliminary round. But it’s still only a preliminary round game. Its significance is in the standings, not the medal table just yet. You only need to look to the 2010 Olympics. The United States beat Canada in group play, helping send the Canadians on a more difficult path through the elimination rounds. The United States and Canada ended up meeting again in the final, with the Canadians winning. The winner of Saturday’s game is likely to earn an automatic berth to the quarterfinals. The top four teams in group play advance to the quarterfinals. Sweden, undefeated in a weak group C, would secure the first spot with a win over Latvia on Saturday. The other eight teams enter a playoff for the final four quarterfinal spots. There is a possibility that even the loser of the U.S.-Russia game could earn a quarterfinal berth and avoid the playoff round. Advertisement Go to Home Page »

MONDAY’S PUZZLE — This is only David Gray’s second time out in The New York Times, and here he is, telling us what to SAY. Should we repeat after him? Why not? He’s hinting that the word SAY can go before the starts of the theme entries in his puzzle to make other familiar phrases, and they’re all pretty good: SAY UNCLE, SAY NO MORE, SAY CHEESE and SAY WHAT. There seemed to be a plethora of three-letter words, but the solve was smooth, so I really have no complaints.

Foreign   Bollywood Superstar’s Movie Gets Tangled in Electoral Politics. Advertisement   But for the Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, the way his most recent film, “Jai Ho,” earned 1 billion rupees, or $16 million, is seen by his critics as a failure — proof, they say, that he has alienated Muslims, who make up a large part of his fan base, with his recent appearances with Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Born to a Muslim father and a Hindu mother, Mr. Khan, 48, routinely draws 1 billion rupees with his films in the opening weekend alone. But “Jai Ho,” an action film about a former Indian Army major who turns into the common man’s hero, took 15 days to reach the 1-billion-rupee mark after opening on Jan. 24, an unusually slow start for a Salman Khan movie. “Salman, your movie is flop because you are with Modi,” wrote one Facebook user on Mr. Khan’s official fan page, echoing many commenters who were upset at the actor’s association with Mr. Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat and a candidate for prime minister. Mr. Modi has come under intense criticism for his handling of the religious riots in his state in 2002, which left more than 1,000 dead, most of them Muslims. Mr. Modi has long denied any wrongdoing, and in December, an Indian court rejected a petition seeking to prosecute him over his role in the riots, saying there wasn’t enough evidence. Mr. Khan has been a longtime supporter of the Congress party, which leads the governing coalition in New Delhi. But on Jan. 14, he dined with Mr. Modi in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, and was photographed next to the chief minister at the state’s annual kite flying festival. After Mr. Khan’s visit to Gujarat, the state waived the entertainment tax on tickets to “Jai Ho.” In Gujarat, he described Mr. Modi as a “good man” in televised comments and followed up with a television interview in which he said that there was no need for Mr. Modi to apologize for the Gujarat riots because an investigative team appointed by the Supreme Court had cleared him of wrongdoing. The response from Muslims was immediate. Asaduddin Owaisi, the leader of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a Muslim political party based in Hyderabad, called for a boycott of “Jai Ho.” Amjad Ali, 23, a regular commentator on the Salman Khan fan page on Facebook who is from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, told India Ink that he wouldn’t be watching the movie. “Salman bhai was everything for me,” said Mr. Ali, a tea shop owner, using the Hindi word for brother. “He was my idol, until he justified what Modi did.” Another commenter, Omar Ahmed of Hyderabad, 25, who said he had grown up watching Mr. Khan’s movies, expressed disappointment with his idol, although he did go to see “Jai Ho.” “I am not saying I will give up watching his films, but he will certainly not remain my hero and the reason I would have flocked to his films,” he said. Mr. Khan’s representatives, his brothers Sohail Khan, the director of “Jai Ho,” and Arbaaz Khan, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The national spokeswoman for the Bharatiya Janata Party, Meenakshi Lekhi, also declined to comment. Nandini Ramnath, the film editor of Mint, a business newspaper, said “Jai Ho,” which was universally panned by critics, would have struggled to match the lofty box-office takes of Mr. Khan’s previous films, even without the controversy. “Modi or no Modi, ‘Jai Ho’ didn’t work wonders because of its subpar writing, lackluster direction, the absence of a credible romantic subplot between the leads and predictability in the extreme,” she said in an email. “The Modi factor might have helped the filmmakers save face, but the fact is that ‘Jai Ho’ wasn’t as entertaining, in the popular sense, as Khan’s previous films. It wasn’t up to the mark, which potential audiences seemed to realize after the opening weekend craze had died down.” However, Mr. Khan’s previous films have also opened to bad reviews, like “Dabangg 2,” and have gone on to become a success, thanks to his sheer star power. Shohini Ghosh, a film studies professor at Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi who is writing a book about Mr. Khan’s influence, said the actor first became a star in the 1990s. Back then, religious tensions were high after militant Hindus destroyed Babri Masjid, a 16th-century mosque, in 1992. Muslim viewers in India, feeling marginalized by the Hindu majority, glommed onto the Muslim actor who played the role of the hero. Now, she said, Mr. Khan’s Muslim fans see his recent remarks about Mr. Modi as a refusal to acknowledge the magnitude of what happened in Gujarat in 2002. “For this reason, many have refused to see ‘Jai Ho,’ ” she said. Dr. Ghosh said many fans were also upset that Mr. Khan took part in the government-organized festival at Saifai, the ancestral village of Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister, Akhilesh Yadav, last month, because Mr. Yadav has been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence between Hindus and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar in September. Thousands of Muslims who fled their villages are still in camps. As in Gujarat, “Jai Ho” received an exemption on the entertainment tax in Uttar Pradesh after Mr. Khan’s appearance. “His comments on NDTV comparing the tragic events of Muzaffarnagar to everyday death in the city show how far away from his fans he is,” she said. But even if the box-office figures for “Jai Ho” are lackluster for a Salman Khan film, it’s still too early to say that the actor’s fortunes have turned. The movie, which has earned 1.1 billion rupees in India as of Thursday, is still likely to turn a profit, no small feat in Bollywood, where relatively few movies actually make money. Also, his sway over the film industry stands firm, as demonstrated by all the Bollywood producers who declined to speak on the record about Mr. Khan, with one saying that he feared antagonizing the star.

Travel   36 Hours in Baton Rouge, La.. Advertisement Advertisement 36 Hours By BRENDAN SPIEGEL FEB. 14, 2014 Louisiana’s capital has neither the nonstop party scene nor the obvious cultural charm of its more celebrated neighbor to the southeast, yet this laid-back Mississippi River town offers a unique appeal. The French, Spanish, Creole and Cajun influences of its three-century history blend with the youthful spirit of Louisiana State University’s nearly 30,000 students, stewing up a Southern mélange that’s on full display during Baton Rouge’s own Mardi Gras celebrations, through March 1, as well as events like the Baton Rouge Blues Festival (April 12). Along rural roads and in revitalized downtown neighborhoods, inside strip malls and by industrial sites, this unheralded city reveals a dynamic musical heritage and rich culinary history that demand to be discovered. FRIDAY 1. Blues Clues | 4 p.m. Hidden along a down-on-its-heels stretch just north of downtown, Buddy Stewart Memorial Music Foundation & Rhythm Museum provides a decidedly lowbrow look at the city’s musical history. The sparse, cafeteria-like room is lined with makeshift exhibitions about the band leader Buddy Stewart and local legends like Lazy Lester and Raful Neal. But the real gem is the vintage record collection housed two doors down, separated by a barbershop and behind a sign that reads “Tax Services” — also apparently available here; the shop is overflowing with 45s and 12-inch records from Louisiana bluesmen. 2. High Art | 6 p.m. Transition to a much tonier cultural scene at the 125,000-square-foot Shaw Center for the Arts, the showpiece of a revitalized downtown. The center covers a full city block, encompassing the Manship Theater, where everyone from Branford Marsalis to high school jazz bands have gigs coming up; the LSU Museum of Art, where an exhibition opening March 8 will look at how jazz and the blues influenced Harlem Renaissance artists; and several smaller theaters, galleries and restaurants. During happy hour, Tsunami, a sushi restaurant with a sixth-floor terrace, is popular for sake cocktails ($6) and preshow sunsets. 3. Down to Business | 9 p.m. Restaurant IPO caters to the downtown business crowd, but the atmosphere is more West Village than Wall Street, with exposed brick, unfinished industrial walls and cypress wood furniture. The “Southern tapas” menu offers savory items like deviled eggs mixed with crayfish and tasso — a peppery smoked pork regional specialty — and topped by crispy, batter-fried oysters. Larger plates like pan-roasted Gulf fish are also successful; dinner for two runs $100. SATURDAY 4. Pancakes and Pork | 9 a.m. A popular food truck turned brick-and-mortar spot, GoYaYa’s Crepes operates from a stand at the Main Street Market, a collection of local food businesses organized inside a downtown parking garage. Thin, crispy pancakes are stuffed with inventive options like Vietnamese-style shredded pork with bean sprouts ($7.50), plus seasonal specials such as pulled pork and peaches, matching what’s ripe at the year-round Saturday morning Red Stick Farmers Market (redstickfarmersmarket.org), held just outside the building. Advertisement 5. Artisan Central | 11 a.m. A scrap metal dragon and giant mermaid guard the exterior of Circa 1857, an art, antiques and architectural salvage store surrounded by many dozens of pieces from a self-taught welding artist named Joseph Jilbert. Take home something smaller, like a Master Lock tree frog ($100), then explore the rest of the artsy multistore compound. Shop for upscale crafts items like a driftwood bird’s nest chandelier ($1,025) at Mosaic Garden (mosaicgarden.biz); listen to banjo music over sweet tea at Yvette Marie’s Cafe (bonannos.com); and browse reworked vintage jewelry and dish towel aprons ($22) at My Louise (225-448-2093). 6. Fish Fry | 1 p.m. “Swimming on This End. Fried on the Other End,” reads the sign at Tony’s Seafood Market & Deli where fresh specimens are pulled out of the catfish tank on one side of the store and served on po’boys ($6.49) at the other. If you’re averse to the popular option of parking lot dining here, hop back in the car and take your lunch to the grassy lawn fronting the Louisiana State Capitol Building. For dessert: a view from the 27th floor of America’s tallest state capitol, gazing down at the surrounding gardens and historic houses of colorful Spanish Town, home to Baton Rouge’s Mardi Gras festivities. Advertisement 7. Art in the Park | 3 p.m. Head over to another urban green space — the 154-acre City-Brooks Community Park, where the Baton Rouge Gallery Center for Contemporary Art is set in the park’s 1920s-era former pool house. An artists’ cooperative, the space showcases everything from experimental video art to spoken word. Stroll on to the area known as Perkins Road Overpass, where independent boutiques and dining spots are clustered around an Interstate off-ramp. Sip exceptional pour-over coffee at Magpie Cafe, then browse Louisiana history and other rare tomes at Cottonwood Books. 8. Louisiana-Style Pizza | 6 p.m. Yes, it does exist — and locals wouldn’t trade it for a lifetime’s worth of thin-crust Neapolitan slices. Fleur de Lis Pizza, a third-generation family-run business housed in a former cocktail lounge with a neon-lighted exterior, has been serving secret-recipe rectangular pies since the 1940s. The “round the world” pizza ($13 for a large) incorporates anchovies, Italian sausage, mushrooms, pepperoni, salami and onions into a gooey, extra-cheesy pie — crisp and greasy on the bottom, blistery on top. Waits on weekends can be up to an hour; stave off hunger with a pickled egg plucked from the jar on the bar ($1). 9. Hunting for Tunes | 9 p.m. Finding this city’s live music scene can take some legwork, but when you do track down an authentic gig, it’s something special indeed. Occupying a former tavern in a less-than-desirable stretch of town, Red Dragon Listening Room is a nonprofit venue where mismatched couches and church pews face a modest stage hosting folk acts. Cover is usually around $20; the entire amount goes to performers. Down a gravel road just outside town, Teddy’s Juke Joint is a blues-lovers’ twisted fairy tale covered in the sheen of Christmas lights and a glittery disco ball. It’s the kind of place where waitresses hand out gratis Styrofoam cartons of turkey wings because the piano man is celebrating his 88th birthday; and where Teddy, the cowboy-hat-and-cape-clad owner, will serenade you from the D.J. booth, then wax poetic about how he was born right here in this room. SUNDAY 10. Serious Dough | 9 a.m. Hung-over college students and hungry families alike flock to breakfast at Coffee Call, a local institution set in an unsuspecting strip mall. Pillowy beignets ($2.20 for three) are buried in mounds of powdered sugar and enjoyed best when dipped in a steaming mug of café au lait. For a more modern take on fried dough, head to a farther-out strip mall where Jeff Herman, a recent Louisiana State University grad, opened Tiger Deaux-nuts in 2012, dreaming up creative flavors like bananas foster, vanilla-jalapeño and maple-bacon. 11. Geaux-ing Out | 11 a.m. Work off some of that breakfast with a stroll through Bluebonnet Swamp Nature Center, a 103-acre stretch of land where elevated boardwalks wind through cypress and tupelo trees, and hundreds of bird species can be spotted (admission, $3). Continue to the LSU Rural Life Museum, a former plantation where more than 30 preserved historic buildings brought here from across rural Louisiana showcase the state’s wide range of vernacular architecture (admission, $9). 12. River Boat | 2 p.m. Head back downtown and venture on board the U.S.S. Kidd & Veterans Memorial, a 2,050-ton World War II destroyer now on the riverfront. Children especially enjoy crawling across the quarterdeck and through the ship’s well-preserved interior (admission, $8). If there’s still money left in your pocket, hop one vessel over and close out your weekend with blackjack aboard the riverboat portion of Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel. MISS. Plank rd.

Business   Rap Devotee. Advertisement By David Steinberg Feb 18, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — How long did you stare at this puzzle before you spotted the theme? There’s a Notepad on the Across Lite version of the puzzle that says, “The answers to the 13 starred clues follow an unusual two-way progression from 1- to 73-Across. Can you figure out what it is?” Well, sure. But you’re going to have to look very carefully. When the theme emerges for you, like one of those computer-generated 3-D artworks where you have to relax your eyes in order to see the picture, you may not yet fully realize how hard this must have been to construct. Sure, it’s an 80-worder (the usual maximum for a 15 x 15 puzzle is 78), but in order to build this puzzle, David Steinberg had to find words that had certain beginnings and certain endings, then fit them all in the grid and … well, I’m just going to say that this looked like way more work than I would want to put into making a puzzle. You have to respect someone who bends his own rules when it comes to fill just to pull off an idea like this. Still not getting it? O.K., here it is: Each of the answers to the starred (italicized if you’re solving the print version) clues begins with the letters of the first half of the alphabet from A to M, and then, if that wasn’t enough, the last letter of those same words consists of the second half of the alphabet in reverse from Z to M. It’s like watching the figure-skating competitions in the winter Olympics and being amazed when the skater lands a triple lutz-triple toe combination. I still can’t believe Mr. Steinberg was able to land this, and I’ll bet the East German judge would be impressed as well. Mr. Steinberg discusses the mechanics of building this puzzle below, so I’ll just say that the Clues of the Day for me are 31 Down’s “What can get you down?” for EIDER and 1 Down’s “Trip provider?” for ACID. I first came up with the idea for this puzzle when I was 14. I had no idea how I was going to go about squeezing 13 symmetrical theme entries in a particular order into a 15 x 15 grid — I wasn’t even sure I’d be able to come up with a set of theme entries that would work at all! Anyway, the big breakthrough happened when I discovered JOHN Q for the J to Q arrangement. Unfortunately, I then had to find an entry that fit the D???W letter pattern. The only two entries I could find were DO NOW (either a contrived phrase or an awkward partial) and DEPEW (as in Chauncey Depew, a turn-of-the-century politician). I decided that DO NOW was the lesser of two evils and proceeded to the grid. I soon discovered that CHATTERBOX and KARATE CHOP were the same length, which allowed me to open up the grid a bit more, though I was still dissatisfied with the puzzle, since all the other theme entries were very short and the grid had 82 words. Fast forward a few months to April, 2012, after my 15th birthday. I was playing around with this idea some more and, after a substantial amount of grid wrangling, produced an 80-worder that replaced GET AT with GARMENT DISTRICT (a 15-letter entry). The fill had a few compromises and irksome “duplicates” in the down entries like GOES SOFT, though I was still very happy with how it turned out. After I submitted the puzzle, I noticed that I had absentmindedly clued GARMENT DISTRICT as “Big Apple district with many labels”; “Part of Manhattan’s Midtown West” works much better. I also worked on a Z TO A puzzle to complement this one for a little while, though I couldn’t come up with a satisfactory Q*J entry (the best I could think of was QZXJ [“Highest scoring Scrabble tiles”], which I felt would permanently mangle Amy Reynaldo’s Scowl-o-Meter!). In all, this puzzle was a lot of fun to construct, and I hope it makes for a fun solve as well! I spent a lot of time reading SHEL Silverstein’s poetry to my kids when they were younger, but I’ve always loved his career as a musician and lyricist.

Science   A Fresh Case for Breast Self-Exams Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Advice on money and health. Scientists produced dismal news last week about mammograms. After tracking 90,000 women for 25 years, researchers in Canada found that those who received regular mammograms did not experience fewer deaths from breast cancer or from all causes, compared with those who did not. But buried in the news was a nugget of hope: The women who did not receive regular mammograms were instead monitored with physical breast exams that proved effective. All of the participants were taught to examine their own breasts once a month, and specially trained nurses examined women who were in their 50s. This low-tech approach, the researchers found, appeared to be as good as or better than regular mammograms at locating the serious cancers that needed treatment. The study authors are hesitant to draw any firm conclusions, because they did not set out to study manual breast exams per se. But as the data came in, “I began to feel that what the trial was showing was that clinical breast exam was effective and could substitute for mammography, if it was performed well and was accompanied by the teaching of breast self-exam,” said Dr. Anthony B. Miller of the University of Toronto, the study’s lead author. That is a very different message from what women have been hearing. “Before this report came out, I would have said the best role for clinical breast exams is in places where there isn’t good access to mammography, because it’s a reliable way to catch some cancers early, but it’s not as sensitive as mammography,” said Dr. Mary Barton, a vice president at the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a private health care nonprofit, who has studied the performance of clinical breast exams. Now, she said, “the question is: Is mammography too sensitive?” In the Canadian study of women ages 40 to 59, mammography identified more cancers, but overdiagnosis led to unnecessary treatment like chemotherapy. Medical organizations like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists do recommend regular clinical breast exams, performed by doctors or trained nurses, for women beginning at age 20. But self-exams have fallen out of favor. The American Cancer Society offers instructions and suggests women ask their doctors about them, but the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 gave self-exams a “D” grade, saying it was a waste of a time to teach women to do them. Data in support of self-exams have been “really murky,” said Dr. Elizabeth Steiner, director of the breast health education program at Oregon Health and Science University’s Knight Cancer Institute. Still, she believes there are good reasons to encourage women to do self-exams. “Who’s going to know your breasts better?” she said. “Your doctor, who does an exam once a year, or you, who does it every month?” There is not a lot of research to support clinical breast exams, either, but Dr. Steiner said, “I personally do think more health care providers need to be trained to do high-quality clinical breast exams.” Given the debate over mammography, you would think that scientists would be taking a harder look at alternatives. But a randomized clinical trial comparing clinical breast exams with no care is unlikely, said Dr. Cornelia J. Baines, an author of the Canadian mammography study. “Everyone’s looking for a technological fix, not what fingers can do,” she said. If you are looking for a clinical breast exam, find a provider who has received training in the so-called vertical-strip, three-pressure method, which calls for moving the fingers up and down along the chest area, rather than in circular motions around the breast, and palpating lightly, then a little more firmly and then deeply in each spot. Done properly, it is time-consuming, taking at least three minutes for each breast. One study found that the exams were more reliable when they were not performed during a patient visit that included other demanding tasks, like Pap smears. The clinician should examine the entire chest area, not just the breast — all the way up to the neck or collarbone, into the armpit, over the center of the chest, and under the breast into the rib cage. The exam should also include a visual inspection of the breasts while the patient is asked to stand in different poses. This can make some patients, and physicians, uncomfortable. Detailed instructions for a self-exam are available on many breast cancer websites. You may want to ask a health provider for guidance as well. The optimal time for a self-exam is just after your period. Start by standing in front of a mirror and examining your breasts for any unusual dimpling or asymmetry, changes or discharges from the nipple, redness or rashes. To examine your breast, lie on your back and raise an arm above your head. Use your other hand to examine the breast beneath the raised arm; rely on the pads of your fingers, not the tips. Use three levels of pressure: light, then medium and then firm to feel near the ribs. Physical breast exams can miss tumors, or lead to overdiagnosis and treatment of lumps that turn out to be harmless. Still, Dr. Steiner said, “High-quality clinical breast exams are less likely to give you a false positive and might, in skilled hands, be less likely to give you a false negative.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/18/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Fresh Case for Breast Self-Exams.

Sports   NBC Pushes Too Far in Bringing Bode Miller to Tears. Advertisement Advertisement TV Sports By RICHARD SANDOMIR FEB. 17, 2014 Bode Miller had just tied for a bronze medal in the men’s super-G at the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Sunday and it was time to be interviewed. NBC had already established Miller’s quest as an emotional story line, putting a microphone on his wife, Morgan, to hear her reactions to his races, and having the couple sit for an interview with Tom Brokaw. He was being humanized — as the changed man, the family man, the mature 36-year-old whose brother had died last year. This is the type of storytelling that lubricates NBC’s prime-time Olympic engine. This time, the engine backfired. It was not out of bounds for NBC’s Christin Cooper to ask a medal winner questions about his brother’s death. (Miller’s brother, Chelone, was a snowboarder who died last year at 29.) It was a relevant area to pursue, part of his Olympic biography. And Miller brought it up in response to her first question, saying that he had “a lot of emotion riding” on the race. Cooper picked up on that quickly and asked, “Bode, you’re showing so much emotion down here, what’s going through your mind?” That probably should have been the last question about his brother. This was, after all, an interview with a great skier who had just won a bronze medal, the sixth Olympic medal of his career. He had done no wrong to be milked for more emotion than he wanted to reveal. Cooper needed to strike a far better balance in her questions so that the takeaway for viewers would not be that she was badgering him. Advertisement Maybe the absence of detail in his answer — he said only that it had been “a long struggle coming in here. And, uh, just a tough year” — compelled her to go forward. “I know you wanted to be here with Chelly experiencing these games; how much does it mean to you to come up with a great performance for him? And was it for him?” she said. Now she was sounding intrusive, and maybe doubting his fraternal inspiration. It was one question too many, at least the way it was phrased. But it pushed Miller into a thoughtful answer — that he did not know if he had won a medal for his brother or to “make myself proud.” Advertisement He was holding up, but tears had started to trickle down Miller’s face. He was being a stand-up guy, even if he was being pulled through a wringer. Now was truly the time to stop. If you’ve made a medal winner cry, it is time to simply say “thank you” and move on. It was on tape, so NBC could have cut it off and gone to Matt Lauer in the studio. Instead, Cooper forged on, wondering whom he seemed to be talking to when he looked up in the sky before he started his run down the mountain. It was not a bad question, but by this point, it was overkill. “What’s going on there?” she said. Miller’s helmeted head was bowed and he was unable to answer. The clock kept ticking, and I expected NBC to turn its camera elsewhere or for Cooper to say, “Thanks, Bode, you had a great race.” That did not happen. And there was no interview with the gold medalist, Kjetil Jansrud, to plug in and change the tempo. Instead, Cooper, a former Olympian who won a silver medal in the giant slalom at the 1984 Games, tried to comfort Miller, putting a hand on his shoulder. In all, NBC lingered over this scene for 75 seconds — as Miller continued to weep, as he walked away, as he was comforted and as his wife embraced him. He might have cried on his own, for his brother, for joy, for the way his life had changed. But had the tears not been provoked by Cooper’s questions, we probably would not have seen that emotion. Dan Hicks, who called the super-G race for NBC, talked over some of this tearful imagery — unnecessarily — mentioning how Miller had seemed like a different skier than in the past and how his emotions “continued to flow out.” Yep, we saw that. Advertisement Emotion is a real and honest element of athletic triumph and defeat. And you don’t want a network to tell its journalists to stick to soft questions when interviewing the winners. But in this instance, Cooper and NBC lacked the sensitivity to know when enough was enough. It did not end there. Later Sunday, Miller visited Matt Lauer in the studio on Sunday night. “You always strike me as someone who likes to keep your emotions pretty close to your vest, and yet this has been a pretty challenging year for you,” Lauer said to Miller, again bringing up his brother’s death and his public custody battle. Miller, who did not bring up the interview, said he talked to his brother at the start, saying “give me a couple hundreths today, give me that little extra push.”  He continued: “Then for it to come down and be as close as it can possibly get in ski racing and end up with a medal, it just seemed kind of connected.  At that point, I was just pretty overwhelmed with the feeling of getting a little bit of help from my brother.” Battered by online criticism of Christin Cooper’s interview of Miller after it was broadcast Sunday night, NBC released a statement Monday. “Our intent was to convey the emotion that Bode Miller was feeling after winning his bronze medal,” a spokesman for the network said. “We understand how some viewers thought the line of questioning went too far, but it was our judgment that his answers were a necessary part of the story. We’re gratified that Bode has been publicly supportive of Christin Cooper and the overall interview.” Miller also came to Cooper’s defense in a pair of posts on Twitter on Monday and expanded on those comments in an interview on NBC’s “Today” with Lauer. “I’ve known Christin a long time, and she is a sweetheart of a person,” Miller said. “I know she didn’t mean to push. I don’t think she really anticipated what my reaction was going to be, and I think by the time she sort of realized it, I think it was too late and I don’t really, I don’t blame her at all.” He continued: “I feel terrible that she is taking the heat for that because it really is just a heat of the moment kind of circumstance, and I don’t think there was any harm intended. So, it was just a lot of emotion for me, it’s been a lot over the last year and that you sometimes don’t realize how much you contain that stuff until the dam breaks and then it’s just a real outpouring.” See More » Go to Home Page »

Business   Motivational Words. Advertisement By Michael Dewey Feb 19, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — Atten-shun! Eyes right here, soldiers, we’ve got us a puzzle to discuss. Michael Dewey made his New York Times debut two years ago and he’s back today with a military theme that not only orders us around, but also answers his own orders with a “SIR, YES SIR!” on the diagonal (at 11 Down, 39 Across and 58 Down). Some people don’t like seeing repeated words in their grid, but here it’s clued so that it’s part of the theme in a way. The rest of the theme is a series of military commands, clued punnily. Of these, I thought that PRESENT ARMS had the best visual, phlebotomally speaking, unless you get queasy, in which case FORWARD MARCH works well, too. I wasn’t comfortable with the cluing for READY AIM FIRE and it adds a theme element that contains three words instead of two, but I can’t think of another way to clue that phrase that doesn’t have to do with actually firing a weapon. DIPHTHONG is not only a fun word to say, but it makes its debut in the New York Times crosswords today, along with three of the four theme entries, IMPIETY and PRESORTED. There’s some crosswordese in here and I would have liked to have had a bit more wordplay in the cluing at midweek, but all in all, a fun and attention-holding experience. At ease, everyone, while we hear from Mr. Dewey. Smoke ’em if you got ’em: This is my second New York Times puzzle publication. As an educator, husband and father, I have to credit my loved ones and students as the inspiration for my puzzle ideas. My wife lets me bounce my crazy ideas off her, my Dad filled my childhood with puns, and my Mom taught me to laugh at myself and to use humor when things grow uneasy. For example, awaiting the needle before donating at our school blood drive, I tried to cut the tension by saying, “PRESENT ARMS.” Nearby students thought it was funny, but my phlebotomist was all business. Later on, I was in dad mode when I told my boys to “FORWARD MARCH” upstairs to bed. My oldest gave me a mock salute and said, “SIR, YES SIR!” Et voila! The theme was born. From there, the trick was to come up with the right combination of military commands with matching letter counts. COMPANY HALT worked nicely, but ABOUT FACE didn’t make the final grid. I thought the fourth entry, READY AIM FIRE, added a little extra challenge because it contained three words instead of two. Plus that pattern gets echoed in the three-word response, albeit as separate entries. Upon cluing, I already had “what blood donors do first” for PRESENT ARMS, and the others followed fairly easily. Will’s editing bailed me out on 20 Across; originally, I had “Blunt month?” as the clue for FORWARD MARCH. The grid went through a number of iterations (I played with moving the two “SIR” entries around the grid) before Will gave his final stamp of approval. Kudos to him for his patience! I was also happy to place DIPHTHONG, PRESORTED and IMPIETY (three new New York Times puzzle words, if I’m not mistaken) into the grid. Lastly, I offer a genuine salute to all of our past and present military personnel. Thank you for the sacrifices you make to keep us safe! Peace to all. Peace to you as well, Mr. Dewey. Hope to see you again soon. The very tall and dapper Tom Gaffney will be sitting in for me once again while I am on vacation. When I return, I will be bringing news from the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, being held March 7-9 in Brooklyn.

Science   The Podcast Hits the Road. Advertisement Advertisement By JEFFERY DelVISCIOFEB. 17, 2014 This week the Science Times podcast hit the road. I traveled to Chicago for the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science conference. It’s a lot like amotorized scientific buffet. Lots of subjects, with tons of cool science all crammed into a couple of Windy City days. I couldn’t hope to tell you about everything, so I had to be choosy. Have you ever played with the Google Earth program? If so, you have probably gone from a vantage point above the virtual earth all the way down to street level in one continuous zoom. You can think of this week’s program as just that — a continuous zoom… with three stops along the way. First stop: above Earth, where we will talk to the first American woman to walk in space. She still spends a lot of time peering at our world from great heights, but now she does that from executive office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington Next we zoom from space to city level and talk to a crowd of experts on the future of the city. Then we will finish our trip by zooming straight into the human body. Advertisement _________________________________ WATCHING OUR EYES IN THE SKIES Kathryn Sullivan is just about as comfortable as any person can be watching Earth from above. She flew on three NASA missions, spending more than 530 hours and traveling 8.6 million miles in orbit. Today, she still spends a lot of time poring over Earth from above. But now, she’s on the ground, inside the executive office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration where she is currently the acting head of the agency. President Obama sent her nomination to the Senate last August. She appeared for a confirmation hearing before the Senate a month later. Her confirmation is still pending. We spoke about the role of the agency in weather forecasting and climate prediction, as well as her childhood affinity for maps and the state of grade school geography today. (Download the interview here.) ____________________________________________ CITIES OF THE PRESENT, CITIES OF THE FUTURE Joan Clos, the head of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, put the current population of worldwide urban dwellers at 3.5 billion. He also estimated that that number could double in 30 to 40 years. The pressures of a growing population, aging infrastructure and the threat of climate change will strain cities worldwide in the coming years. What have we learned so far about how cities function — and how they don’t? What is the role of that most symbolic of city features, the skyscraper? And is it possible to “break” a city? Five experts offered their perspectives on the use of data to solve urban problems, the ways in which the skyscraper is venerated and misused, and their best guesses on what the cities of the future might look like. They are: William F. Baker, a structural engineering partner at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Wiel Arets, architect and dean, Illinois Institute of Technology College of Architecture; Virginia Parks, associate professor, School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago; Saskia Sassen, a professor of sociology at Columbia University; and Antony Wood, the executive director of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. (Download the interview here.) __________________________ VIRTUALIZING OUR BODIES We’ve all heard of virtual reality. But what about virtual body organs? New advances in computing power are allowing scientists to create digital versions of working brains and livers that try to model everything from drug damage to the way we act. Some of these simulations can, potentially, give us the freedom to transition away from using laboratory animals to test our drugs. Vijay Chandru’s virtual liver is meant to do just that. His company, Strand Biosciences, created the virtual liver by integrating the results of more than 3,000 scientific papers into how the model works. It is meant to simulate a normal liver — and it is also meant to, harmlessly, take the toxic insults that Dr. Chandru’s team feeds it in the form of virtual toxins and new drugs. Other models can act like simplified versions of humans, taking in information and acting on it. Terrence Stewart, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Waterloo in Canada worked on a brain model called Spaun. That’s the brain and tongue saving acronym for Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network. Spaun takes its two and a half million virtual neurons and puts them to certain tasks. It has a virtual eye to see the task it is given and a virtual arm to draw its response on a virtual pad. Other researchers think that in order to truly understand health, wellness and disease, an individual human must create he or her own data cloud, which can be recorded, decoded and summarized so that the patient can act on that information. For Leroy Hood, the president of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, it’s the best way to catch disease in the body before it actually takes hold . He has just started a nine-month trial to create virtual patient data clouds for 100 volunteers. He says the study is just a prelude: He hopes one day to enroll 100,000 patients for a decades-long trial. (Download the interview here.)

Travel   At a California Resort, a Tequila Tutorial. Advertisement A resort in Southern California is capitalizing on the recent proliferation of mezcal and other agave-derived liquor distilleries to draw new devotees to a members-only club. The Rancho Valencia Resort and Spa near San Diego recently started its All Agave Project, a series of seminars and tastings for the cocktail crowd. The project, created by Chris Simmons, the hotel’s certified catador, or taster, offers guests and visitors several options to get to know more about Mexican liquors — in particular, exotic tequilas and their more potent country relatives, mezcal, bacanora and sotol, many of which were banned from sale until the 1990s. The All Agave Tasting Tour, hosted in the resort’s Pony Room lounge, teaches guests about the history of the craft, a process that involves cultivating and roasting agave and then fermenting the juices. Monthly “Sip Sesh” seminars with master distillers and owners gives a more in-depth picture of the various processes used by different distilleries, accompanied by tastings. And an annual membership to the hotel’s All Agave Club includes both tasting tours and discounted monthly seminars , as well as special members-only tastings, events and, thoughtfully, a complimentary flask. The next series of Sip Sesh seminars will be lead by Jim Riley, the chief executive of Azuñia Tequila (Feb. 20); Gary Eisenberger, a founder of Karma Tequila (March 20); and Barry Augus, a founder and chief executive of Tres Agaves Tequila (April 17).

Business   Yahoo Introduces Service for Buying Mobile Ads. Advertisement   The new service, Yahoo Gemini, is an online marketplace for buying mobile search and so-called native advertisements, ads that look similar to editorial content, the company said in a blog post. The service is available through a broader self-service tool called Yahoo Ad Manager that is used to buy online advertisements. Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, has made mobile initiatives part of her turnaround plan for the company, which has fallen behind other companies, notably Google and Facebook, that earn their fortunes from online advertising. Yahoo spent $1.1 billion last year to acquire Tumblr, a social networking company with a strong presence in mobile. With the new service, Yahoo is also increasing its efforts to become a more significant player in both mobile and web-based native advertising, a newer form of online marketing generating interest — and controversy. When native ads appear in online publications, they are typically made to look like stories and other editorial content While publishers, including The New York Times, label native ads that appear on their sites, they have still raised concerns among some media critics about a blurring of lines between advertising and editorial. In the blog post announcing Yahoo Gemini, Jay Rossiter, senior vice president of Yahoo’s cloud platform group and Adam Cahan, senior vice president of mobile and emerging products, wrote that the service will give advertisers a way to “get the performance and ease of search, combined with the scale and creativity of native advertising.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/20/2014, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Yahoo Introduces Service for Buying Mobile Ads.

Foreign   Latest Attacks on Doctors Prompt New Call for Deterrent Measures. Advertisement On Monday, Sun Dongtao, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Qiqihar Beigang Hospital, in the northern province of Heilongjiang, was beaten to death with an iron bar by a patient unhappy with his treatment, the state news agency Xinhua reported. On Tuesday, Li Aixin, a doctor at the Yi County People’s Hospital in Hebei Province was stabbed in the throat by a patient dissatisfied with the outcome of an operation. Dr. Li’s windpipe was cut open and his thyroid gland severed, but he survived, according to the Jinghua Times. The two attacks this week are part of a long line of violence against doctors in China that has spooked the profession. In October, hundreds of medical personnel demonstrated outside the No. 1 People’s Hospital in Wenling in Zhejiang Province, where a man had stabbed three doctors, killing one. They held signs reading: “Restore My Dignity” and “Defend Justice.”  The reasons for the violence vary but are believed to be tied to public perceptions of excessive health care costs, corruption among doctors and medical institutions, and poor bedside manners by physicians. Patients who pay high fees or bribes for operations expect to be healed, and when they are not, may react violently. Medical industry representatives have called for harsher punishments for attackers, an appeal repeated this week by Deng Liqiang, the head of the legal department of the Chinese Medical Doctors Association. “In recent years the punishments for many violent attacks on doctors have been insufficient and the deterrent too low,” The China Youth Daily quoted him as saying. “That won’t contain violent attacks or deter imitators,” it quoted Mr. Deng as saying. Meanwhile, the head of Yi County People’s Hospital, Zhao Shuangan, told the newspaper that the police were providing 24-hour patrols of the facility since the attack on Dr. Li. Mr. Zhao said the attack had caused “panic” among the hospital staff, but everything was now operating “normally.” Dr. Li was still unable to speak, but was expected to recover, he said. The Ministry of Public Security and the National Health and Family Planning Commission said in October that in 2012, there were 11 violent attacks on medical staff at hospitals in eight provinces and municipalities, leaving seven people dead and 28 wounded, including doctors, patients and a security guard. Other figures suggest broader violence: Since 2002, attacks have risen by an average of nearly 23 percent a year, the China Hospital Management Society said in a paper published in December in Chinese Community Doctors, a medical journal.

Science   Study Finds Drops Are Best Treatment for Ear Tube-Related Dripping Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement For children with ear tubes, topical antibiotic drops treat the leaky discharge caused by an ear infection much more effectively than oral antibiotics or observation, according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday. Each year, roughly 670,000 children in the United States have tiny plastic tubes placed in the eardrum in one of the most common surgeries of childhood. If the ear gets infected afterward, clear or bloody discharge can drip out, and a foul smell may be noticeable. This condition of drippy ears, which may or may not be painful, is known as tympanostomy tube otorrhea. In a 2013 study, 67 percent of children who had ear tubes put in experienced one or more episodes of otorrhea in the year after the procedure. Smaller trials with different designs have found that ear drops are more effective than systemic antibiotics for this common problem. But the new study is the first to include a no-treatment, wait-and-see group, and provides the best evidence to date for the superiority of ear drops for children with tubes. “This is a big study, very high quality and very rigorous. It’s more of a definitive study,” said Dr. Richard M. Rosenfeld, chairman of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who was not involved in the research. Putting drops into the ear canal, he said, is akin to “dropping a Scud missile on the bacteria.” There are two benefits, he said. “It resolves the otorrhea more effectively and faster than oral medicine,” he said. “More importantly, you avoid the problem of resistant germs, which is a major, major problem.” In the new study, 230 children ages 1 to 10 with acute tube discharge were randomly assigned to three groups: some got ear drops, some got oral antibiotics, and some were simply observed. At two weeks, 5 percent of the children treated with drops still had discharge from an infection, compared with 44 percent of those treated with oral antibiotics and 55 percent of those who were only observed. The study suggests that drippy ears in children with tubes might take two weeks or longer to resolve without treatment — a long time if the child has trouble sleeping or cannot participate in activities. “No previous study assessed the actual need to treat these children,” said Dr. Thijs M.A. van Dongen, the lead author of the study and an epidemiologist at University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. In a six-month follow-up, the study found that children who were not treated for the first two weeks had a median total of 18 days of discharge, compared with five days for those who got ear drops, and 13.5 days for those given oral antibiotics. “It’s better to start treatment quickly after onset of symptoms,” Dr. van Dongen said. “They improve more quickly, and they have less recurrence in following months.” But Dr. Rosenfeld said it was not clear that all children with tube otorrhea should promptly start ear drops. Watching and waiting is an option, he said, if the drainage is not profuse and causes no discomfort, and the child still sleeps and acts normally. Drops can be expensive, and if used excessively they can cause hard-to-treat yeast overgrowth. Last July, practice guidelines issued by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery strongly recommended that clinicians prescribe only topical antibiotic ear drops for children with uncomplicated cases of tube discharge. But some pediatricians and family physicians still routinely prescribe systemic antibiotics for these cases. Among otolaryngologists, the new guidelines are “fairly well accepted,” said Dr. Joseph E. Kerschner, a professor of otolaryngology and the dean of the medical school at Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. “Still, there’s evidence that not all physicians have gotten the message.” A 2013 survey found that 54 percent of emergency-medicine physicians used oral antibiotics to treat an ear infection in a child with ear tubes, compared with just 9 percent of ear, nose and throat doctors, almost all of whom used topical antibiotics. Most children do not see ear, nose and throat specialists first, said Dr. Seth R. Schwartz, an otolaryngologist and the director of the Listen for Life Center at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, so “it’s important that all physicians who treat children with this condition are aware.” The bottom line is that “oral antibiotics don’t work well” in these cases, he said, and they may cause stomach upset or diarrhea. In an uncomplicated case of tube discharge, Dr. Kerschner advised parents to say to pediatricians, “’Hey, my kid has a draining ear, how about using topical antibiotics instead of oral antibiotics?’ The child will get better faster and more reliably.” In children without ear tubes who get an ear infection, drops are not effective as they cannot get behind the ear drum. For those children, oral antibiotics are a common treatment. Lately, Dr. Schwartz said, “there’s a higher recognition that you can treat with observation initially with close follow-up.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/20/2014, on page A11 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Study Finds Drops Are Best Treatment for Ear Tube-Related Discharge in Children.

Business   Of Clogs and Cordwainers. Advertisement By Patrick Berry Feb 21, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — There’s no unifying theme in this Friday puzzle from Patrick Berry, but he has decided to GO BIG OR GO HOME by stacking the puzzle with plenty of brilliantly worded clues that tease the solver with double meanings and subtle misdirection. For starters, we’re given the entry “much-hailed group” for CABS, and “one with a thing for laughter” for PROP COMIC, where you need to read between the lines to get the real meaning of his carefully chosen words. Later on, we come across “needs” for DEARTHS and “leaves from the Orient” for GREEN TEA. I probably had the hardest time with that last one, simply because I assumed that “leaves” meant “departs,” so all my guesses had to do with traveling west. It took quite a few crossers and more than a little head scratching before I realized Patrick meant tea. Maybe I need some caffeine. It’s also noteworthy how many rarely seen words Patrick managed to work into the puzzle. For example, there’s a clue about a cordwainer, more commonly known as a SHOEMAKER. Some of the other words you don’t see everyday include OAST and REDCAP. Since we have a mention of a Songwriter Hall of Fame member, Bob SEGER, let’s listen to one of his songs: What did you think?

Foreign   Obama’s Plan to Meet Dalai Lama Draws Swift Chinese Rebuke. Advertisement President Obama plans to meet at the White House on Friday with the Dalai Lama, a visit that drew a swift rebuke from the Chinese government, which has tried to diminish the influence of the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader and his efforts to promote the autonomy of Tibet. The administration portrayed the visit as part of an effort to promote a “middle way” solution to the fate of Tibet, where China has been trying to tamp down a stubborn movement for greater autonomy that has involved the self-immolation of more than 125 Tibetans, mostly monks and nuns, since 2008. “The president will meet with the Dalai Lama in his capacity as an internationally respected religious and cultural leader,” said a statement issued late Thursday by Caitlin Hayden, a National Security Council spokeswoman. “The United States supports the Dalai Lama’s ‘middle way’ approach of neither assimilation nor independence for Tibetans in China,” Ms. Hayden said. “We will continue to urge the Chinese government to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, as a means to reduce tensions.” But the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the planned visit just hours after it was announced, with a spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, urging that the meeting be canceled and calling it a “crude interference in China’s domestic affairs.” She said holding it would “seriously damage” already strained ties between China and the United States. The Chinese government considers the Tibetan spiritual leader a separatist, and bans open displays of his photograph in Tibet. In an article published in November, the top Communist Party official in Tibet signaled how China was planning to clamp down on the Dalai Lama’s ability to get his message out. “Strike hard against the reactionary propaganda,” Chen Quanguo, the party chief in Tibet, wrote in the party journal Qiushi. He said the government would confiscate illegal satellite dishes, heighten monitoring of online content and take other measures to prevent the dissemination of the Dalai Lama’s message in areas with Tibetan populations so that “the voice and image of the enemy forces and the Dalai clique are neither seen nor heard.” The Dalai Lama was also in Washington for a meeting Thursday with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative organization. In a possible reflection of the political sensitivities of the meeting with Mr. Obama, it will not take place in the Oval Office, but rather in the White House’s map room. The White House visit comes as Washington’s relations with Beijing have already been strained by territorial disputes between China and key American allies, including Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, involving competing claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea. In 2009, Mr. Obama declined to meet with the Dalai Lama before a planned trip to China, a decision that was widely criticized. However, he did meet him after his return. This time, the meeting will occur before Mr. Obama’s April trip to Asia, when he will visit American allies in a trip that will bypass China. In the Foreign Ministry statement, Ms. Hua accused the United States of meddling in China’s internal affairs by going ahead with the visit. “It must be pointed out that Tibetan affairs are purely a domestic matter of China, and no foreign country has the right to meddle,” she said. “The Dalai is a political exile who for a long time has wielded the banner of religion to engage in anti-China separatist activities.” Chris Buckley contributed reporting.

Home   The Power of Sticker Shock. Advertisement Advertisement On Location By SARAH AMELAR FEB. 19, 2014 The idea of wrapping a house in giant graphic stickers, like the ones used for ads on city buses, appealed to Eric Chu the moment his architect suggested it. But then, Mr. Chu, 38, rarely shies away from trying something new. After starting a computer hardware and software business when he was barely 20, Mr. Chu, who was born in Taiwan, owned a restaurant, invested in real estate and designed furniture that he welded himself. As he put it, “I definitely approach life with a ‘why not?’ philosophy.” Like many Los Angeles homeowners whose property is zoned R-2 (or two-family), Mr. Chu had decided to replace the single, modest home on his lot with two houses — one to live in and the other to rent out. But as spacious backyards throughout the city give way to revenue-earning second units, the land between the front and back houses can be odd territory, where privacy is elusive. Applying colorful, blown-up photos to the exterior glass walls — allowing daytime views out, but not in — was the unconventional solution proposed by Mr. Chu’s architect, Whitney Sander, who runs Sander Architects with his wife, Catherine Holliss. For a lot nearly 150 feet deep but little more than 40 feet wide, Mr. Sander designed two three-story houses — Mr. Chu’s 2,200-square-foot unit and a slightly larger one behind — separated by a drive-in courtyard. Mr. Sander was planning to use translucent acrylic panels for the two walls that face each other when he chanced upon something much better: a perforated, adhesive-backed film, custom-printed by Astek Wallcoverings, which was suitable for floor-to-ceiling windows. A close-up photo Mr. Chu had snapped of a sapling, and then computer-manipulated, became the wrapping for those two facades. Suddenly, they could have it all: daylight, views out and privacy. (The sustainability-minded architects were also pleased to discover that the film offered another benefit: a 50 percent reduction in sun infiltration.) For the other facades, the designers chose a different strategy, veiling them in a sunshade of diagonal aluminum angles. But long before the building’s skin went up, the skeleton was stopping traffic, Mr. Sander said: “People would pull up in their cars and ask, ‘What’s going on?’ ” Passers-by were curious about the diagonal screen, as well as the quickly assembled structural-steel frame. Common to much of Mr. Sander’s work, it is a custom-modified prefab system of recycled-metal components typically used in pre-engineered warehouses or agricultural buildings. Advertisement One of those who stopped was Lucas Ma, an architect-turned-real-estate-investor, who was eyeing the rental unit. After it was completed two years ago, he and his wife, Joyce Wong, moved in with their young daughter. Mr. Chu now lives in the two-bedroom front house with his longtime girlfriend, Katie Freeman, 29, a massage therapist; one of the bedrooms is his office. The paired townhouses, which cost about $1.4 million, share a material and stylistic sensibility, with rooftop decks, floors of concrete, hardwood or bamboo, vivid ceramic tile, raw-steel stairways and professional-grade appliances. But they differ in layout: While the soaring, double-height main space in the tenants’ unit is a kitchen-and-dining area, it’s a living room in the owner’s home. “The front house feels very well suited to my needs,” Mr. Chu said. But since moving in, he added, he has learned at least one surprising thing: During the day, light-colored graphics offer more privacy than dark ones. Still, “that’s an easy fix,” he said. “We could swap the image. Maybe next time, it’ll be a photo of dandelions.” A version of this article appears in print on February 20, 2014, on page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Power of Sticker Shock.

Science   Living With Cancer: Wigged Out Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The targeted cancer drug extending my life is killing my hair. Especially at the top of my head, a beige scalp gleams through sparse black and white wires. For obvious reasons, I’m not complaining. During chemo, when I lost my hair before, I resorted to scarves and hats, assuming it would grow back. But now I need to continue taking the experimental pills in a clinical trial and therefore suspect that I will continue to lose, rather than regain, hair. To my eyes, male-pattern baldness looks worse (on me) than totally-bald cancer patient mindfully contemplating her mortality like a Buddhist nun. Not so to my haircutter. When I gave her a choice between President Obama and Captain Jean Luc Picard at my last appointment, she chose the President, albeit with a receding hairline. Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer.  The vast majority of people in cancer treatment suffer from an injured body and an injured body image. Baldness but also scars, lopsidedness, weight gain or loss, patches, rashes, prosthetic devices, output bags and ports function like billboards. Some courageous patients determine to expose themselves publicly in order to witness and protest the epidemic; others become agoraphobic, unwilling to leave home. Unfortunately, I dwell in the latter category. What wouldn’t I give now for the hair that drove me crazy in my teens? Thick and kinky, it led me to sleep with huge plastic rollers. To make it look like Cher’s, I would spend hours blow drying or ironing it or using chemicals to straighten it — which would work until the first inkling of humidity turned me into the Bride of Frankenstein. In my 50s, I finally relinquished Cher for a cropped Halle Berry, not that anyone would have discerned any resemblance whatsoever. Maybe the dream of moveable hair, crazed though it was, could rescue me, I determined as I phoned my friend Alexandra, a costume designer, for a date the next day. We drove to the only store in our small town that sells wigs. Its jokey name, though potentially objectionable to Native Americans, seemed a harbinger of moveable hair: The Wig Wam. Once inside the rickety house, we were greeted by Charlotte, the 80-something owner, who ushered us into an enclosed porch. After I took off my hat and Charlotte tousled what little hair I had, she assured me that I did not need to shave my head, wash the wig or do anything except — at this moment she grabbed her own hair and pulled it off her head — wear it and stay away from hot ovens. Why not have fun with this, Alex immediately proposed, bringing me a black shoulder-length mop fringed with red tips — perfect if I were auditioning for a movie version of “The Inferno.” But Charlotte firmly placed a short silver mane on my head, explaining that there was a woman who sat behind her in church who always tugged on the hair at the nape of her neck, to assure herself it was not real. If realism was the point, the synthetic wig was a dud. It looked like a rug, no question. But what a rug! Imagine Meg Ryan in her late 60s. It was definitely moveable hair: moveable bangs, moveable flip in the back, and moveable shaggy sides that could be partly tucked behind the ears and partly smoothed down before the ears against my cheeks. For days afterward it sat in the bathroom atop a phrenology bust that my husband donated from his study. The head’s scalp was divided into sections with letters and numbers so that 19th-century scientists could hazard guesses about real brains to prove that women of all races and all men except whites were endowed by their creator with alienable rights. Getting used to two faces was not easy. Without the wig I look like a sickly Jewish man. But with the wig I am a vibrant, if older, shiksa who could toss her moveable hair at any country club longingly visited by a Philip Roth protagonist. (I should add that in my family the Yiddish word for a non-Jewish woman is spoken with appreciation, not opprobrium.) The shiksa’s name is Sally. Sally draws on eyebrows, while I do not. Sally primps before the mirror, though I do not. Sally’s head is generally itchy, whereas mine is not. Ensconced in some free-floating anxiety about duplicity, I’m not trying to fool anyone, I assure myself. I swear that I am not attempting to pass. I won’t be her — I mean, I won’t wear it — all the time. Instead, I’ll let her — I’ll let it — help me get through select occasions. Still, the suspicion persists. Maybe I need my head examined, but ever since Meg Ryan was spotted at a coffee shop in town, I expect that someone will come up to Sally in the supermarket to ask for her autograph. Walking down the aisles, I decide to choose ingredients to cook something on the stove top (not in the oven) that Sally might enjoy. I’ll have what she’s having.

Sports   Women’s Figure Skating Live Updates. Advertisement Kim Yu-Na was knocked off the perch at the top of women’s figure skating by a young up-and-comer from Russia, Adelina Sotnikova, who used a boost from the home crowd to become the first Russian woman to win a gold medal in women’s singles. Kim, 23, the defending Olympic gold medalist took the ice with the pressure of trying to become the third woman ever to win a second gold medal in the event. She stayed on her feet, skating elegantly but without the command she showed in winning the event in Vancouver four years ago. Sotnikova put the pressure on with a spectacular long program that thrilled the Russian crowd. She seemed to gain strength from the crowd and the pressure of competing at a home Olympics, where the more highly touted teenager, the 15-year-old Yulia Lipnitskaya fell twice in her long program and slipped to fifth. Sotnikova, 17, hit all of her jumps and put up a strong long program score of 149.95 and that left the issue up to Kim, who skated last. Kim hit all of her elements, but did not match the score of Sotnikova. Carolina Kostner, the 27-year-old from Italy, won the bronze, the first medal in her three Olympic appearances. The American skaters in the final group, Gracie Gold and Ashley Wagner, skated well. Gold fell once, but otherwise put on a strong showing, and Wagner had an energetic, largely clean program. Gold finished fourth and Wagner seventh.  See all of the jumps from the women’s free skate.  Sotnikova’s skate had a little more pop, a little more emotional risk, and she is rewarded for her bravery under pressure. Kim will go down as one of the greatest women’s skaters of all time, but not a back-to-back Olympic gold medalist. No, no, no, Yuna is in second? Adelina Sotnikova of Russia wins the Olympic gold. Carolina Kostner is in third. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER And the Olympic champion is … Sotnikova. Kim scores a 144.19, for a total of 219.11. Sotnikova wins because she did seven triples. Kim had 6. Kostner wins bronze. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER And we have reached the end, with the reigning champion Kim. She knew exactly what she had to do to retain her crown. Hard to tell if she was stressed, as Kim looked so composed and sure. Felt like she would do the same perfect skate in an empty rink, or before the whole world. It was a smart, precise skate. Not even a smile at the end, like she knew this was business as usual. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  The American Ashley Wagner is happy with her free skate. She stayed on her feet, and looked confident. Any doubters about her placement, after her weak nationals, should be quieted. But she could have some deductions on her jumps, for two-footing. The opening combo was definitely under-rotated on the back end triple toe. Wagner is sixth, scoring 193.20. Her free earned 127.99. Sotnikova leads, Kostner second, and Gold third. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Wagner delivered the goods in the team event a sharp contrast from her performance at nationals in Boston last month. Ashley Wagner ends up in 6th. She didn’t bring down the house. But, as I said before, the judges here just don’t like her. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — MARY PILON The American Gracie Gold had to know that her free had to be a no-mistake zone in order to be in medal contention. She fell on her triple flip attempt but had the strength to pull it together and skate clean the rest of the program. There were a lot of strong elements, especially her opening triple loop-triple toe. Nice job by Gold, but no medal in Sochi. Gold moves into third, with a 205.53. Personal best score. Gracie Gold might look like Barbie, but she’s one tough athlete. She’s exceeded expectations here, no matter where she finishes. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Adelina Sotnikova might have just cheered up an entire country with that long program. Russia, crushed by its men’s hockey team’s flop, had turned to women’s figure skating for some measure of joy. Yulia Lipnitskaya couldn’t hold up under that pressure. Sotnikova did hold up, soaring through her long program to climb into first place, where she will put the pressure on Kim Yu-na, who skates last. Russia’s Adelina Sotnikova is in first now, and the crowd erupts in cheers. Was she better than Kostner, though? Debatable. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Russia’s Adelina Sotnikova has been the night’s best skater, so far, throwing down a new standard with her effortless – and nearly perfect – program. She was on fire. Great, and unusual, choreography, too. Sotinkova, who came in second to Kim Yu-na in the short, has showed she is here to win. She looks thrilled with her skate, covering her mouth with her hands in happy shock. Mary reports from the Palace that it’s “impossible to count the number of Russian flags waving for Sotnikova right now. This is by far the biggest applause I’ve seen here for anyone, and the poor flower-fetch girls are barely keeping up with the bouquets being tossed out.” The crowd, anxious for her score, begins chanting furiously. HUGE score for Sotinkova, 149.95, moving into first with a 224.59. That’s 22 points above her season’s best total. Shock and happiness in kiss-and-cry. Sotnikova is 8 points ahead of Kostner in second place. Adelina Sotnikova eggs the crowd on with her hands, just like an NBA player would. She just finished & flowers are raining onto the ice. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Yulia Lipnitskaya found her way to the ice twice and generally unraveled in her long program, hushing the Russian crowd and proving that this would not be the Games remembered for the 15-year-olds. Just to prove the point, Carolina Kostner, a 27-year-old from Italy, followed her onto the ice and captivated the crowd while skating to “Bolero.” No, she does not have the jumping prowess and pure athleticism of kids like Lipnitskaya, but she owns the ice when she’s on it — and she didn’t fall. She scored more than 7 points higher than Lipnitskaya. — LYNN ZINSER Behold the difference between a teen and a woman skating. Italy’s Carolina Kostner just performed with grace, poise, and a veteran’s sensibility. She skated clean, looking like a woman on a mission. She had a smile on her face throughout the performance and seemed like she truly enjoyed it. Kostner, who was third after the short, has a strong chance to become the first Italian woman to win a medal in singles skating. She scores 142.61, for a 216.73, moving into first with season’s bests for the free and total scores. Lipnitskyaya is second, Asada third. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  The Russian breakout star Julia Lipnitskaya kicks off the final group. Even though we’ve seen this program already in the team competition, it’s still stunning. Like a movie you can watch over and over. However, the movie had a bad ending this time, as she looked more like a stressed 15-year-old, falling on the triple salchow, and a wonky landing on another. She is the future, just now wasn’t her time. She moves into first, ahead of Asada, with a 200.57. She scored a 135.34 for the free. She looks really stressed and sad in the kiss-and-cry, hopefully a little time and space – and her gold medal from the team event – will provide some post-Sochi solace. Wrong that a 15-year-old is going to feel like a failure after skating in the final group of her 1st Olympics — Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Here are the final six competitors and the music they have chosen for the most important skate of their lives. Yulia Lipnitskaya of Russia (fifth place after the short program) skates to the score of “Schindler’s List” by the prolific movie composer John Williams. Even if you haven’t heard the score, you’ll be able to guess that’s some pretty heavy-duty seriousness for the 15-year-old Lipnitskaya. Carolina Kostner of Italy (third) chooses “Bolero” by Maurice Ravel. No matter how many great Boleros we see skated for the rest of our lives, none is likely to compare to Torvill and Dean’s famous 1984 ice dancing program that received 12 perfect 6.0’s. Adelina Sotnikova of Russia (second) picks the unheralded “Introduction” and “Rondo Capriccioso” by Camille Saint-Saens. Gracie Gold of the United States (fourth) opts for “Sleeping Beauty” by Tchaikovsky, though not the most famous bit that Disney co-opted into “Once Upon a Dream” for the cartoon. And which composer is the top choice of the top six women at the 2014 Sochi Olympics? Step forward, Camille Saint-Saens. Ashley Wagner of the United States (sixth) skates to music from his opera Samson and Delilah. Great job, Camille! And the final skater, first placed Kim Yu-na of South Korea, goes for the gold to something a little different: “Adios Nonino,” a tango written by the Argentine musician Astor Piazzolla. Good luck to all six. Let’s watch and listen. — VICTOR MATHER The current standings situation evokes the men’s long program last week heading into the final group. Dennis Ten of Kazakhstan was in ninth place after the short program, then came out in the second-to-last group and put down a really strong long program. He sat on top while skater after skater faltered. He ended up with a bronze medal. Asada’s score is very good, and should enough of the skaters in the last group find their way to the ice, she could end up a lot higher than she expects. — LYNN ZINSER Weinzierl is not putting together the points, with too many doubled jumps and too many planned doubles. Got to go with the triple, and a lot of them, or go home. Can’t cheat yourself on points at the Olympics and expect a good finish. Weinzierl scores 147.36 for a total of 151.88, good for 12th place. Wasn’t a great skate. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Polina Edmunds, by stocking her program with difficult jumps and skating with the abandon that only a 15-year-old can muster, announced herself as a contender in the future, but she didn’t put together a strong enough program to move her timeline up to this year. She sits clearly on the youngsters’ side of the divide, as far as the overall strength and maturity of her program. Will be interesting to see what age and experience will add to the mix. — LYNN ZINSER   Mao Asada is one of a handful of women to perform a triple axel in competition. Coming after a disastrous short program performance, she landed the most difficult jump to be attempted in this event, boosting her score. — THE NEW YORK TIMES  The American Paulina Edmunds is doing something not recommended: making the Olympics her first senior international competition. Think about that one. Countries send skaters all over the world to gain experience to be ready for the Olympics. Edmunds is starting off the Big Show. As Mary says, though: “I never looked that relaxed when I was 15. Ever. My theory stands that young skaters are like young skiers. They often have a fearlessness that serves them well. Edmunds is a case in point.” Edmunds fell on her triple flip, but over all a lovely skate for the 15-year-old Californian. She looked calm and confident. Edmunds needs to upgrade to a triple axel, but the future is indeed bright. The 15-yr-old Polina Edmunds is skating now. Such long arms & legs. Looks like a puppy yet to grow into its limbs. She’ll be a star by 2018. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Italy’s Valentina Marchei’s performance is classy, mature and quiet, perhaps a little too quiet. Polite applause when she is done. Last combination was popped a little. One oops: she did not finish on time with the music. She scores 173.33, moves into fourth. Asada still first, Suzuki second and Meite third. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER A striking difference between figure skating on TV and in-person — and this may sound silly — but you really understand how big and lonely that sheet of ice is and how brave these women are. And the sucker punch to the gut when a skater falls is even worse when you’re sharing it with 12,000 other people. — MARY PILON Japan’s Akiko Suzuki is usually outstanding for her lightness on the ice. Her free had some scary moments on jumping passes, getting a little close to the boards. Thankfully, she didn’t crash, but had to append a triple lutz landing to avoid disaster. Mary was just happy that, “I’m hearing the music from ‘Phantom of the Opera,’ and no lighting fixtures fell to the ground.” Suzuki scores 186.32, putting her in second. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  In a sea of girls wearing less-than-distinctive skating dresses and skating to traditional music, Mae Berenice Meite of France stands out and adds a dash of the unique. Not only did she rock an unusual outfit with black tights, she worked ZZ Top into her music. And she skated with fantastic energy. It’s the kind of performance you wish there were more of, just for variety’s sake alone. Meite of France wins the coolest music of the night gold medal. An acoustic, electric-guitar heavy version of We Will Rock You. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER  Holy shades of Surya Bonaly – the skating pants outfit is in the house with Mae Berenice Meite of France. She has black formfitting pants, and a sparkly silver and blue top on. Too bad she fell on the triple loop. At the Palace, Mary says, “I think if you’re from France and the reigning national champ, you can pull that kind of thing off. I’m extremely pro the use of Queen in figure skating. Crowd is clapping along to Meite’s rocking out. If there was a people’s choice award thus far, I think Meite would win it. She connected with the crowd.” Sadly, though, Mary, you do not get extra points for playing air guitar at the Olympics, but credit to Meite for having fun. She recovered nicely from the botched triple loop. Meite moves into second, with a season-best 174.53 total score. Asada still leads at 198.22. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Another strong jumper from China, Li Zijun, kicks off the third group. She was 11th after the short. She’s only 17, and needs to add some emotion and artistry to her skates. This skate never seemed to go anywhere or tell a story. Li scored 181.56 total, and is in fourth place. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER France’s Mae Berenice is wearing a sleeveless sparkly top and black tights. I love the outfit. Go, pants! She looks like a strong rocker. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 A correction to our earlier post. The only pop selection on tonight’s program, for the skate of Mae Berenice Meite of France, will not be a Santana/Queen/ZZ Top medley. It will be a Jean-Pierre Danel/Queen/ZZ Top medley. Haven’t heard of Jean-Pierre Danel? Why not? He won the prestigious Grand Prix Français de la Guitare award in 2007! Other than that delightfully wacky choice, it’s hoary old chestnuts for this third set of skaters: the ballet “Coppelia” (Li Zijun), “Phantom of the Opera” (Akiko Suzuki), “Peer Gynt” (Polina Edmunds) and “Rhapsody in Blue” (Nathalie Weinzierl). The exception is Valentina Marchei of Italy, who has chosen “Nyah.” Not a work with which we were previously familiar. It turns out to be a flamenco from the “Mission: Impossible II” soundtrack. Oh yeah, that’s right: the famous Ving Rhames-Tom Cruise flamenco scene. How did we forget? — VICTOR MATHER Zijun Li (China), Mae Berenice Meite (France), Akiko Suzuki (Japan), Valentina Marchei (Italy), Polina Edmunds (U.S.) and Nathalie Weinzierl (Germany) are waiting for the ice to be prepared. 15-yr-old skating wizard @PolinaEdmunds, hot off a great short program, now warming up. Our story: http://t.co/E6tRShWU7l #Sochi2014 — Mary Pilon (@marypilon) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Mao Asada answered the question as to how she would respond from her terrible short program, and she also struck a blow for experience. It seems as if this field is evenly split between veteran skaters and teenagers making their first leaps into the senior circuit. While the youngsters add bounce to the jumps and don’t seem to tire in the tough minutes of a four-and-a-half-minute program, they don’t add the grace and presence of skaters like Asada and Kim and Carolina Kostner. It has long been the tension in women’s/girls’ skating, over which is more important. As the progress in doing harder and harder jumps has slowed, it seems that experience and grace have become more valued. Poor Mao is weeping after skating a wonderful program. She looked beautiful & free out there. That’s what happens when there’s no pressure. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Asada finally gives a punch of energy to the stands. One Japanese reporter told me before the competition, “I’m only here for Asada.” She’s not used to skating in the first half of the program and her fans are not used to seeing it. — MARY PILON My heart breaks for Mao Asada. She had such high hopes coming into Sochi, wanting to contend for gold. Asada, who was 16th after the short, will not win another Olympic medal — but she won back some measure of self-respect. Her free was what Asada’s fans have come to know: fluid, graceful, soulful, and yes, she killed every jump, including the triple axel. She looked like a two-time world champion. So good, leaving everybody, including Asada, to wonder what might of been if that short program had not been so bad. Happy she is ending her Olympic career on a high note. Asada is crying as she waves to the crowd. She is clearly emotional. And the tears have melted into a smile. She moves into first place, with a 142.71 free score, overall 198.22. She looks happy — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  This group is a window into figure skating’s rise in Asia, with young skaters from Japan and China and South Korea. This is part of a new generation coming up, having followed the path of skaters like Mao Asada, who skates last in this group, and Kim Yu-na, as well as China’s successful pairs skaters from recent Olympics. Japan had high hopes of breaking through in these Olympics, but the short program did not go well for Asada, or Kanako Murakami or Asiko Suzuki. The sense, though, is that they are part of a wave coming up. — LYNN ZINSER China’s Kexin Zhang is known for her jumping. That part is killer. But the artistic touch, especially to the parts of her program that had tango music, was lacking. The tango is a dance of passion, and Zhang seemed stuck on mechanical. Zhang moves into third, scoring a total of 154.21. Mao Asada next, last skater in Group 2. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Japan’s Kanako Murakami, who came into the free in 15th place, is a quiet and graceful skater. But like the rest of the Japanese contingent, this is a disappointing Olympics. Her free was stronger than the short, but it was still marred by under-rotation issues on jumps. Technical review probably getting monitors fired up now. Murakami scores 115.38, for a 170.98 total, to move into first place. That’s 26 points off her season’s best total score. Not her best. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  “Bittersweet Symphony” by the Verve is the in-arena transition music playing right now. Seems like an appropriate choice. — MARY PILON Korea’s second skater, Kim Haejin, has been operating in the long shadow of Kim Yu-na. She took the national titles while Kim Yu-na was on competitive hiatus between Olympics. Kim Haejin fell hard on her triple lutz attempt, sliding into the boards. She recovered, got up, and finished the second half of the program. She bit her lip when the routine was over, as if to say, “Ouch.” Kim moves into second place, scoring a 95.11 for the free, total of 149.48. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Someday, we’ll open a bar called the “Triple Lutz” and the signature cocktails will be the “Layback Spin,” the “Double Axel” and the “Flying Camel Spin.” — MARY PILON The skater from Georgia, Elene Gedevanishvili, did not country shop to get to the Olympics, but she has done a lot of hopping around. She was born in Georgia, but with few rinks there, she and her mother moved to Russia. But Georgia and Russia don’t have the best diplomatic relations, so the two eventually packed up for the United States. After a few hops around, Gedevanishvili is now in Toronto with Brian Orser as her coach. All the movement hasn’t necessarily been a good thing. — LYNN ZINSER Georgia’s Elene Gedevanishvili looked tentative going into her triple lutz, the second jump of her program, and her nerves were right: she fell on the landing. The mistake seemed to take the emotional connection and overall mojo out of her free skate. Gedevanishvili scored 92.45, for 147.15 total, moving her into third place. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Mood in the stands is still tepid, but there are dozens of Kim banners around the arena, as in, ones with her face printed on them, and Russian flags, just itching to be unfurled. Much as the Japanese fans cheered on Yuzuru Hanyu in the men’s singles competition, at times overtaking the Russians on their own turf, expect the South Korean fans to go bonkers in a similar fashion. — MARY PILON  Canada’s Kaetlyn Osmond wins the night’s award (so far) for the most blinged-out outfit. The illusion neckline and back of her crimson-hued dress are covered in large colored stones. Her free-skate theme was Cleopatra, and she went for the drama and sparkle. She tired in the second half of the program, falling on a jumping pass. Big smile from her, amid her gasps for air, at the end. She hasn’t competed much this season because of a foot injury, so her endurance is probably down a bit. Osmond is happy, scoring a season-best 112.80, putting her in first with a total score of 168.98. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER There are two announcers in the arena, one has a tranquil female voice, similar to what New Yorkers hear on the subway. The other, a sinister male voice of darkness that I’ve strangely grown fond of over the days. But when they recite the bios of the skaters (“She likes photography”) it sounds a little like a dating website profile. — MARY PILON Hard to believe Mao Asada, the silver medalist in Vancouver, is in the second group. Her short program was a skating catastrophe, and she ended it in tears. She finished lower than even her two Japanese teammates. Before Wednesday, Asada was still considered Kim Yu-na’s major rival. But when an Olympics rides on a skinny little blade, just about anything can happen. Will be interesting to see if Asada can put aside the short program and skate at her usual level. — LYNN ZINSER Our next group of selections includes music from three very different movies: Kaetlyn Osmond of Canada chooses music from “Asterix & Obelisk: Mission Cleopatre,” which starred Gerard Depardieu, because every French movie stars Gerard Depardieu. The entire history of polyphonic music to choose from, and she picks the score from a sequel to a French slapstick movie? Kim Haejin of South Korea chooses music from “Black Swan.” The entire history of polyphonic music to choose from and she picks the score to an artsy psychosexual horror film? Well, that one we kind of buy. And Kanako Murakami of Japan will skate to “Papa Can You Hear Me?” from the Barbra Streisand musical “Yentl.” This same piece was used in the short program by Nicole Rajicova of Slovakia. Figure skaters apparently love “Yentl”! — VICTOR MATHER Kaetlyn Osmond (Canada), Elene Gedevanishvili (Georgia), Kim Haejin (South Korea), Kanako Murakami (Japan), Kexin Zhang (China) and Mao Asada (Japan) are on the ice. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  Some of the early skaters chose very up-tempo music but didn’t bring along the ability to skate along with it. For the audience, peppy music helps keep the energy up, especially if the skater is subpar, but when the skating on the ice seems to be moving three times slower, the whole thing seems like you’re watching on tape delay. — LYNN ZINSER Slovakia’s Nicole Rajicova’s free skate was kind of flat. These skaters are definitely the undercard for the main event. She looked quite nervous and mechanical at times. The jumps were especially rough. Rajicova ends the first group with an underwhelming 125.00 total. She is in sixth. Daleman leads, Han second, and Park third. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Gjersem was illustrative of what you will see in the first 8-10 skaters of the night: slower speed, less choreography going into jumps, and jumps really telegraphed by the skater going half-way across the sheet to build momentum. The stronger skaters blend the technique, dance, and flow into one seamless package. That’s the jump (no pun intended) from elite to Olympic medalist. Daleman still leads, after four skaters. Gjersem scored 85.98, for a total of 134.54. Goodness gracious, 4 minutes feels like 4 hours when a lower-tier skater is performing the free skate. Does it feel that long for them, too? — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) 20 Feb 14 — JOANNE C. GERSTNER  While Anne Line Gjersem is on the ice, a strange factoid about Norway. The Norwegians are a Winter Olympic powerhouse and are currently leading the medal table. But they have not won a medal in women’s singles since Sonja Henie won gold in 1936. My colleague Lynn Zinser points out, not only has Norway not won a medal, it hasn’t had a competitor in women’s figure skating in 50 years. The last Norwegian who skated in the Olympics was in 1964. — MARY PILON  Elizaveta Ukolova of the Czech Republic has made the first daring non-Johnny Weir fashion statement of the evening, with a sparkly paisley-print sheer overlay on a beige-colored dress. Her skating was not as cool, as she tripped and fell on two jumps. Another junior making the jump to senior level. Ukolova was hit with deductions, scoring 84.55, the lowest score so far for the free. She finishes with a 136.42. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The energy with these first few skaters in the crowd is really flat. The night is young, but still, this is an Olympic final. Incredible how the momentum on the ice changes once a Russian skater appears. They’re not on until the second half. Not to take the attention from the Canadian Daleman, but some of her teammates are engaged in a battle for the women’s curling gold medal not far away at the Ice Cube. Last I checked, they were tied with Sweden! Stone-biter! — MARY PILON This is not new, but a trend that seems to be growing in the Winter Olympics after reaching huge proportions in the Summer Games. Han is the latest example of what appears to be country-shopping for Olympic berths. Han was born in Massachusetts, trains in Connecticut and represents Australia (her father is Australian). In this sport, there isn’t much competition for that Australian Olympic team, but it must be a little odd for Australians to feel some pull to root for a skater who just seems to have borrowed the flag. — LYNN ZINSER  Canada’s Gabrielle Daleman is up, another in a string of teenagers in their first Olympics. She is 16, and is seen as Canada’s future Olympic star. Again, an opening jumping pass revealed nerves, as Daleman put her hands down to save both landings on her triple lutz-triple toe pass. She noticeably slowed in the second half of the program, common for younger skaters at the senior level. Endurance comes with experience. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER New #sochi2014 security concern: a mime has made his way into figure skating, pestering fans…silently. http://t.co/kFesTMqfpj — Mary Pilon (@marypilon) 20 Feb 14 Two skaters, two falls on triple lutz attempts. Brooklee Han of Australia struggled on her lutz, and fell hard on the first pass. Han, who lives and trains in Connecticut, appeared to be a little off on other jump landings too — but still held on. Falling on a jump is an automatic 1-point deduction. So hang on to every jump landing for dear life. Han finishes her first Olympics with a 94.52 for the free, for a 143.84. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER Park of South Korea, the 16-year-old protégé of Kim, fell on both lutz attempts. She looked nervous, a bit stiff in her program. But credit her for a lovely outfit, a shimmering midnight-blue dress with a sky-blue swoosh up the front. She looked pretty. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The presence of Park So-youn in the Olympic free skate raises a question: Is there a wave of talented South Korean figure skaters poised to follow Kim Yu-na into the sport? It is conceivable that Kim could do for skating in her country what Se Ri Pak did for women’s golf. This could even be accelerated because South Korea will host the next Winter Olympics, raising the profile — and the stakes — even more. Kim would be known as the Queen for more than just her on-ice performances. — LYNN ZINSER Keeping with Sochi tradition, it’s starting time at the Iceberg Skating Palace, and the arena is barely two-thirds full. By the first pass of the ice-resurfacing machine, it is likely to be packed, but there is a consistent lack of interest from fans in the first batch of skaters. It must be really difficult to be a skater from South Korea who is not Kim Yu-na. — MARY PILON  Park So-Youn of South Korea will skate to “Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini” by Rachmaninoff. If you’re not a classical music buff but you still recognize the haunting melody, that’s because it has been used in dozens of romantic movies over the years, notably “Somewhere in Time.” Gabrielle Daleman of Canada will skate to the Polovetsian Dances from the opera “Prince Igor.” If you are not an opera buff but still recognize the haunting melody … that’s because it’s also “Stranger in Paradise” from the musical “Kismet,” as recorded by Tony Bennett, Bing Crosby and others. Nicole Rajicova of Slovakia skates to “Tango Amore” by Edvin Marton, You won’t recognize this one, but did you know that Edvin Marton is a Ukrainian composer who wrote the winning song at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest and is known as the violinist of the skaters? — VICTOR MATHER Park So-youn (Korea), Brooklee Han (Australia), Gabrielle Daleman (Canada), Elizaveta Ukolova (Czech Republic), Anne Line Gjersem (Norway) and Nicole Rajicova (Slovakia). — JOANNE C. GERSTNER The NBCSN commentators Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski have hauled out major fashion for the free skate. It looks like they have coordinated their outfits: gold headbands and gold jewelry. Lipinski has a gold blouse on, while Weir has gone with a white shirt and black jacket. Très chic. — JOANNE C. GERSTNER In addition to analyzing every salchow and toe loop, we’ll also be filling you in on the musical selections the women have chosen tonight. The short program featured a wide range of musical genres, including Sondheim, the Rolling Stones, Prince, Pink Floyd and Queen. The skaters are playing it much safer in tonight’s long program. Of the 24 women on the ice, 11 have chosen classical pieces, including some chestnuts you’ve heard at many skating events. Seven have opted for that other classic skating genre: movie scores. Four have chosen traditional dance music (mostly tangos), and there will be two Broadway songs and just one a pop selection. But that pop selection promises to be a doozy: a Santana, Queen, ZZ Top medley! — VICTOR MATHER Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Travel   Sardinian Food and History, Via Bike. Advertisement Ciclismo Classico has enlisted the skills of a James Beard Award-winning chef (and former competitor on Bravo’s “Top Chef Masters”) to entice tourists into a culinary-focused bike tour through Sardinia. The tour will be a combination of eating and exercise, with the Boston chef Jody Adams as host. Ms. Adams, owner of the restaurants Rialto and Trade and an avid bicyclist who has pedaled across the state of Massachusetts on several occasions, will guide this seven-day, almost 200-mile cycle trip through the Mediterranean island, stopping to taste local wines and cuisine. Riders will begin in Tresnuraghes, in the west, continuing along the coast to the Sinis peninsula and Cabras, then will turn southeast to end in Pula at the island’s southern tip. “I realized that riding was a great way to see the world,” Ms. Adams, who has led several other bike tours through Italy, told The Boston Globe. “It’s a wonderful way to be in the world as you move through life. It makes you feel powerful.” Rialto typically offers a rotating menu of regional Italian foods, with Sardinian cuisine often featured in the summer months. Riders on the tour obviously will be stopping for a few samples along the way, from vineyards, olive groves, markets and local restaurants. But they will also visit some of the island’s historic sites, like mining towns, ancient Phoenician and Roman settlements and archaeological dig sites. The first trip runs Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, at a starting rate of $5,395. A second new tour this year turns to Belgian beer for inspiration. Though neither bike tours nor beer-drinking are revolutionary in the country (it produces more than a thousand different beers each year and biking is the national sport, after all), this trip focuses on boutique establishments like the Brasserie d’Orval, one of the last remaining breweries of the Trappist monks. The nine-day tour mixes in a little history as well, with stops in the hills of Ardennes, where the Battle of the Bulge took place, as well as in Luxembourg, Flanders and Bruges. The tour runs once a month in June, July and August, starting at a rate of $4,495.

The Irish-English artist Leonora Carrington (1917-2011) elbowed herself into the Surrealist movement in quite realistic fashion: She ran off to Paris with Max Ernst. Her dalliance with her fellow Surrealist aside, though, Carrington had the goods. CreditPatricia Wall/The New York Times 1 of 10 New books include “Love Always Everywhere” and “There’s This Thing.” By DANA JENNINGS FEB. 20, 2014 We do obsess about the weather. We gab and gossip about it, inhale it via the Weather Channel, brood on it out the kitchen window over morning coffee. The old radio farm reports had it right: Give ’em the weather and the wheat prices, and you got ’em hooked. In much the same way that we can’t resist the external weather, the very best artists summon interior weathers that mesmerize us, psychic precip and visceral barometric pressures that move us. Think about Bob Dylan’s cryptic winds and Johnny Cash’s dark thunder, Emily Dickinson’s attic squalls and Billy Collins’s amused zephyrs, van Gogh’s anguished gusts and Pollock’s furious typhoons. The five artists in the books here pass the weather test. The qualities of heat and light — of profound interior weathers — in their works are gripping, and sometimes haunting.  
Business   Bad Egg. Advertisement By Evan Birnholz Feb 22, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Something wicked this way comes. There’s a nefarious element to today’s puzzle with entries like BLACK MAGIC, PIRATE SHIP, and METH, to name a few. It’s the calling card of our constructor, Evan Birnholz, who has a knack for whipping up puzzles with a more devious bent. There’s a BAD EGG or two to be found among those people mentioned in today’s clues and answers. Early on we see Johnny Cash’s infamous lyric “I SHOT a man in Reno” from “Folsom Prison Blues,” and then a few entries later we come across OMAR Little, the shotgun-wielding Robin Hood figure from the TV show “The Wire” whose lethal tendencies will make you want to STAY AT HOME. But fear not, because the puzzle isn’t all bad guys and things that go bump in the night. We also come across ARCHANGELS and a good SAMARITAN. Let’s hear a bit more about Evan’s creative process: I’d like to take a second to plug my brand-new, independent crossword website Devil Cross. I release a new puzzle every other Saturday and though I ran one last week, I decided to drop a new one on Friday, and it’s a contest puzzle! (Fair warning: Devil Cross puzzles may contain some R-rated language that you won’t see in a Times puzzle) I wrote this puzzle in March 2013 and it was just my fourth attempt at a themeless grid. At the time I hadn’t been having much success with themed puzzles, so I turned to themeless construction. Now, I enjoy creating themeless grids the most since they give you the freedom to experiment with fresh, fun phrases in a way that themed puzzles don’t. DOMINATRIX was my seed entry and I built upward. I like many of the long phrases I got in there, but this puzzle shows my impatience to submit it since it has more short, less-than-stellar entries than I would normally prefer today (things like RESOW, AREAR, SALMI, DE ORO, I SHOT and SNEE). If I could rework the grid now I might try putting DOMINATRIX in a different position just to see if the fill would be cleaner. It’s probably a little strange seeing her on the bottom rather than on top, no? The gentleman whose puzzle will appear in tomorrow’s Sunday Times (Victor Fleming) was my mentor on themeless construction. He was critical of my first couple of attempts, but his criticism ended up helping me a lot. It gave me the focus to keep striving to create the best grid possible. So while I have my own qualms about this puzzle, I still think it’s good, and my themeless grids have gotten progressively better since I made it.

Foreign   Emulating a Model Communist Through Cosmetic Surgery. Advertisement For the poor, the homeless, people down on their luck in the central province of Anhui, Zhang Yidong has often been there to help. He has made a career of raising money and public interest to help the downtrodden. He has also made something of a name for himself in the process, so much so that Chinese media outlets call him a “public welfare celebrity.” He is often compared to Lei Feng, the young People’s Liberation Army soldier trumpeted as a Communist Party icon for his unstinting devotion to his comrades. Mr. Zhang says he considers Lei Feng, the so-called rustless screw of Mao’s revolution, to be a role model. And now he has taken his emulation to the next step. This week he began a series of cosmetic procedures as part of an effort to look like Lei Feng. “No matter how open or developed China becomes, we can’t forget the Lei Feng spirit,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview. “Through this activity I want to tell even more people that to study Lei Feng, we can’t just engage in slogans.” Mr. Zhang says that by changing his appearance he hopes to raise public awareness of Lei Feng, whose fame saw a mild resurgence two years ago thanks to a vigorous propaganda push tied to the 50th anniversary of his death. Lei Feng, who died at the age of 22 in 1962 when he was hit by a falling telephone pole, is known in China as a symbol of selflessness and devotion to the cause of communism. He sewed quilts and darned socks for his fellow soldiers, assiduously studied Mao’s writings at night by flashlight and collected weighty loads of cow dung for fertilizer. Those exploits and most of his biography itself have come under close scrutiny in recent years by scholars and average Chinese alike who point to the suspect signs of propaganda: well-lit photos of a supposedly average soldier, a detailed diary full of expressions of loyalty and an all-too-well-honed image. Like Lei Feng, Mr. Zhang has at times found his record under question. Last year he participated in an event with Chen Guangbiao, a recycling tycoon and philanthropist known for brazen acts of self-publicity. Mr. Chen wanted to award 800,000 renminbi, about $130,000, to Mr. Zhang to help carry out his charitable work. Mr. Zhang declined, and online many people suggested the exchange was merely a ruse to help boost both men’s profiles. Mr. Zhang says he welcomes the scrutiny, and argues that serving the public interest requires a certain amount of bombast. “I think criticism is good,” he said. “It shows people are paying attention.” Mr. Zhang’s makeover, which is being provided free of cost by a hospital in the city of Hefei, began on Thursday with a series of injections of the dermal filler Restylane. The goal of the process is one that many who visit a plastic surgeon can identify with. “It involves some skin rejuvenation and microsurgery to help my face look like Lei Feng’s,” said Mr. Zhang, who at 32 is 10 years older than his hero at the time of his death. “Lei Feng, he was very young.” Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world.

Science   Better Than a Credit Card. Advertisement Every time we read or hear about older adults victimized by scams on the phone, scams on the street, thefts in senior residences or attacks via the Internet, we wince. And we think: Is there no way to protect aging parents from such predators, short of taking charge of their finances? Law enforcement has trouble keeping up with these fast-moving thieves, who have often moved onto the next scheme by the time the police and regulators have warned about the current one. And warnings won’t help some potential victims anyway: Poor financial decisions often constitute an early warning sign of cognitive loss, researchers have warned. Yet after decades of adequately handling their own money, older people understandably resist ceding control. Can’t we leave them some autonomy — the ability to support a favorite charity or carry some walking-around money or buy a new purse — without the risk that they may impoverish themselves? A thought: The use of prepaid debit cards as a substitute for credit cards and checking accounts has grown enormously in the past few years. A Pew Charitable Trusts survey earlier this month reported that 5 percent of American adults use them at least monthly and that the amount of money loaded onto them — $65 billion in 2012 — has more than doubled over three years. Few card users were over age 65, Pew found — just 5 percent. But maybe more of them could or should be.  Lots of banks, stores and online sources offer prepaid cards, which function much like debit or credit cards but are not linked to bank accounts. You can load and reload them with cash, via direct deposit, or in some cases with transfers or checks deposited at ATMs. People then use them, with either PINs or signatures, to get cash and to shop in person or online. Relying on these cards makes it a lot harder to wipe out an I.R.A. or hand a grifter $10,000. “Prepaid cards can be a useful tool for monitoring and controlling the spending of others,” Christina Tetreault, a staff attorney at Consumers Union, told me. “You can’t spend more money than has been loaded on the card, and that can be very attractive.” In fact, one fledgling company considers older adults such a promising market that it is about to offer a prepaid Visa card, called True Link, specifically intended for seniors. Highly customizable, it will permit the administrator (a trusted family member) to set per-purchase or per-day spending limits or cap A.T.M. withdrawals. It can block charges to individual merchants or charities or whole categories, like magazine subscriptions. You could block only your mother’s phone purchases, for instance. “She can go to the movies, grocery shopping or out to dinner, and the card works like any debit card,” said James Tinsley, director of marketing and communications at True Link. “But if she’s watching late-night television and decides to order four crock pots, the card gets declined.” You could authorize card use at the corner Rite Aid but not the one across town, where she never goes. And you can receive text alerts if someone uses the card to make A.T.M. withdrawals at 2 a.m. Prepaid cards can entail some risks, for seniors or for anyone. Consumer advocates caution that they lack the federally mandated protections that apply to credit and debit cards. The funds loaded on prepaid cards need not be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for instance, though many issuers provide F.D.I.C. insurance voluntarily. Some offer the same loss and theft safeguards as debit or credit cards; others don’t. A few allow overdrafts, defeating the whole idea of controlling spending. “I encourage consumers to really read the fine print on these,” said Maggie Flowers, senior program manager at the National Council on Aging. “All of them have different rules and fees.” The fees can mount, too. The best cards — Consumer Reports gives high marks to Bluebird (an American Express/Walmart product) and Green Dot — set low monthly charges that often can be waived, with few other costs. But other cards require fees when you set them up, when you reload or use an A.T.M., even when you don’t use them frequently. “Some are very transparent, and others you have to hunt for the information — and even then it’s not clear,” Ms. Tetreault said.  Consumer Union has published tips for users; so has the National Council on Aging. Clearly, a prepaid card won’t work for every older person confused about money. Perhaps the cardholder can’t remember his PIN or loses the card so regularly it serves little purpose. But large numbers of seniors can use, and misuse, checking accounts and debit and credit cards, which sometimes leads them into trouble. At least a prepaid card could limit their losses — not only from scamsters, but from pushy marketers, overzealous investment counselors or because of their own ill-advised spending. Theoretically, anyway. If you have used a prepaid card to help an older relative maintain independence and solvency, we would like to hear how it has gone in the comments.

Sports   Highlights and Analysis: Canada Defeats United States in Men’s Hockey Semifinal. Advertisement Canada defeated the United States, 1-0, in the semifinals of the men’s hockey tournament to advance to the gold medal game. In a rematch of the 2010 gold medal game, Canada dominated play for much of the game, going ahead on a goal by the Dallas Stars’ Jamie Benn early in the second period. American goalie Jonathan Quick kept his team in the game, withstanding a near-constant Canadian barrage to make 36 saves. But the United States, which had been the highest-scoring team in the tournament, could not get the equalizer. Canada will play Sweden in the gold medal game Sunday. Canada and Sweden have won three of the past four gold medals in men’s hockey since N.H.L. players became part of the tournament in 1998, Canada in 2002 and 2010 and Sweden in 2006. Continue reading to see how it all happened in real time. The loss to Canada, which was resounding despite the close score, will bring up some questions about the assembly of the U.S. team. Obviously the team needed scoring — and not just in a shootout — so Bobby Ryan’s absence stands out. But the defense had issues too and they can’t all be traced to Paul Martin’s injury. Aside from Kevin Shattenkirk, there wasn’t another offensive defenseman in the bunch. Was Brooks Orpik really a better choice than Erik Johnson, who was so good in the 2010 Games? Wouldn’t Keith Yandle or Dustin Byfuglien have come in handy when they needed to sustain some offense and score a goal? Just some food for thought as the Americans contemplate what might have been. — LYNN ZINSER It became clear in this game that Canada was a far stronger team than the U.S. and it earned itself a gold medal game against Sweden. That game should be more evenly matched, with Sweden showing defensive strength to rival Canada’s. The U.S. will try for a bronze medal against Finland, which would be a bitter consolation prize, but a prize nonetheless. It will leave with the great memory of the shootout victory over Russia. Canada, though, was a much bigger hurdle to overcome. Perhaps the U.S. men’s and women’s teams should get together for a group cry. — LYNN ZINSER The desperate U.S. rush at the end produced only more desperation. Perhaps fittingly, the clock ran out with the players digging in the corner for the puck. This game was 1-0, but it felt like a blowout by Canada, with the U.S. getting so few chances to make this a game. — LYNN ZINSER For one last push at a tying goal. The U.S. is trying to mount a comeback, but when they get in the offensive zone, Canada’s defensemen and forwards succeed in keeping the play along the boards and the shots from far away. They can manage nothing in the middle and no traffic in front of Price. It’s like there is a force field holding them out. — LYNN ZINSER  This one was on Chris Kunitz, who was alone next to Quick at the left of the goal with the puck on his backhand. Quick slid to stuff the shot in spectacular fashion, keeping this a one-goal game. — LYNN ZINSER Ryan Callahan threw himself in front of a huge slap shot by Drew Doughty, part of a very gutsy and successful penalty kill by the U.S. That bullet dodged, the U.S. has only 7 minutes to figure out how to get a goal of its own. — LYNN ZINSER Kessel is off for hooking and the Canadians get a power play chance. Their offense has looked like it is on a power play even when it isn’t. — LYNN ZINSER such a pleasure to watch Jonathan Quick Play goal — Jim Craig (@JimCraigUSA) 21 Feb 14 On a rush accelerated by Kessel, Parise got a good shot on Price from the slot, but Price has been up for whatever the Americans can throw at him. And he has given up so few rebounds to cut down the U.S. chances. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. team seems to be chasing everything right now. Its offensive rushes are stymied after one shot and then they are back trailing Canada down the ice. Their kingdom for an extended stretch in the Canadian zone. Plus, Quick could use the rest. — LYNN ZINSER Team USA preliminary-round hero T.J. Oshie hasn’t been much of a factor in this game — but I guess, hey, it’s not the shootout yet — but he just got a shot on Carey Price. Not a great one, but at this point, any shot is a good shot. The U.S. needs a lucky bounce to turn things around. — LYNN ZINSER Forget trying to call anyone in Canada now. http://t.co/YBokwOvUf5 — Rod Gilbert (@rodgilbert7) 21 Feb 14 On paper, the U.S. is playing this game much more evenly. Canada only led in shots in the second period by one, 12-11. Watching the game paints an entirely different picture. Many of the U.S. shots were easy for Carey Price to handle. The Americans are hoping for a late reversal like in 2010, when it took a late goal by Parise to even force overtime in that gold medal game. To do that, they are going to have to find a little more spunk for the spunky underdog role. — LYNN ZINSER Remember that tremendous glove save Jonathan Quick made on Jamie Benn late in the second period? It might turn out to be fairly important, but it was so very Quick-ian, as he came far out of his net to confront Benn, then sprawled on the ice to stop the puck. Quick’s aggressive style can be panic-inducing, but he is the reason the Americans are down only one goal. Since he was a backup goalie for the U.S. team in Vancouver, Quick, 28, has won a Stanley Cup with the Los Angeles Kings and been one of the best goalies in the N.H.L. But this season has been rocky. Quick, who is from Connecticut, struggled at the beginning of the season, then was sidelined from mid-November to the end of December with a groin injury. But in Sochi, his play is reminiscent of his playoff performances for the Kings. — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Jonathan Quick 0, Canada 1 after 2 periods. — LA Kings (@LAKings) 21 Feb 14 Considering how much steam Canada was gaining in that period, the U.S. should feel lucky to be trailing by only one goal. The momentum of this game clearly shifted as Canada scored and the team’s overall depth and superior defense began to make the going much tougher for the U.S. attack. The American coaches are going to spend this intermission figuring out how to tighten up its own defense — a challenge made stiffer by the absence of Paul Martin — and spring Phil Kessel and Patrick Kane free for more chances. This hockey game could use a bit of the intensity and disdain that the women brought last night. Still feels a bit…polite. — NYT Olympics (@SochiNYT) 21 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER The American power play managed three shots, none of them really dangerous, and Canada killed off another penalty. The U.S. offense did stay on the offensive and got a post-power play scrum going in front of the net after a shot by Paul Stastny slid just wide. The longer the U.S. goes without a goal, though, the more doubt creeps in. — LYNN ZINSER Chris Kunitz takes a bad penalty in front of the U.S. net, giving the Americans a chance to get a foothold in this game. Of course, Canada had the first scoring chance on a shorthanded rush. What you miss during TV timeouts: The 12-man cleaning crew. Some scrape, some shovel, some wash windows. Then gone. Poof. — NYT Olympics (@SochiNYT) 21 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Canada’s defenseman haven’t made any flashy plays, but they are by and large keeping the play in front of them and supporting every rush. The latest scoring chance produced out of this came from Benn, and Quick had to sprawl to keep the puck out of the American net. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. got another scoring rush from Kane (who did so by wheeling around his Chicago teammate Jonathan Toews), but then it immediately turned into another burst of offense by Canada, who unfurled a handful of shots on Quick. The U.S. defenseman are spending a lot of time on their heels, getting the worst of these matchups. It’ll be a something of a miracle if the US gets out of this period allowing only one goal. — Naila-Jean Meyers (@NailaJeanMeyers) 21 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Jamie Benn, the goal scorer for Canada, was not on the preliminary roster released by Team Canada this summer. He considered it something of a snub, but he played his way on to the national team. He has 22 goals and 29 assists in 58 games for the Dallas Stars. Benn, a 24-year-old from British Columbia, is only 12 points short of his career high already. This was his second goal of the tournament, joining Jeff Carter as the only Canadian forwards with more than one goal. — NAILA-JEAN The U.S. power play kept possession this time, which made it more dangerous, but mostly stood around in the Canadian zone, which did not make for many dynamic scoring chances. Patrick Kane let go of one blast that created the proper chaos in front of the net, but aside from that, there was not much happening. Chalk that up as another mini-victory for Canada. — LYNN ZINSER Ryan Getzlaf is called for high sticking and the U.S. gets a chance at a power play. It didn’t get a single shot on the last one, though, so they are already ahead of the game with a quick one here. A goal, however, would be better for them. — LYNN ZINSER Benn’s deflection, with Corey Perry screening Quick, was just what the Canadian doctor ordered. That gave them a jolt of confidence and you can see Quick’s shoulders slump. Let’s see if the confidence swing changes the way this game is played. A little life in the arena. U-S-A chants get drowned out by CAN-A-DA chant. Dissolves into usual chaos. PA system takes over. — NYT Olympics (@SochiNYT) 21 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Jamie Benn, relatively quiet up until now, had the perfectly timed deflection of a shot by defenseman Jay Bouwmeester to redirect the puck past Jonathan Quick for a 1-0 lead for Canada. — LYNN ZINSER Patrice Bergeron led the Canadians with four shots on goal in the first period. Patrick Sharp had three. Zach Parise led the Americans with four shots. — LYNN ZINSER Just because this game is 0-0 doesn’t mean it has been dull. The fast pace was just as expected, with long passes stretching the ice and the speediest players creating the most havoc. Canada had the edge in shots, 16-11, and the teams traded stretches of dominating the puck. U.S. goalie Jonathan Quick made the more spectacular saves, although Price stood tall when he needed to, keeping the U.S. off the board when it was grabbing the momentum early. — LYNN ZINSER After one early scoring chance, this power play went south quickly for the U.S. It iced the puck, which was ridiculous, and then Canada got control and managed a scoring chance of its own shorthanded. The U.S. wasn’t able to set up in the offensive zone again and the power play time dwindled down to nothing. The U.S. defensemen were not strong keeping the puck in at the blue line. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. gets its first power play when San Jose Sharks teammates Patrick Marleau and Joe Pavelski collided. It’s interference on Canada’s Marleau. Two minutes of power play for the Americans. — LYNN ZINSER Canada used that power play to turn the action its way, and Quick has had to fend off a flurry of scoring chances here. His side to side quickness really coming in handy here, especially on rebounds. Quick has not been playing his best this N.H.L. season, but he has looked sharp in the Olympics. — LYNN ZINSER Defenseman Ryan Suter, just out of the penalty box, is by far the American leader in ice time. Coming into the game, he had been on the ice more than 10 minutes longer than the next highest American, Ryan McDonagh. He also leads the N.H.L. in ice time at 29:49 per game, more than two minutes more than the next player on the list. (And because we can’t write about the U.S. team without talking about the Miracle on Ice, Suter’s dad, Bob, was a defenseman on the 1980 American team.) — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Quick gave up a big rebound and had to slide across his crease to make a second save to keep this game scoreless. The U.S. survived that first test. — LYNN ZINSER Canada gets the first power play, having turned a U.S. scoring chance into a rush of its own led by Jeff Carter. U.S. defenseman Ryan Suter reached out to stop him, so now the first power play. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. has had by far the better jump here, which is good if you’re rooting for the south-of-the-border guys, but if they don’t turn it into a goal, it starts to become an advantage for Canada. If Canada weathers what feels like a storm, it gains confidence that it can take the best the U.S. can throw its way. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. has dominated this stretch, using puck possession to keep Canada bottled in its zone. Its shots, though, are coming from defensemen with a lot of bodies to get through. Traffic in front of the net is good, but it can also make for a lot of off-target deflections too. — LYNN ZINSER Another Kessel rush gets the Americans surging into the Canada zone and John Carlson unleashes one of his big shots for the best U.S. scoring chance yet. But Price stops it. — LYNN ZINSER If you keep score of such things, the St. Louis Blues are the most represented team on the ice, with 3 Americans and 2 Canadians. — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS As Jeff Carter springs a rush by using his speed to surge up the middle of the ice, it’s another reminder — as if we needed one — that the big ice puts an even bigger premium on speed. Defense turns into offense quickly in Olympic games, with quick passes turning into breakaways and odd-man rushes. This is where Canada has the edge on defense, because it’s defensemen are — overall — faster skaters. — LYNN ZINSER U.S. goalie Jonathan Quick faced his first shots, and held tough, but he had a lot of company on the ice from his Los Angeles Kings teammates. American teammate Dustin Brown was on the ice and the second shot came from defenseman Drew Doughty. — LYNN ZINSER The U.S. team gets the first shot of the game with Phil Kessel streaking toward the goal after getting past Duncan Keith, and Carey Price was up to the task. Expect the speediest players, Kessel included, to push the pace here. — LYNN ZINSER On the American side, the forward mysteriously missing from the goal scoring column in Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks. But he has had several great chances and is distributing the puck brilliantly, collecting four assists. Kane, who is fifth in the N.H.L. in points with 63, will be facing three Chicago teammates today: forwards Jonathan Toews and Patrick Sharp and defenseman Duncan Keith — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Hockey reporters in the arena have reported spotting Russian forward Alex Ovechkin in the stands to watch this game. A late-arriving crowd for hockey. About half full. Pessimists might say half empty, but pretty sure it’ll fill up in the next 4 minutes. — NYT Olympics (@SochiNYT) 21 Feb 14 — LYNN ZINSER Some possibly relevant statistics. Sidney Crosby does not yet have a goal in the Olympics as Mike Babcock has struggled to find the right linemates for him. Canada’s offense has, in fact, been carried by its defense, which has scored 7 of its 13 goals. Drew Doughty has 4 goals and Shea Weber 3. But Crosby was relatively quiet in elimination games in Vancouver too and ended up scoring the biggest goal of all: the game-winner in overtime in the gold medal game against the United States. “I’m playing and reacting, trusting that it’s going to go in, and sometimes it feels like it’s not going in very easily,” Crosby said this week. “But usually it takes one, and they all start going in.” — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Expect a much more freewheeling, hard-hitting game between the U.S. and Canada than you saw in the first semifinal between Sweden and Finland. It’s not that those two rivals took it easy on each other, but their strengths are a more tactical game and they each played to their personalities, trying to use their speed in bursts and otherwise control the puck. The U.S. and Canada favor a more N.H.L.-style game, and add in the fact that they just don’t like each other. They will hit and skate and take a lot of chances. Should be fun to watch. — LYNN ZINSER It is, in fact, a hand injury that is keeping Paul Martin out of the lineup, not an illness. It’s another disappointing injury for Martin. He missed several weeks of the N.H.L. season with a broken leg, jeopardizing his spot on the Olympic team. He also missed the Vancouver Olympics in 2010 when a broken arm didn’t heal in time. — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS This semifinal, like the first one, pits neighboring countries that know each other well and have developed a sporting distaste for each other, and NBC is anticipating a large audience, including for its live Internet stream. That loss in the gold medal game at the Vancouver Games has rankled the American players for four years. These Olympics, however, have afforded them a fresh start. In Sochi, the United States team grabbed attention with its shootout victory over Russia in the preliminary round, but that was its only close game. It has outscored four opponents, 20-6. The team received a dose of bad news Friday morning. Defenseman Paul Martin is ill and will not be able to play. Canada’s bad news came Thursday, with forward John Tavares tearing an anterior cruciate ligament, which will also end his N.H.L. season with the Islanders. Canada has played much closer games in this tournament, needing a late goal to beat Latvia in the quarterfinals. It has outscored its four opponents, 13-3. — LYNN ZINSER With defenseman Paul Martin out of the lineup (either because of illness or injury), the spotlight will fall on John Carlson. He will move up in the lineup to play with Martin’s partner and Penguins teammate Brooks Orpik. Carlson, 24, scored the first goal of the Olympics for the American team in its 7-1 victory over Slovakia. He added an assist and has a plus-2 rating for the tournament. But his playing time has been erratic because he has been the team’s seventh defenseman for the past three games. Carlson played less than four minutes against Russia, when American Coach Dan Bylsma relied heavily on his top defensive pairing of Ryan Suter and Ryan McDonagh. Carlson also had the least ice time among defensemen against the Czech Republic in the quarterfinals. A first-time Olympian, Carlson grew up in New Jersey and plays for the Washington Capitals. He has 10 goals and 13 assists this season, his fourth full season in the N.H.L. He was a first-round draft pick by Washington, the 27th pick over all, in 2008.

Advertisement From February to April, more than half a million sandhill cranes and millions of waterfowl will make their way to central Nebraska as a part of their yearly migration north. Beginning the first week of March, Audubon Nebraska’s Rowe Sanctuary will open viewing blinds in several locations along the Platte River, where enthusiasts can view the birds in their natural habitat. The cranes roost on the river’s sandbars and gorge themselves in surrounding fields in preparation for flights to nesting grounds as far away as Siberia. “It’s pretty fascinating, because they seldom hold still,” said Chris Thody, coordinator for Audubon’s Nebraska Crane Festival in Kearney, Neb. “And the noise they make is awe-inspiring. Imagine tens of thousands of cranes trilling; it’s an incredible sound.” In addition, starting March 20, when the concentration of birds peaks, the festival will offer three days of special events, including field trips, workshops, and guest speakers. Registration costs $125, and a portion of the proceeds will be used to preserve sandhill crane habitat. “The preservation of habitat is the utmost reason for this festival,” Ms. Thody said. “Sandhill cranes are one of the oldest bird species, and they have been coming to Nebraska since before the Platte River existed, but preserving this land for them also helps a plethora of other endangered and threatened species, like whooping cranes, interior least terns and piping plovers.” Those who can’t make the festival can still observe the cranes from their homes, using the online CraneCam.

Business   Opening the Corporation. Advertisement   In particular, the information-sharing habits of open source software seem to be becoming a standard in other parts of business. Much the way the Linux operating system came to dominate computer servers, and the Apache web server became critical to the Internet, companies seem to be discovering that they can move faster and create more change by exposing things that once stayed secret to a larger population. Soon they may even share information among competitors. Tidemark, a company that makes cloud-based software for looking at a company’s financial performance, says it now sees lots of data being shared across companies, and may soon build services for cross-company sharing. “Even sharing between departments, like finance and human resources showing data, is a cultural change,” said Christian Gheorghe, Tidemark’s founder and chief executive. “Like open source, one person might be able to make a fix, but there is a collective power in collaborating and knowing the group history.” In a product release this April, Mr. Gheorghe plans to incorporate the ability for a company to anonymously share information with others in its industry like how long it takes to hire a new employee. The idea is to build open industry benchmarks, against which people can measure their company, over time possibly improving the overall average. Another company, Skyhigh Networks, this week released what it hopes will be a standard method of scoring whether a mobile application is safe to use in a corporate setting. Of 5,000 cloud services Skyhigh examined, about 9 percent were seen as risky. Instead of objecting or protesting, all the companies among that 9 percent sought to meet the common standard. “Benchmarking among providers is a kind of low-hanging fruit” for information management in the cloud, said Rajiv Gupta, Skyhigh’s co-founder and chief executive. “Banks are already sharing all their threat information on cybercrime. People will want to know how they compare and how they can improve on all sorts of things.” Tech companies in particular – but what companies aren’t tech-influenced at this point? – are eager to make data move faster, including information on how workers are trained. Slack, a communications service, recently announced a real-time product for businesses that works something like a chat service, but also allows formation of groups and document sharing. The real service, however, may be the product’s effect on awareness, by opening up information. “When we hire a person, we tell them, ‘Read the last two weeks of communication,’” said Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s founder. “They don’t just see communications, they see who is good at answering which questions, and how people talk with each other. You triangulate how the company actually functions.” Considering how much effort companies spend on building corporate culture, that is no small thing. But should everything be shared? “You can create a private group for discussions about things like hiring or pay, but we encourage putting out as much information as possible,” Mr. Butterfield said. “Even if you know the official structure of a company, you don’t really know how things get done.” There are many other companies that have grown up in cloud businesses, which have a more open approach to information sharing. GitHub, a popular method of writing software, envisions a day when legal documents and other work is shared within companies and possibly externally. Asana, which was co-founded by one of the founders of Facebook, thinks its project management software could save the world 5 percent of its effort on pretty much everything. If that sounds presumptuous, so be it. So did taking apart the computer industry by having everyone work for free. Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   1964: U.S. TV Corps Grapples with Cops, Alps and Lingo. Advertisement   A technician working for the American Broadcasting Co. here was pinched yesterday when he tried to drive past one of the barriers the police seem to enjoy putting up around town. He pleaded innocence and ignorance for several minutes, but the Austrian gendarme took him by the arm and started to drag him off to the sneezer. In a desperation move, the technician grabbed his transistor walkie-talkie and screamed into the mouthpiece: “Mayday-Mayday! They’re taking me to jail…” Besides the cops, ABC has had to contend with the Alps, which are steep, plane schedules, which are erratic, and the Innsbruck telephone system, which is rustic. Prodigious Task Camera men are not notably agile types to begin with, and clambering up the Alps with their cumbersome equipment would be a challenge for Sir Edmund Hillary. Their task is prodigious. With a crew of 110, more than half European, they are taping every event in this barrel-slave carnival for a total of 17 and a half hours of prime-time broadcasting in the U.S. To do the job they are equipped with 50 cameras, staffs from half a dozen European television networks, five helicopters, several mobile units, innumerable rented cars and station wagons and $1,500,000. It is not all for the greater glory of snow. The sponsors also hope they will peddle a great deal of beer, cigarettes, automobile tires, insurance and hand lotion. Because It’s There The logistics of the Olympics here are difficult for the spectators, but the problem is multiplied for the television men. Camera men are not notably agile types to begin with, and clambering up the Alps with their cumbersome equipment would be a challenge for Sir Edmund Hillary. The helicopters have done much of the work by depositing cameras and paraphernalia on the mountaintops. Roone Arledge, the commander-in-chief of the ABC adventure, got some notion of the trouble that was ahead of him when he first sat down with the head of the organizing committee almost a year ago. Before he began to list the networks’ needs to the chairman, Prof. Friedl Wolfgang, Arledge asked the Austrian if he would like an interpreter. The professor declined, insisting that his English was up to the chore of listing the technical requirements for televising the games. When they had finished, the professor assured Arledge he had understood every word and said: “But the hour grows late and the time has come for me to say hello.” — New York Herald Tribune, Feb. 1, 1964.

Travel   Chicken Soup for Flu-Weary Guests. Advertisement With flu season at its peak in the United States, some hotels, especially in New York City, are trying to help guests ward off the illness or at least make it easier to manage. The Kitano in Midtown Manhattan has a new immune-system-boosting menu with ingredients like ginger and plum paste in dishes like steamed egg custard with crab meat. The Hotel Chandler in the Murray Hill neighborhood has a “Flu Away” package through the end of March — a room with a pamphlet that has tips on staying healthy and a Vicks GermFree humidifier. Prices start at $250 a night. At the Towers of the Waldorf-Astoria, guests are appointed a concierge who can go pharmacy shopping and deliver flu-fighting teas to the room. At the Chatwal, guests can get beet-green apple celery flu-fighting juice through room service and also request flu shots in the rooms from a nearby pharmacist or doctor. House calls start at $300. The Sanctuary in Kiawah Island, S.C., offers a eucalyptus-scented steam room and heated wraps to help with achy muscles in its spa, and also chicken soup that can be sent to the room. The Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans has a tea with raw honey, cayenne, turmeric, fresh ginger and cinnamon. Hotels offer these items to gain an edge during extreme outdoor temperatures, said Scott Berman, a principal and industry leader in hospitality and leisure at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “The country is having a harsh winter, and when that happens, room occupancy goes down so properties will do anything they can to bring in guests,” he said.

Business   New Version of Two-Faced YotaPhone to Have Larger Screens and More Power. Advertisement   The first dual-screen YotaPhone made a splash when it was revealed at the CES trade event in early 2013, winning compliments and awards. It went on sale in several European countries in December for a price equivalent to $675, and for $600 in Russia. The next generation YotaPhone builds on the ideas of the first edition, in a thinner unibody shape with curved edges. It also has some better internal specifications, like a quad core processor and a 2 megapixel front-facing webcam. But its biggest new feature is that the rear electronic paper display has capacitative touch sensing built in, which means it’s also a touchscreen. An annual event that showcases the latest devices, accessories and trends in the mobile industry. While the color touchscreen on the front side is great for running typical Android phone applications and making calls, the new touch sensitive electronic paper display turns the YotaPhone into something that could rival devices like Amazon’s Kindle e-readers. Electronic paper screens are often said to be favored by consumers who read e-books because they look more like printed paper and ink text. Yota Devices points out that this display also makes the new phone suitable for slow-paced games like chess, sudoku or even for crossword puzzles. The company is releasing a software development package so that developers can write applications that make the most of both the phone’s displays, including tricks like showing always-on health and fitness alerts or calendar notifications on the electronic paper screen. Yota is promoting the phone on the strength of the device’s unusual layout, pointing out that about 74 percent of the YotaPhone is useable screen versus the 30 percent to 40 percent of a typical smartphone. When the new device’s battery is running low, it’s also possible to use a “Smart Power” mode. This turns off the power-hungry color display and instead offers basic phone calling, messaging, email access and more via the rear electronic paper display. This is possible because this type of screen can consume less electrical energy than the color screens typically used on smartphones and tablets. The next generation YotaPhone has a 5-inch, 1920-by-1080-pixel OLED screen on the front which is larger than the iPhone 5S’s screen and rivals the display on leading Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S4. The electronic paper screen is 4.7 inches in size and has 960 by 540 pixel resolution. This means both of the phone’s displays are bigger in size and higher in resolutionthan the screens used on the first YotaPhone. The chief executive of Yota Devices, Vladislav Martynov, confirmed during an interview that the new phone would go on sale for the same or slightly less than the cost of typical premium Android phones. This is the same strategy as used for pricing the first-generation YotaPhone, which will go on sale across more markets in Europe, the Middle East and CIS countries soon. The new device is expected to become available later in 2014. Both YotaPhone devices will face fierce competition from Apple, Microsoft and Android smartphone makers like Samsung and HTC. These last two companies are expected to reveal a range of new devices at the MWC show this week, some of which will offer more features than YotaPhone. Apple is expected to release its next generation iPhone later in the year. And Microsoft is expected to produce more Windows phones after taking over Nokia’s smartphone business. Mr. Martynov isn’t fazed however, suggesting that “So far there are no real direct competitors,” to his phone, “because no one offers a second always-on display.” Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Old Railroad Stirs Memories of a Pre-Industrial China. Advertisement   My father rode the Xinning Railway once. He was 4 years old and traveling from Hong Kong with his parents and older brother to their ancestral village in Guangdong Province. It was 1936, in a China without six-lane highways and gleaming airports. They were returning to the countryside to build a new family home. They took a steamboat from Hong Kong to the riverside city of Jiangmen. The ship docked by a customs depot run by officials of the Kuomintang government. The family was carrying a red blanket to give to their grandmother in the village. The officials asked them to pay a tax on the new blanket. They walked to the Beijie train station. The ride to Songlang, the station town closest to their home village, took several hours. Without the train, the journey would have taken one or more days. The idea to write an article on the now-vanished Xinning Railway came to me after hearing stories from my father and his older brother, Sam Wong. The railroad cut through the heart of the lush Taishan region of Guangdong, the point of origin for many overseas Chinese. A private railroad, it had been built as a modernizing project for the region by Chen Yixi, a Chinese immigrant to the United States who had lived for years in Seattle and made a fortune as a labor contractor on railway projects in the American West. Few people these days have first-hand memories of the Xinning Railway, though there are a couple of statues of Mr. Chen in Taishan. “I was just 4 years old,” said my father, who is now 81. “I only remember one thing.” That was the red blanket. My uncle, 85, has other memories. A few years ago, he self-published a memoir about growing up in Hong Kong and China and immigrating to the United States. He devoted six pages to the railway. He wrote about the trip to the home village, Hop Wo, that the family took together in April 1936. He returned to Hong Kong two years later along the same route, but by then officials had suspended regular train operations because of the war with Japan. Instead, what he called a “railroad automobile” was running — just two small cars with no locomotive. The engine was in the front of the first car. Later, after he moved back to the Taishan area, he spent a year of high school in classrooms that were in the railway headquarters. That was from autumn 1943 to June 1944, when the war was still raging. The headquarters was in Taishan City, not far from the village, and next to the West Gate train station. “We used the station concrete platform and nearby grounds for military drills and physical education classes,” my uncle wrote. By then, Kuomintang officials had ordered the railroad dismantled so the Japanese occupiers would not be able to use it. My uncle recalled that from 1942 to 1945 he walked along the abandoned railroad bed between Taishan City and Songlang many times, usually to return to the home village on weekends. It took him about an hour to walk the three and a half miles, or 5.6 kilometers, through the green countryside. “That section had many deep holes, to deter any possible Japanese military vehicle traffic, bordered by a narrow path for walking,” he wrote. When I went to Taishan in January to research the history of the railway, I collaborated with Alan Chin, a photographer with whom I had worked in Iraq and China. Alan was at the end of a one-month research trip in Taishan for a book project. His parents are from Taishan, and he has long had an interest in the region. We drove around and visited a few remnants of the railroad, most notably the Beijie station, where my father and his family had boarded the train for the first time. We also stopped in Songlang, the station town by my ancestral village. It was little more than a cluster of homes and shops flanking a short, paved stretch of road. The most vibrant sign of life came from a three-story elementary school, from which we could hear children’s voices. Across the road was a stretch of abandoned buildings. One had a sign that indicated that the building had been the headquarters of the People’s Mediation Committee, a local Communist Party organization. Next door was a two-story building erected in the early 20th century that had belonged to a Kuomintang official, said a man walking around the front yard of his home, which was littered with rusty junk. The man pointed to an empty spot at one end of the line of derelict buildings – the Songlang train station had once stood there, he said. On our visit to the Beijie station in Jiangmen, Alan and I were accompanied by two journalists from the Jiangmen Daily newspaper, which had recently published stories on the Xinning Railway. We had contacted one reporter, Zhou Huadong, to ask him about the railroad. His colleague, Tan Yueshao, then interviewed us about our own assignment. Both of them seemed struck by the fact that our parents had personal memories of the railroad. The newspaper ran the story by Ms. Tan on its front page, with a photograph taken by Mr. Zhou of me and Alan outside the Beijie station. Alan told me later that his father had talked about the train while Alan was growing up in New York. “For him, it was always combined with the great loss of it, that it was never rebuilt,” Alan said. When the two of them returned to their ancestral village of Sam Hop together in 1989, Alan’s father pointed out that the dirt road on which their minibus was traveling was the old railroad bed. “He said, ‘That’s where the old rail yard used to be. That’s where the old station used to be. That’s where the Japanese bombed the railroad’,” Alan said. “He would point at these spots where you could see nothing.” A quarter-century onward, there is still nothing much to see, except for weeds and earth and shadows.

Society   He Won Her Vote. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIFEB. 23, 2014 Amy Cecilia Salomone and Nicholas Justin Thornton were married Saturday by the Rev. Emmanuel Taylor at St. Dominic’s Catholic Church in San Francisco. The bride, 30, is a San Francisco-based fund-raiser for the House Majority PAC, a political action committee in Washington, working to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives. She graduated from Michigan State University. She is the daughter of Karen M. Salomone and Judge Geno D. Salomone, who live and work in Taylor, Mich. The bride’s father sits on Michigan’s 23rd District Court. Her mother is the executive director of Fish and Loaves, a community food pantry. The groom, 31, is a clinical intern at the Edgewood Center for Children and Families in San Carlos, Calif. He graduated from Seattle University and received a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy from Santa Clara University. He is the son of LeAnn Thornton and Gary D. Thornton, both of South San Francisco. The groom’s mother is the executive assistant in the police department in Hillsborough, Calif. His father retired as a police officer from the South San Francisco Police Department. Advertisement The couple met in May 2006, in Rocky Hill, Conn., while working at the campaign headquarters of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, who faced a tough challenge in the Democratic Party primary. Ms. Salomone and Mr. Thornton worked together for a week before they were dispatched to different offices, she to New London, Conn., and he to New Haven. But nothing clicked during those first few days together. “I was just out of college and really wasn’t paying too much attention to him,” she said. A month later, he joined the New London office as its supervisor and began working long hours side by side with her. “The environment became very stressful, and I’m the type of person who stresses out a lot,” Ms. Salomone said. “Nicholas helped keep me calm with his humor and quiet demeanor, and I admired his great work ethic.” Mr. Thornton discussed his ideas with Ms. Salomone, often over coffee, and began to appreciate her more with each stressful day. “Campaigns are pretty hectic, but she was someone I could always lean on for support,” he said. “She also happened to be the sweetest person I ever met.” On Aug. 2, with the primary less than a week away, they were walking together after another long evening at work. The prospect of a Democratic primary loss had set him to worrying — and not just for Mr. Lieberman’s sake. Mr. Thornton figured a defeat might also cut short his time with Ms. Salomone. So he made an executive decision. “I just blurted out, ‘Can I kiss you?’ ” he said. She said yes. A week later, Mr. Lieberman lost the primary, but soon chose to run as a third-party candidate, which allowed the couple to continue working together (and also won the senator re-election). “It worked out well for all of us,” Mr. Thornton said. “But for me, Amy was by far the best thing to come out of that campaign.” VINCENT M.

Sports   Sochi Olympics Closing Ceremony Latest Updates. Advertisement Russia had so much to prove at the Winter Games. That spending however-many-billion dollars to build an Olympics-industrial complex from scratch on the edge of the Black Sea was worth it. That despite a thicket of security worries, logistical obstacles, weather annoyances and the darkening specter of revolution in nearby Ukraine, the country could put on a Games that ran seamlessly, at times even exuberantly. Its closing ceremony on Sunday night was advertised as a celebration of Russian culture and heritage – a grand party to show off the work of distinguished Russian musicians, dancers, artists and authors through the centuries. But it seemed as much a great sigh of happy relief as anything else. In keeping with these things, the ceremony was often loud, sometimes elegant, sometimes flashy, sometimes bewildering. It opened with an excerpt from Mussorgsky’s lovely “Pictures at an Exhibition”; featured a children’s choir drawn from all over Russia; starred a giddy crowd of post-competition Olympic athletes from various countries rushing in all at once; and hustled people on and offstage so rapidly that it was sometimes hard to catch why they had been there at all. There were references to Kandinsky and to Chagall. There was music by Rachmaninoff, Rubinstein, and Vladimir Horowitz. Dancers from the Bolshoi and the Mariinksy performed in a segment that told a story starring a passel of Ballet Russes characters and its founder, Sergei Diaghilev. Huge banners depicting some of Russia’s greatest authors – Tolstoy, Gogol, Dostoyevsky, even, interestingly, the dissident writer Solzhenitsyn – were displayed, as people ran around waving books in the air. There were clowns and flying brides, a whole lot of pianos and, of course, the Olympic mascots.  A ship is flying out on stage, and a couple thousand more children have jogged out. All holding yellow … shrubs? The yellow petals are like confetti. The children and a woman on the ship are singing about the hospitality of Sochi: Thank you Sochi, a Russian translator explains. A bit more waving from the big bears, the children scurry off, cue the fireworks outside, which we obviously can’t see. And … scene. Place is a bit of a mess. Someone is going to be sweeping yellow petals out of here for a long time. Maybe a few will be around for the World Cup in 2018. Lights are coming up. Overhead we can hear an astounding cacophony of fireworks, which sure looks cool on the TV monitors in here. Time to scoot. Do svidaniya, Sochi! — DAVID SEGAL   This is the incredibly tedious portion of the night, the speeches of the elderly men. It’s like that part of the Grammys when the president of some recording organization comes out and goes on about the greatness of that recording organization. Good time to get a snack. Would take advantage of that opportunity, but again, the chow at the concession stand here is nearly inedible. Mary Pilon reminds us that Pyeongchang beat out Annecy, France, and Munich, Germany, to host the 2018 Games. Clearly, residents of those cities are looking at these cute glowing snowmen and wondering what could have been. — DAVID SEGAL  Pyeongchang now gets exactly 8 minutes 10 seconds to give us a taste of South Korean culture. And it’s a more minimalist approach than the circuses and giant Gogols we’ve been seeing. An old man plays on a gayageum, a 12-string zither, and some dancers dressed as white birds flap to traditional Korean music. It’s gentle and evocative and will no doubt be a lot better than the next item on the program: 6 minutes 45 seconds of “Speeches.” the south koreans are pushing what appear to be giant ping pong balls around the stage. — Sarah Lyall (@sarahlyall) 23 Feb 14 — VICTOR MATHER  We stood for the Russian anthem at the start. Then the Norwegian and Russian anthems for the cross-country medal ceremonies. Now we stand for the anthem of Greece (birthplace of the Games). And we’re told to remain standing for the Olympic anthem. Really? Now the Olympic flag is handed from the mayor of Sochi to the mayor of Pyeongchang, host of the 2018 Winter Games. And it’s back on our feet again for the South Korean anthem. — VICTOR MATHER   Another of the arts for which Russia is known is circuses, and we have an enormous one spread on the arena floor for the next six minutes. More than 400 clowns, acrobats, jugglers and contortionists do their thing as a giant tent is erected. The music is Shostakovich’s “Suite for Variety Orchestra, Waltz No. 2,” which the program points out was used in “Eyes Wide Shut.” Which of course raises the question: Which is creepier “Eyes Wide Shut,” or clowns? Mary Pilon, who has been down at the coastal cluster for much of the last two weeks, gives us a little contextual analysis of the circus segment. “Clowns have maintained a heavy presence in the Olympic Park these couple of weeks: big clowns, short clowns, rabbit clowns, mimes, etc. They’ve been a big hit among fans roaming the grounds. I’d even go so far to say this has been the best-ever Olympics for the clown population.” — VICTOR MATHER   Got to love a country that gives its greatest novelists the celebrity treatment. In the United States, you need a movie franchise to get that kind of applause and attention. Among the authors: Vladimir Nabokov, who fled Russia. And Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who was most famous for writing about Stalin’s gulags. — DAVID SEGAL  We haven’t covered literature yet, have we? It’s time for a host of performers to act as characters from great Russian works like “War and Peace,” “Eugene Onegin,” and “Three Sisters.” Enormous pictures of Gogol, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and others rise and receive an unaccountably loud cheer. It’s a well-read audience, clearly. There are also numerous performers dressed as librarians, bringing to mind the tribute to doctors and nurses at London’s opening ceremony. David Segal mentions that, “A chandelier has descended from the ceiling that is described as ‘elaborate’ in the program. That really understates it. That surely is earth’s biggest chandelier. It’s like being in a Liberace dream, looking at that thing.” One last warning: Clowns ahead. Clowns ahead! — VICTOR MATHER  Just as happened during the opening ceremony, the temperature here at the stadium is dropping by the minute. I’ve heard about comedy and talk shows that keep the audience chilled, but an Olympic ceremony? Not like any of us is at risk of getting drowsy. The music here is amped up to rock concert levels. The spectacle alone will keep us wide-eyed. Maybe they just ran out of money when the heating-the-stadium budget came in. — DAVID SEGAL  What could be better than a performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2? How about a performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 as 62 other pianos are frantically rolled around the arena by men in Mozart wigs? From music, we move on to ballet. Those two archrival ballet companies, the Bolshoi and Mariinsky (Kirov), join together in the Olympic spirit of friendship to perform a tribute to great Russian dance figures, including Pavlova and Diaghilev. Each troupe gets its own proscenium arch in its signature colors, red and gold (Bolshoi) and blue and gold (Mariinsky). — VICTOR MATHER  A tribute to Russian artists now, with a cast of 120 that our program says includes 10 brides suspended from clouds and 41 stilt walkers and jumpers. It’s a living enactment of a painting by Marc Chagall. The highlight is the upside-down house, which is lifted from one of his paintings. Or maybe it’s a composite. Whatever it is, it looks pretty amazing. Program says that Chagall painted a “fantasy world reflecting an alternate reality of happiness and new horizons.” Well, he also painted the shtetls, which were real places. Nonetheless, this is an artist who was all but invisible during the era of the Soviet Union. Guy was Jewish and he was an emigre, two strikes against, back in the day. Let’s consider him back in the embrace of his motherland. It’s Rachmaninoff. And “Piano Concert No. 2.” Been a while since this has been heard without a figure skater around. Waiting for one of these pianos to do a triple lutz, then fall down. It could happen. — DAVID SEGAL   Athletes in the rear of this massive parade are taking photos of each other and getting the, “Hey, get moving” from the “Dune” extras. Now they’re actually taking photos of the “Dune” extras. Now with the “Dune” extras. Koreans, we now see from the backs of their uniforms. Those guys want to stick around and ham it up. — DAVID SEGAL  The athletes of the Games are next to arrive. Since 1956, they have arrived at the closing ceremony not by nation, but as one group, symbolizing fraternity between nations. Still, judging by the clumps of similar uniforms, most are still primarily fraternizing with their teammates. The flags of the nations arrive together as well, with each carried by an athlete chosen by its delegation. Among the flag-carriers are the biathlon heroes Martin Fourcade of France and Ole Einar Bjorndalen of Norway, as well as the 55-year-old German prince who represented Mexico in skiing, Hubertus Von Hohenlohe. Though many nations have selected their most accomplished athlete for the honor of bearing the flag, the United States has opted for a silver medal winner, Julie Chu, part of the women’s hockey team that lost the final to Canada in heart-breaking fashion. Next up will be two gold-medal ceremonies, for the women’s and men’s marathon cross-country races. We’ll get to hear the Norwegian and, again, the Russian anthems. Mary gives a shout-out to India: Since the opening ceremony, the India Olympic committee was reinstated. That’s the first time in Olympic history that a reinstatement has occurred during an Games. Among other things, the American athletes are wearing baggy white pants that, weirdly, kind of taper at the ankle. — Sarah Lyall (@sarahlyall) 23 Feb 14    Not sure what this part will look like on TV, but in person it’s like all the extras from that David Lynch movie, “Dune,” got together for a little dance party, and it was crashed by hundreds of people waving flags. And then a bunch of athletes. And a D.J. who has a thing for ’90s-era synth pop. — DAVID SEGAL  Sam Dolnick is trying to find out whether one of the stagehands is wearing a onesie or not. Yes, I’m serious. — MARY PILON  There was a quick shot of Putin before the singing of the national anthem. Is there some law against Russian heads of state smiling? Seriously, the country spends $51 billion on this production, much of it taxpayer rubles, and he can’t even pretend to enjoy himself? What would be so wrong with a grin, Mr. President? No points off for a grin. The grump thing might work at a G-8 meeting. It just seems spoil-sporty here. — DAVID SEGAL   The shimmering silver performers form the Olympic rings … only one of the rings is a small ball rather than a full ring. It’s a cute and funny allusion to the failure of one of the rings to open at the opening ceremony. A nice touch that gets a big reaction from the crowd. After a moment for everyone to get the joke, the ring opens up correctly. President Vladimir V. Putin arrives and all of those in his presidential box leap to their feet to applaud vigorously. Now the Russian flag is brought in amid much pomp. The national anthem is performed by a 1,000-voice children’s choir. Among the bearers of the Russian flag is Vic Wild, the American-born snowboarder who won two golds for Russia here. — VICTOR MATHER  There is a Russian announcer here, taking turns with an announcer speaking French and English. Russian guy sounds like he’s having waaaay more fun. He’s delighted. He’s having a blast. Sounds like he’s leering, ever so slightly. The other two announcers sound moribund by comparison. Da. Let’s go English and French! Perk it up! It’s the Olympics. — DAVID SEGAL  Hordes of sequined performers swarming the stadium here. Like they stole the costumes from figure skaters and shaved off the flashy parts. They are running in formations that look like waves, which is fitting because they appear to be running atop a floor that is tricked out to resemble the ocean. The TV version makes a bit more sense because it’s shot from the top. Message is loud and clear: They’re going big with this production. — DAVID SEGAL  Fireworks erupt over the stadium and we are underway! A rowboat sails through the sky, taking Luba, the little girl who starred in the opening ceremony, on a voyage through Russian culture. Her boat is piloted by clowns. Yes, there will be clowns in tonight’s performance. Fair warning. — VICTOR MATHER   Refresher: London’s closing ceremony featured the Who, a dude getting shot out of a cannon and a reunion of the Spice Girls. To quote the snowboarders here, I’m stoked, but the bar is never low for pageantry at the Games. — MARY PILON  The ceremony officially begins at the symbolic time of 20:14. (That’s 8:14 p.m., or 11:14 a.m. Eastern.) In the meantime, the preshow has stopped, and the arena has gone somewhat quiet, aside from recorded eerie organ music combined with angelic (or demonic) sopranos singing “ahhhh.” Hundreds of long pipes have also descended from the ceiling, their purpose unclear. The crowd breaks the creepy mood with chants of “Russ-i-yah.” But even they can’t drown out the ethereal sopranos, who seem to be hitting higher notes every moment. — VICTOR MATHER   Whatever the evening brings, we know this much: it will vastly exceed what they are serving at the concession stands here. Wow. “Lump of bread” appears to be one of the big draws, though it probably has a more alluring name. Went with the hot dog. Tastes a bit like a bumper. Or what one imagines a bumper would taste like. The Russians have borrowed mightily from our pop culture, but they need some work on their stadium food. A lot of work. Stat! — DAVID SEGAL  Greetings! We’re in place in Fisht Stadium. The pregame scene thus far is very akin to that of opening ceremony. A nice woman and man talking to us in Russian while lights flicker in the stands and pop music blares and fans trickle in. I’m pleased to report that Segway camera dude, the unsung hero of the opening ceremony, has returned. En route, I caught a glimpse of the Olympians lining up in their festive gear at the athletes’ village. — MARY PILON  It’s time for the preshow! Surely some of the best stuff will be shown now before an audience of a few thousand early arrivals in the stadium rather than saved for the hundreds of millions watching the main ceremony on television later. Right? Right? And here comes the opening act. It’s a rock band with violins that plays an extraordinarily diverse medley that includes “Money” by Pink Floyd, “We Are the Champions,” the “Mission Impossible” theme song and that “duh duh duh, duh-duh duh” song played at hockey games. Sorry, that’s the best way I can describe it. And now the runners-up from the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest: Buranovskiye Babushki, a group of eight Russian grandmothers. They perform their big hit, “Everybody Dance,” with the lyrics changed to add the words “Sochi” and “Olympics.” Now it’s the glam metal band Gorky Park with their 1992 hit “Moscow Calling” Who left these boys out of the main ceremony? Scandal! — VICTOR MATHER  Forget sports. What really unites the world are pictures where people pretend to be holding giant things. http://t.co/VbSchPjFVV — Sam Dolnick (@samdolnick) 23 Feb 14  As at the opening ceremony, it’s surprisingly chilly in Fisht Stadium, a roofed, semi-enclosed arena. This time we received fair warning. A news release this morning cautioned: “Media should be aware that temperatures in the stadium can be significantly lower than elsewhere in the Olympic precinct. Tribunes are covered but not protected from winds blowing from the sea.” After the incongruous feeling of warm sun at a Winter Olympics, even sometimes high in the mountains, spectators tonight are finally getting a more typical taste of the season. Many of those around me are putting their jackets back on and adding hats or hoods to ward off those Black Sea gusts. — VICTOR MATHER  We’re still a couple hours away from the start of proceedings, but your correspondent has finagled his way into the stadium already and is getting a sneak peek at rehearsal. Much of what is to transpire is off limits for reporting until the ceremony starts, but I think I can say that I’ve just heard two stirring renditions of the Russian national anthem. It’s one of the few that really has the musical power to knock your socks off, and it seems we will be getting a particularly full-throated rendition tonight. We’ve already been tipped off that there will be a 1,000-voice children’s choir at the show, and all signs are that that number may just be scratching the surface of the cast tonight. — VICTOR MATHER Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Travel   Back to Borneo, and an Eden at Risk. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREN J. COATESFEB. 21, 2014 There are no roads to the village of Pa Lungan, just a mucky water buffalo trail beneath a tight-knit canopy — among the last standing highland jungles on the island of Borneo. In spots, the trail is more swamp than path. But that does not mean all is quiet: The rain forest is a cacophonous place. Cicadas squeal and monkeys hoot as they romp through the trees. Bamboo creaks in the breeze as its stalks grind and rub in a primitive dance. Our journey through Borneo began seven years ago, when, on a whim, my husband and I visited the Kelabit Highlands, situated in Sarawak, one of two Malaysian states on the island. I’d been invited to a conference in the capital city of Kuching; with some time on our hands, we headed to this remote region, most easily accessible by turboprop plane, which flew a few times each week from Miri, on the coast, to the small town of Bario. (The alternatives were many hours, even days, on precarious logging roads, or several weeks on foot through the forest.) Thanks to a reporting fellowship, we found ourselves back in the Highlands last year. Things had changed somewhat — that flight now leaves twice daily, and a newly graded dirt road eases travel in and out of Bario. The town had grown slightly — more houses, a few concrete-slab roads — but the tempo had not. Bario Asal, the town’s original longhouse, remains, albeit a bit quieter than in years past. But local families still gather by unvented fires in a common area filled with smoke and chitchat. Tourists come to see this. “More tourists, every day,” a Kelabit elder named Jenette Ulun said — one or two a day, sometimes a dozen. “There are more tourists than us locals,” she joked. For centuries, the Kelabit people lived isolated lives, best known to the outside world as champion headhunters. But that began to change under the reign of the so-called White Rajahs, a British family by the name of Brooke, who reigned in Sarawak from 1841 to 1946 and tried to rid the region of headhunting. Meanwhile, Christian missionaries converted the Kelabits in the 1940s and clamped down on alcohol consumption. Ever since, the Kelabits, who now number about 6,000, have gladly practiced evangelical Christianity with ceremonies far less laborious than their old animist rituals, they say. And the Kelabits have modernized in other ways: Gone are skulls hanging from the rafters, replaced by fireside cellphones and laptops. Until a few years ago, travelers came for the “Bario Loop,” and other multiday treks organized by local Kelabit guides that hugged the Indonesian border through jungles now logged. These days, most visitors take shorter hikes and experience Kelabit culture in local homes. On our first trip to Bario, my husband and I lodged at De Plateau, a homestay near the forest leading to Pa Lungan. I remember the cold-water showers and the outdoor sink, which faced a panorama of blue-green hills bathed in flowery air. Dinners consisted of fried wild boar, fiddlehead ferns and sautéed, burgundy-red ginger flowers. Advertisement We hired a guide who led us up and down a sodden trail, a foot-long blade called a parang hanging from a scabbard at his hip. Five hours on, we found Pa Lungan, set like a mountain oasis amid verdant, dewy grasses and sparkling ponds. That’s where we met Walter Paran, our village host. He took us to his wooden house set on stilts, where we met his wife, Moriaty, and his then-toddler daughter, Mujan. Walter’s mother squatted by a blackened hearth, tending a pot of simmering cucumber. “Very simple food,” Walter said. Advertisement We also met Walter’s brother, Pasen Mado Inan, who praised the forests around him. “Most of the things we need for every day come from the jungle,” he said. He feared it would disappear — the trucks were getting closer. “We hate the logging.” Walter asked us to return so he could take us deeper into the forest, “before logging disturbs that side.” As my husband and I flew out of Bario a few days later, we saw early evidence of what he feared. Below, thick jungle turned to naked hills laced with ruddy roads. “No one can stop them,” our pilot said. “It’s disgusting.” For years, I wondered what became of Walter, his family and their forests. I read of jungles all over Borneo, chopped and cleared, replanted with palms. To raze a rain forest is to bulldoze one of the earth’s biggest carbon stores. To erase this forest would also be to annihilate an age-old way of life. Seven years later, we returned, again flying a turboprop into Bario. This time, we stayed with Stephen Baya, a Kelabit artist, and his Danish wife, Tine Hjetting, in their homestay-gallery called Jungle Blues Dream, in a longhouse overlooking the wild yonder of rice paddies, homes and wooded hills that disappeared each morning in a shroud of fog. Stephen, a self-taught artist, fills his wooden walls with vivid trees of life, a motif that symbolizes, for him, a “journey never-ending.” Stephen was born in the Highlands but spent years working for Hilton, Holiday Inn and a Printemps department store elsewhere in Malaysia. He prefers Bario. Living the city life, he said, means “always having to think about tomorrow, think about next week.” When I told Stephen of my search for Walter, he relayed the message. Spotty cellphone coverage now permeates parts of the jungle. (We later learned that if Walter wedges his phone into one particular window and stands back, he can sometimes maintain a conversation.) Walter successfully received Stephen’s message and said he awaited our arrival. Stephen drove us to the road’s end, and from there, we hoofed it, packs on backs, sticks in hand. Along the way, elements of our first trip came back: the tests of balance provided by bridges the width of two logs that spanned streams and broad swaths of mud; an avenue of palms beneath higher, old-growth trees. We stopped at the palms, sat on a log and ate canned chicken curry. In the distance, we heard what sounded like faint, high-pitched voices. There were no trails, no villages, no one around. Perhaps it was wind, making the treetops squeak. Elders later spoke of talking spirits that occasionally spook villagers on foot in the forest. Pa Lungan was idyllic as ever. We found Walter’s home, but he was out somewhere. Moriaty and Mujan, who was 9 by the time of our return visit, offered us instant coffee, fried shrimp crackers and a seat at their long wooden table. After a cold bucket shower and a short rest, we joined a party next door: Village hunters had caught a boar that morning, and its head crackled on the fire. They offered strips of hot, juicy fat and grilled petai beans, known for their sulfuric stench but delicious flavor. The sky that evening was a spectacle of tropical-fruit colors: tangerine, passionfruit, papaya. Then darkness fell, and Walter’s generator rumbled on. The power allowed for a few efficiency lights, and a TV — the latter an addition since our previous visit. Mujan lay under a blanket, watching Bruce Lee chop his way through “Fist of Fury.” Advertisement In the morning, we were greeted by Walter, who remembered us and had many things to share. He wanted to show us why tourists still come to Pa Lungan. “They love the place because it’s still green,” he said. Nearby Pulong Tau National Park was expanded in 2008, creating a buffer between his village and the logging threat, he told us. He said Pa Lungan remains a “nice, quiet place” — for now. Together, we hiked a nearby mountain, across the soft earthen floor beneath palms that Walter’s ancestors had planted generations ago. The forest was dense. “This one you can call primary jungle,” he said. From there, we scrambled a near-vertical climb to the hilltop, where a giant metal cross, placed by someone from Pa Lungan (its exact origins are murky), was dedicated to “God’s saving grace”; a sign commemorates the need to avoid bringing “anything detestable” into the land. Below, Pa Lungan seemed to float in an undulating sea of trees. THAILAND VIETNAM MYANMAR South China Sea CAMBODIA BRUNEI Sabah MALAYSIA Sarawak SINGAPORE BORNEO INDONESIA Indian Ocean 400 miles That’s Indonesia, Walter said, pointing to the horizon. He added: “Other side of the mountain, they already logged.” He eyed the area behind the cross, toward another area that had already been logged. From this vantage, we could also see Pulong Tau. Walter hoped the park would last, that its boundaries would hold; not all government decisions do, he had told us earlier. Walter knew he was living in an Eden at risk, but has always said he will fight for it. “I’m the one who’s always fighting against this logging,” he told me in 2006. Today, he has more hope for this view, still intact. We peered across thick stands of trees where Walter had taken us foraging for edible palms and rattans, and bamboos with liquid inside. He said he could live in that forest on the food and drink it provided. It had, after all, sustained centuries of people before him. “That’s why we need to keep our jungle,” he said. Bario, and most Kelabit villages, offer homestay lodging with meals included. Jungle Blues Dream (junglebluesdream.weebly.com) charges 70 ringgit per person per day, about $21 at 3.25 ringgit to the dollar. The owners can help arrange guides (typically 80 to 100 ringgit a day) and lodging elsewhere. Prices for homestay lodgings generally range from 50 to 90 ringgit a day. Several Pa Lungan villagers welcome guests, at similar rates, including Walter Paran; arrange in advance from Bario or simply show up.

Business   @GSElevator Tattletale Exposed (He Was Not in the Goldman Elevator). Advertisement A three-year parlor game has been taking place on Wall Street to identify the Goldman Sachs employee behind a Twitter account that purports to reveal the uncensored comments overheard in the firm’s elevators. The Twitter account, @GSElevator, reports overheard remarks like, “I never give money to homeless people. I can’t reward failure in good conscience,” and “Groupon…Food stamps for the middle class.” The Twitter account, which has an audience of more than 600,000 followers, has been the subject of an internal inquiry at Goldman to find the rogue employee. The tweets, often laced with insider references to deals in the news, appeal to both Wall Street bankers and outsiders who mock the industry. Late last month, the writer sold a book about Wall Street culture based on the tweets for a six-figure sum.   The author is a 34-year-old former bond executive who lives in Texas. His name is John LeFevre. He had tried to remain anonymous, scrubbing the Internet of mentions of his name and pictures of himself on all but a handful of sites. Some people had already speculated that @GSElevator was not hanging around the halls of Goldman. The ability of people like Mr. LeFevre to create anonymous Twitter accounts underscores concerns about the veracity of what is published and the identity of authors. It also raises questions about whether publishers are blurring the line between real life and the made-up kind. Upon being contacted late last week after several weeks of reporting uncovered his identity, he confirmed his alter ego. “Frankly, I’m surprised it has taken this long,” he said by phone. “I knew this day would come.” Mr. LeFevre, who worked for Citigroup for seven years, said the Twitter account started as “a joke to entertain myself.” He quickly interrupted the inevitable line of questioning about how he had never worked at Goldman and appeared to be an impostor. “To pre-empt what you’re about to say, legally speaking,” he said, “I was never explicitly an employee of the firm.” Mr. LeFevre was offered a job as head of debt syndicate in Asia at Goldman’s Hong Kong office in August 2010, but the offer was later revoked, according to people at the firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Mr. LeFevre said his previous employer contended that he was bound by a noncompete agreement and “things turned nasty with my old boss and he threatened a lawsuit against me and Goldman.” By Mr. LeFevre’s own account of his experience with Goldman: “My contract was never rescinded. We cordially agreed to part ways to avoid a public mess. I don’t know how much I can talk about it. It wasn’t acrimonious.” When pressed about whether he had implicitly misrepresented himself as a Goldman employee, he said he deliberately never said in any of his tweets that he worked for the firm. “This was never about me as a person,” he said. “It wasn’t about a firm. The stories aren’t Goldman Sachs in particular. It was about the culture in general.” A Goldman spokesman, after being told that @GSElevator had been unmasked, said in a statement, “We are pleased to report that the official ban on talking in elevators will be lifted effective immediately.” The fact that Mr. LeFevre was not a Goldman employee did not appear to dissuade his publisher, Touchstone, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, which said it had not been misled. “He’s been pretty straight with us the entire time, so this is not a surprise,” said the book’s editor, Matthew Benjamin, who bought the book without ever meeting Mr. LeFevre. “That you’re writing about him speaks to the interest he’s generated. We always expected his identity to be revealed at some point.” Mr. LeFevre’s agent, Byrd Leavell, said: “What matters is that every story in the book is true. John’s material he delivered is hilarious. The book isn’t going to live or die on whether he worked at Goldman Sachs for two months or not.” Mr. LeFevre, who started at Citigroup in New York in 2001 after graduating from Babson College before moving with the firm to London and then Hong Kong, said that he was inspired to start the Twitter account in the fall of 2011. “I was sitting around with a friend at a bar,” he said. At the time, an account called @CondeElevator had sprung up, supposedly chronicling the goings-on in the elevator of the media company Condé Nast. “I thought, ‘This is ridiculous that people are infatuated with Condé Nast. If they only saw the elitist, sexist and out-of-touch things bankers say.’ People had no idea what it is really like.” He said he chose to name his account after Goldman Sachs because “it was commercial.” In an email, Mr. LeFevre added, Goldman “has more love/hate Main Street appeal.” At the time, the Occupy Wall Street movement was in full swing. He said he was also struck by some of the lines, comical to him, he heard from people at Goldman when he first received a job offer. “Even socializing with them — going to bars and having guys buy girls drinks and then throw out a line like, ‘Don’t worry ladies, these drinks are on Goldman Sachs.’ ” Mr. LeFvre, who left Citigroup in 2008 and began to work at a start-up boutique firm in 2009 in Hong Kong, insisted that many of the exchanges he published on Twitter were true: “I’ve been collecting these stories for years.” He said his intent was neither to mock nor glamorize Wall Street. “I do not have an agenda to paint the people or this culture one way or the other,” he said, adding that he was “always a cynical banker” when he worked on Wall Street but “I loved it. We did a lot of crazy stuff. It’s not like I had a great epiphany along the way.” Still, he said that working on Wall Street was an eye-opener. “I went into investment banking and I saw a group of people that aren’t as impressive as I thought they were — or as impressive as they thought they were. They defined themselves as human beings by their jobs.” His Twitter feed has become red meat for industry critics, something Mr. LeFevre said was initially unintentional but later something he tried to stoke. “A lot of times I pander, I’ll be honest with you. I pander for retweets,” he said, referring to users blasting copies of a tweet to their own followers, multiplying its reach. He said his Twitter account had evolved over the last few years: “Early on, I tweeted more about specific people or deals, inside jokes/commentary, and even a few ad hominem attacks. That gave me a certain validation and credibility. But over time, the tweets have been increasingly styled to have a bit more commercial appeal. “I don’t consider it selling out or pandering to a lower common denominator; I think of it more as adapting to what the widest possible audience of people responds favorably to.” Mr. LeFevre, who refused to disclose his location in Texas, started worrying several months ago that his identity would be revealed. He received some emails from friends who had guessed it was him. He also noticed that some Goldman Sachs employees had viewed his LinkedIn profile page; he later removed it. Now that he has been outed, he said, “it’s something that can be embraced. And I certainly don’t have anything to hide.” A sampling of musings from GSElevator’s Twitter account: #1: I just want to be rich enough to not be motivated by money. — GS Elevator Gossip (@GSElevator) 14 Dec 13 #1: Only Neanderthals resort to violence.

Foreign   Leopard on Loose Paralyzes Northern Indian City. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — A roaming leopard has caused life in the northern Indian city of Meerut to come to a halt. Since Sunday, the leopard has attacked a police official, a television news cameraman and four residents, all of whom survived, but the police official and cameraman have been hospitalized, Pankaj Yadav, the chief official of Meerut district, said Monday. Several others were hurt when a crowd of people watching the leopard ran in panic after the animal started jumping at onlookers. Schools and colleges have been closed, and some women are not allowing their husbands and children outside the home. Meanwhile, police officials, wildlife experts and forest officials are working to catch the leopard. The Indian Army has also offered assistance. The leopard was first seen midday Sunday in a warehouse in central Meerut, a city of 1.5 million people 45 miles north of New Delhi in Uttar Pradesh. As the word spread, thousands of people gathered. “A man tried to show a bit of bravado and went close to the leopard,” said Abdur Rahman, the owner of cloth shop who was one of the observers. “The leopard injured him on his hand, and that created panic among onlookers.” The leopard, disturbed by people and camera flashes, leaped onto the wall of a nearby hospital and entered the building, where he remained for several hours. A wildlife team was called in from a neighboring district. “We used the tranquilizers three times and hit it twice,” said Mayukh Chatterjee of the Wildlife Trust of India, who is the head of a four-member wildlife expert team in Meerut. “He got a bit drowsy, but he was so powerful that he could break a concrete wall and jumped out. In my last 16 years of work, I have not seen such a long and powerful leopard.” He said the leopard may be around eight to 10 feet long and weighs around 80 to 85 kilograms, or 176 to 187 pounds. The leopard was last seen entering and exiting Vidya Laxmi Complex, a commercial center, said Sushant Sharma, the forest chief of Meerut district. “There is a sense of fear among people. We are doing our best,” said Mr. Sharma. Mr. Rahman, the cloth shop owner, who also lives near the complex, said the leopard sightings have been reported all over the city. “We are hearing all kinds of rumors like, the leopard is in the complex or at the hospital or at the mall,” he said. “My daughters wanted to come out and to see the whole drama, but my wife told them not to go out. She even wanted me also to remain at home today,” he said. The tension in the area is compounded with the fact that a man-eating tigress has killed at least 10 people in the neighboring districts in the last two months. “In such situations of men-animal conflict, it becomes more difficult to control the crowd,” said Mr. Chatterjee. “Wherever we go, we are followed by large number of people and a big media group.” Mr. Yadav said wildlife experts and forest officials did not find any leopard tracks or see the leopard on Monday. “Our teams will move around the whole night,” he said. “Yesterday, the city was quite in a panic, and 4,000 to 5,000 people were gathered on the streets. Today, because leopard has not been seen anywhere so there’s less fear.” India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Travel   A Token of Anne Frank’s Childhood, on View. Advertisement The set of marbles that Anne Frank played with before she was forced into hiding are on display for the first time. The marbles and their original tin box take center stage in the exhibit “The Second World War in 100 Objects,” which runs through May 11 at the Kunsthal Rotterdam. Like other Jewish children who gave away their toys when they had to report for deportation or go into hiding, Anne Frank left several treasured possessions with a neighborhood playmate, Toosje Kupers, before she and her family moved into the “secret annex” on the Prinsengracht canal in Amsterdam on July 6, 1942. Ms. Kupers, now 83, donated several items of Frank’s — a toy tea set, a book and the marbles — to the Anne Frank House. Other artifacts in the World War II exhibit include the grave marker cross of  the American pilot James M. Hansen, who is buried at the Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial at Margraten; a decoy paratrooper dummy, known as a “Rupert,” used by the British to deceive the German troops; and a sweater made from dog’s hair during the Dutch famine of 1944-45.

Business   Shell Game. Advertisement By Ruth B. Margolin Feb 26, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — Today marks the debut of crossword constructor Ruth B. Margolin, whose first-ever New York Times puzzle has been rated a Wednesday difficulty. Not bad for a newcomer. Appropriately enough for a debut, the puzzle’s language exudes the idea of achievement and of reaching new heights. There’s a nod to the first flight of the Wright brothers with the clue for AVIATE and to another entry about upward-climbing mountaineers with ASCENTS. Those who enjoy a good echo will be treated to a fine example today with the repeat use of the word “shell.” The clues in question are “Shell carries it” and “It carries a shell,” referring, respectively to GAS and a SNAIL. Context is key, folks — it could mean the difference between an oil company and a mollusk. Some other noteworthy entries include “1984 superstate” for EURASIA, and “winter topper” for SKI CAP. I had no idea about the answer for “sheer curtain fabric” at 38 Across, but I was bailed out by a couple familiar crossers — among them, Che GUEVARA, the trusty SPORK, and an airtight ALIBI. That gave me more than enough letters to hazard a guess about the fabric, and voilà! It’s VOILE! Now I’ll turn the mike over to Ruth: I am quite excited to have my first puzzle published, and what began as a lark has become an engaging hobby. I solve the puzzle daily, and occasionally a puzzle takes a particular approach to playing with language that gives me an “I can do that!” feeling and sends me off in search of words and puns that fit my concept. I no longer remember any particular puzzle that sparked the wordplay part of my brain and led me to create this one, adding IST to familiar words. The challenge of course, was that the addition of IST had to change the meaning of the word entirely. There’s no humor in changing “violin” to “violinist.” So to the word lists. I pored through lists of words containing IST, mentally subtracting the IST to find those words that could then be built into phrases that had the potential to win a chuckle once the IST was put back in. So from “cubist” to “cub” to “cub reporter” to CUBISTREPORTER. I think my favorite answer has to be SLEEPERCELLISTS (though my proposed clue was “Musicians who tend to be flat?”). Having played in the wind section of orchestras throughout my youth, I know what it is to count many dozens of measures of rests before an entrance, trying to maintain concentration, while the string players played without pause. It always seemed possible that someone might one day fall asleep, but I never thought it would be the cellists! I was pleased with the phrases I was able to create, and even more pleased that Will (finally!) liked them, too. (I don’t think I have to confess here just how many of my submissions have not made the grade….) So now that I’ve met Will’s standards and made my debut, am I a strict constructionIST?

Foreign   New Coalition Takes On India’s Two Biggest Parties. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — Eleven political parties, including seven regional parties, formed a coalition on Tuesday in hopes of drawing voters away from India’s two main national parties in the general elections in May. “We have resolved to come together to present an alternative before the country,” said Prakash Karat, general secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist), one of the members of the coalition, which is made up of the biggest regional parties in India, like the Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (United). Mr. Karat condemned the Indian National Congress, which leads the governing coalition in New Delhi, for its corruption scandals and policies, which he called flawed, and accused the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., of trying to divide the country with its Hindu nationalist politics. He said nine parties met in the capital on Tuesday to form the alliance, with the leaders of the two other parties, Biju Janata Dal and Asom Gana Parishad, unable to attend but giving their assent. Sanjay Kaul, the B.J.P. spokesman for the party’s New Delhi chapter, dismissed the new coalition as a nonfactor in the elections. “No front can survive unless it has a magnetic core or a gravitational pull,” he said. “They may coalesce because of situational advantages, but when it comes to a push and a shove, they would surely break down.” The coalition comes at a time when opinion polls conducted by media organizations have suggested that regional political parties could play a major role in forming the next government in case either of the two national parties fall short of an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament. Currently, the coalition has 92 seats in the lower house. That compares with 201 seats for the Congress party and 112 for the Bharatiya Janata Party. A party or alliance needs to have at least 272 members in the Lok Sabha, which has 543 members, to have any realistic chance of forming the next government. But even if the new coalition, which does not yet have a name, manages to take power, a look at the history of Indian politics shows that such so-called third-front governments – that is, those that are not led by Congress or the B.J.P. — have largely been unstable and unable to complete the full five-year term. One of the early experiments in third-front politics occurred in 1989, when a broad coalition of parties under Janata Dal formed a government under Prime Minister V.P. Singh. But disagreements among allies and the creation of factions led the government to fold in less than a year. Another coalition government was formed, this time under Chandra Shekhar, but this too splintered within a year. In 1996, the same scenes played out when the general elections ended in a fractured mandate. After B.J.P., which emerged as the single largest party with 161 seats, was unable to cobble together a majority in the Lok Sabha, a similar third-front government under Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda of Janata Dal came to power with the support of the Congress party. However, coalition strains again led the government to fall within a year. I.K. Gujral, another Janata Dal leader, was nominated to the prime minister’s post the same year, but he too could not stay in power for long. The government fell the next year and fresh elections were called. Since 1998, leaders of regional parties with prime ministerial ambitions have largely been forced to stand aside, as all central governments have been led by either the Congress party or the B.J.P. “It is my personal opinion that the third front is not at all plausible,” said Subhash Kashyap, an honorary professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. “It will not have a sizable win in the elections.” He said if the new coalition came to power, it would probably discourage economic development in India because of the inherent instability of such an alliance and the ideologies of the members. “If there is no political stability, there can be no economic reforms,” he said. “If you see the constituents of the third front, some of them are very much against economic reforms.” Rohit Ghosh, vice president and a senior research analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a statement this month that the rise of regional parties would continue to “hamper the efficacy of nationwide policy making, regardless of the political complexion of the eventual central government.” However, he said, a phenomenal showing by any of the country’s major parties would not guarantee economic growth either. How do you think the new coalition will do in the national elections? Please leave your comments below. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   The Brain’s Inner Language. Advertisement Advertisement The Map Makers By JAMES GORMAN FEB. 24, 2014 Clay Reid and colleagues are going deep into the mouse brain to decipher the conversations and decisions of neurons. SEATTLE — When Clay Reid decided to leave his job as a professor at Harvard Medical School to become a senior investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle in 2012, some of his colleagues congratulated him warmly and understood right away why he was making the move. Others shook their heads. He was, after all, leaving one of the world’s great universities to go to the academic equivalent of an Internet start-up, albeit an extremely well- financed, very ambitious one, created in 2003 by Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft. Still, “it wasn’t a remotely hard decision,” Dr. Reid said. He wanted to mount an all-out investigation of a part of the mouse brain. And although he was happy at Harvard, the Allen Institute offered not only great colleagues and deep pockets, but also an approach to science different from the classic university environment. The institute was already mapping the mouse brain in fantastic detail, and specialized in the large-scale accumulation of information in atlases and databases available to all of science. Now, it was expanding, and trying to merge its semi-industrial approach to data gathering with more traditional science driven by individual investigators, by hiring scientists like Christof Koch from the California Institute of Technology as chief scientific officer in 2011 and Dr. Reid. As a senior investigator, he would lead a group of about 100, and work with scientists, engineers and technicians in other groups. Without the need to apply regularly for federal grants, Dr. Reid could concentrate on one piece of the puzzle of how the brain works. He would try to decode the workings of one part of the mouse brain, the million neurons in the visual cortex, from, as he puts it, “molecules to behavior.” Advertisement There are many ways to map the brain and many kinds of brains to map. Although the ultimate goal of most neuroscience is understanding how human brains work, many kinds of research can’t be done on human beings, and the brains of mice and even flies share common processes with human brains. The work of Dr. Reid, and scientists at Allen and elsewhere who share his approach, is part of a surge of activity in brain research as scientists try to build the tools and knowledge to explain — as well as can ever be explained — how brains and minds work. Besides the Obama administration’s $100 million Brain Initiative and the European Union’s $1 billion, decade-long Human Brain Project, there are numerous private and public research efforts in the United States and abroad, some focusing on the human brain, others like Dr. Reid’s focusing on nonhumans. While the Human Connectome Project, which is spread among several institutions, aims for an overall picture of the associations among parts of the human brain, other scientific teams have set their sights on drilling to deeper levels. For instance, the Connectome Project at Harvard is pursuing a structural map of the mouse brain at a level of magnification that shows packets of neurochemicals at the tips of brain cells. At Janelia Farm, the Virginia research campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, researchers are aiming for an understanding of the complete fly brain — a map of sorts, if a map can be taken to its imaginable limits, including structure, chemistry, genetics and activity. “I personally am inspired by what they’re doing at Janelia,” Dr. Reid said. All these efforts start with maps and enrich them. If Dr. Reid is successful, he and his colleagues will add what you might call the code of a brain process, the language the neurons use to store, transmit and process information for this function. Not that this would be any kind of final answer. In neuroscience, perhaps more than in most other disciplines, every discovery leads to new questions. “With the brain,” Dr. Reid said, “you can always go deeper.” ‘Psychoanalyst’s Kid Probes Brain!’ Dr. Reid, 53, grew up in Boston, in a family with deep roots in medicine. His grandfather taught physiology at Harvard Medical School. “My parents were both psychoanalysts,” he said during an interview last fall, smiling as he imagined a headline for this article, “Psychoanalyst’s Kid Probes Brain!” Advertisement “I pretty much always knew that I wanted to be a scientist,” he said. As an undergraduate at Yale, he majored in physics and philosophy and in mathematics, but in the end decided he didn’t want to be a physicist. Biology was attractive, but he was worried enough about his mathematical bent to talk to one of his philosophy professors about concerns that biology would too fuzzy for him. The professor had some advice. “You really should read Hubel and Wiesel,” he said, referring to David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who had just won the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their work showing how binocular vision develops in the brain. He read their work, and when he graduated in 1982, he was convinced that the study of the brain was both hard science and a wide-open field. He went on to an M.D.-Ph.D. program at Cornell Medical College and Rockefeller University, where Dr. Wiesel had his lab (he would go on to be president of Rockefeller). As his studies progressed, Dr. Reid began to have second thoughts about pursuing medicine rather than research. Just a week before he was to commit to a neurology residency, he said, “I ran into a friend from the Wiesel lab and said, ‘Save me.’ ” That plea led to postdoctoral research in the Rockefeller lab. He stayed as a faculty member until moving to Harvard in 1996. Advertisement Mathematics and physics were becoming increasingly important in neurobiology, a trend that has continued, but there was still a certain tension between different mind-sets, he recalled. He found that there were intangible skills involved in biological research. “Good biological intuition was equally important to chops in math and physics,” he said. “Torsten once said to me, ‘You know, Clay, science is not an intelligence test.’ ” Though he didn’t recall that specific comment, Dr. Wiesel said recently that it sounded like something he would have said. “I think there are a lot of smart people who never make it in science. Why is it? What is it that is required in addition?” Intuition is important, he said, “knowing what kind of questions to ask.” And, he said, “the other thing is a passion for getting to the core of the problem.” Advertisement Dr. Reid, he said, was not only smart and full of energy, but also “interested in asking questions that I think can get to the core of a problem.” At Harvard, Dr. Reid worked on the Connectome Project to map the connections between neurons in the mouse brain. The Connectome Project aims at a detailed map, a wiring diagram at a level fantastically more detailed than the work being done to map the human brain with M.R.I. machines. But electron microscopes produce a static picture from tiny slices of preserved brain. Dr. Reid began working on tying function to mapping. He and one of his graduate students, Davi Bock, now at Janelia Farm, linked studies of active mouse brains to the detailed structural images produced by electron microscopes. Dr. Bock said he recalled Dr. Reid as having developed exactly the kind of intuition and “good lab hands” that Dr. Wiesel seemed to be encouraging. He and another graduate student were stumped by a technical problem involving a new technique for studying living brains, and Dr. Reid came by. “Clay got on this bench piled up with components,” Dr. Bock said. “He started plugging and unplugging different power cables. We just stood there watching him, and I was sure he was going to scramble everything.” But he didn’t. Whatever he did worked. FEB. 24, 2014 That was part of the fun of working in the lab, Dr. Bock said, “not that he got it right every time.” But his appreciation for Dr. Reid as a leader and mentor went beyond admiration for his “mad scientist lab hands.” “He has a deep gut level enthusiasm for what’s beautiful and what’s profound in neuroscience, and he’s kind of relentless,” Dr. Bock said. Showing a Mouse a Picture That instinct, enthusiasm and relentlessness will be necessary for his current pursuit. To crack the code of the brain, Dr. Reid said, two fundamental problems must be solved. Advertisement The first is: “How does the machine work, starting with its building blocks, cell types, going through their physiology and anatomy,” he said. That means knowing all the different types of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and their function — information that science doesn’t have yet. It also means knowing what code is used to pass on information. When a mouse sees a picture, how is that picture encoded and passed from neuron to neuron? That is called neural computation. “The other highly related problem is: How does that neural computation create behavior?” he said. How does the mouse brain decide on action based on that input? He imagined the kind of experiment that would get at these deep questions. A mouse might be trained to participate in an experiment now done with primates in which an animal looks at an image. Later, seeing several different images in sequence, the animal presses a lever when the original one appears. Seeing the image, remembering it, recognizing it and pressing the lever might take as long as two seconds and involve activity in several parts of the brain. Understanding those two seconds, Dr. Reid said, would mean knowing “literally what photons hit the retina, what information does the retina send to the thalamus and the cortex, what computations do the neurons in the cortex do and how do they do it, how does that level of processing get sent up to a memory center and hold the trace of that picture over one or two seconds.” Then, when the same picture is seen a second time, “the hard part happens,” he said. “How does the decision get made to say, ‘That’s the one’?” In pursuit of this level of understanding, Dr. Reid and others are gathering chemical, electrical, genetic and other information about what the structure of that part of the mouse brain is and what activity is going on. They will develop electron micrographs that show every neuron and every connection in that part of a mouse brain. That is done on dead tissue. Then they will use several techniques to see what goes on in that part of the brain when a living animal reacts to different situations. “We can record the activity of every single cell in a volume of cortex, and capture the connections,” he said. Advertisement With chemicals added to the brain, the most advanced light microscopes can capture movies of neurons firing. Electrodes can record the electrical impulses. And mathematical analysis of all that may decipher the code in which information is moved around that part of the brain. Dr. Reid says solving the first part of the problem — receiving and analyzing sensory information — might be done in 10 years. An engineer’s precise understanding of everything from photons to action could be more on the order of 20 to 30 years away, and not reachable through the work of the Allen Institute alone. But, he wrote in an email, “the large-scale, coordinated efforts at the institute will get us there faster.” He is studying only one part of one animal’s brain, but, he said, the cortex — the part of the mammalian brain where all this calculation goes on — is something of a general purpose computer. So the rules for one process could explain other processes, like hearing. And the rules for decision-making could apply to many more complicated situations in more complicated brains. Perhaps the mouse visual cortex can be a kind of Rosetta stone for the brain’s code. All research is a gamble, of course, and the Allen Institute’s collaborative approach, while gaining popularity in neuroscience, is not universally popular. Dr. Wiesel said it was “an important approach” that would “provide a lot of useful information.” But, he added, “it won’t necessarily create breakthroughs in our understanding of how the brain works.” “I think the main advances are going to be made by individual scientists working in small groups,” he said. Of course, in courting and absorbing researchers like Dr. Reid, the Allen Institute has been moving away from its broad data-gathering approach toward more focused work by individual investigators. Dr. Bock, his former student, said his experience suggested that Dr. Reid had not only a passion and intensity for research, but a good eye for where science is headed as well. “That’s what Clay does,” he said. “He is really good in that Wayne Gretzky way of skating to where the puck will be.” The Map Makers: Second in a series of articles about scientists behind the new efforts to explore the brain.

Travel   An Inside Look at Cooking and Dining in Tel Aviv. Advertisement Six years ago, Tel Aviv tapped into its inner voyeur when it joined the international movement “Houses from Within,” a festival in which residents of some of the city’s most interesting (and opulent) homes fling open their doors and allow the public to visit. Now the city has created its own spin-off event, with some of Tel Aviv’s most prestigious chefs opening their kitchen doors and allowing snoops and snackers alike a chance to see the workings of a restaurant from the inside. Open Restaurants, which had a test run last July and will offer its first full-fledged event beginning Wednesday, includes kitchen sneak-peeks, culinary workshops and chef-guided tours of Tel Aviv’s open-air market. “We’re going to try to show you the restaurant from the inside, how we get our supplies here, how we cook it, and later of course, how we eat it,” said Orel Kimchi, chef and owner at Popina, one of the 70 restaurants hosting events over the four-day festival. On Mr. Kimchi’s docket for the event is a trip to the local fishmonger, spectators in tow, where he will purchase a fresh drum fish and then offer a master class on scaling it, filleting it and preparing it five ways. Other workshops include ice cream making, learning the science of pizza dough and a chance to peer into the kitchen during a frenzied service at theTel Aviv hot spot Brasserie. Workshops range from  50 shekels (about $15) to  300  shekels ($88), most in Hebrew with a select few offered in English. Reservations and more information are at open-restaurants.co.il.

Business   Anything Goes. Advertisement By Stanley Newman Feb 27, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE —#8212; Stanley Newman, the man behind today’s AMAZIN’ crossword, has created a theme set “in a neighborhood bar,” in which four answers together form a sentence you might hear at a local tavern. The sort of place where everybody knows your name — and everyone’s a gossip. Solve the puzzle and you’ll see what I mean. Some answers came as easy as LAY UPS while others took PLENTY of time. The bartender MOE was a gimme (at least for us Simpsons fanatics) and a welcome way to make inroads into the northern half of the puzzle — leading to entries like ENAMEL and FAKE. But the more esoteric clues took quite a while. The enigmatic 2 Down (“formed, as schoolyard teams, say”) was one of the first clues that I read but it was the last that I solved. Did it take anybody else a long time to figure out CHOSE UP? This puzzle also asks a question about the Summer Games, keeping the Olympic spirit going just days after the conclusion of the Sochi festivities. The clue at 37 Down asks for the “locale of three Summer Olympics,” and the answer Stanley is looking for is broader than just a city — it is the whole continent of ASIA, home to the host cities of Tokyo (1964), Seoul (1988) and Beijing (2008). Stanley has a lot to say about his construction, so I’ll let him have a word. Inspiration for this puzzle came from my 30-year-old son Marc (whom Will bounced on his knee at my home about 27 years ago), who sells items on eBay for his London office-salvage business. One of his recent items was a plaque with the theme message, for which only the original WE’LL needed to be changed to WE WILL to break perfectly. By dumb luck, Will was short of non-rebus Thursdays, so it appears today only 19 days after he OK’d it. I clue puzzles hard by having as many “new” clues as possible, requiring some thought and reasoning to solve, rather than ones that can be solved at sight by solvers with good memories. Most of the new factual clues here come from Internet research, such as 52A, 63A, 8D and 34D. An added requirement to my harder clues is that only general knowledge should be required to understand them, even if the fact itself isn’t well-known. For example, anyone from New York should know that AMAZIN (14A) is associated with the Mets, so it shouldn’t be surprising that a website all about the Mets is called Amazin’ Avenue. One other clue nicety here that might not be obvious: a factual balance between new pop culture (like 18A, 55A), older (40A, 25D), and historical (42A, 10D). I made sure that all my factual references could be quickly and authoritatively verified with Google, and passed that info along to Will with the puzzle. While some my new clues for uncapitalized answers also come from Web research (“Time-stretching” for 41D SLO-MO came from a Wikipedia article), I can often think of something fresh by just letting my mind wander. That’s where I got 56A and 1D, for instance. Will is obviously onboard with all of this thinking, since he kept about three-quarters of my clues, including all the ones cited above. In the 1,000-plus crosswords I’ve constructed and the 5,000-plus I’ve edited (for the New York newspaper Newsday and PuzzleSocial.com) since adopting Crossword Compiler in 2000, I’ve found that with careful grid patterning it’s never necessary to use obscurities, even for wide-open grids such as the 72-worder here. This sometimes requires that I check Google News and Google Books, to be sure that words I think are in common current use actually are. I look forward to the day where this fussiness will be standard procedure for constructors, so we can finally bid the OLEOs, OLIOs and ANILs of crosswordese an unfond farewell.

Foreign   Pushing for a Law Against Domestic Violence in China. Advertisement Last Thanksgiving, Kim Lee came down the stairs in her apartment in Beijing to see her former husband, Li Yang, standing in the living room. “I screamed,” she said. The couple had divorced nine months earlier in a blaze of publicity, after Mr. Li, the celebrity founder of Crazy English, a language school they ran together, admitted to physically abusing his American wife. Chinese women rarely publicize violence at the hands of their partners, but Ms. Lee posted images of her injuries online. Her forthrightness won her praise from women’s advocates as well as many ordinary Chinese, though some reacted with fury at how she lifted the lid on a sensitive topic. Ms. Lee’s experiences since then, however, have bolstered activists’ arguments that China is in urgent need of a national law on domestic violence. In interviews, Ms. Lee, a teacher, said that after they separated in 2011, Mr. Li more than once threatened her in text messages. “For our kids, you’d better pay attention to your safety!!!” read one message, she said. Another: “You need me to beat you again to make you better, you greedy, American psycho.” Mr. Li was “very busy” and would not respond to a detailed question list or otherwise comment, said his assistant, Anson Ke. So on her divorce, Ms. Lee applied for, and was granted, a protection order, the first reported in Beijing. The court order was for only three months and not detailed, simply warning Mr. Li that he would be arrested if he resorted to violence against her again. “But it did in fact protect me,” Ms. Lee said in an interview. Once he threatened to beat her to death, she reminded him that he could go to jail and he backed off, she said. “What it does is take out that painful step of having to get evidence” of an attack, which includes getting a hospital report and persuading the police to file a report, something difficult to do. “I just report the violence, and he’s dealt with,” she said. Last May, however, the order expired. And since then, despite multiple applications to the court, she has been unable to secure another. Activists say her situation illustrates why laws are needed that would define domestic violence, nixing the common argument that it is a “private matter,” raising the problem in the public eye, giving courts, the police, hospitals and other social organizations a clear legal mandate to assist victims, and standardizing important measures like protection orders. Some, issued elsewhere in the country, have ordered the perpetrator to keep a distance from the victim, but the approach is piecemeal. Currently, the Marriage Law and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women outlaw domestic violence, but they are vague, activists say. “There are too many systemic problems, too many loopholes. It’s just too easy to do it,” said Feng Yuan, a leading feminist and a founder of the Anti-Domestic Violence Network, which has campaigned for a comprehensive law for 15 years. Figures of the scale of the problem vary. Last year, Tan Lin, an official at the All-China Women’s Federation, said that 25 percent of women experienced violence in their marriage. But a study last year by Partners for Prevention, a United Nations program, found that 52 percent of about 1,000 Chinese men told researchers that they had been violent toward a woman. And protection orders, considered a crucial method of combating domestic violence worldwide, are still experimental in China. Courts try to keep them quiet, concerned that without the authority of a law and an established system of practical enforcement, they may fail, and the court may lose face, feminists say. Only recently did activists discover that another order was issued in Beijing several months before Ms. Lee’s. “Ms. Lee’s problems show that China needs to formalize protection orders,” said Ms. Feng. Because when it comes to violent partners issuing threats, “there is no law that says that judges must solve this problem.” “The courts are afraid of being overrun by applicants and of being unable to enforce the orders and therefore becoming a mockery, with the police not cooperating,” she said. In 2012, the National People’s Congress took proposals for a law defining and outlawing domestic violence into its legislative program. Every year, there have been a few deputies who try to push it forward. But after 15 years of lobbying, activists like Ms. Feng believe it’s still very low on the government’s agenda. “A lot of people trivialize the problem, but it’s not a trivial thing,” Ms. Feng said. Many countries, including in Asia, have such a law, making China a laggard. In China, action is “too slow,” she said. “It’s just too, too slow!” This year, feminists are gearing up to lobby again at the congress, which convenes next week. In 2003, the network submitted a draft law. Later, the All-China Women’s Federation, a government body, also submitted one. Ms. Feng does not expect a law this year. Maybe next year, if things move fast, she said. And 2015 is the 20th anniversary of the United Nations’ Fourth World Conference on Women, a landmark event held in Beijing that declared: “Women’s rights are human rights.” Despite the sense of urgency she and other women’s advocates feel, she says it’s important to get a good law, even if it takes time. “The question now is, How will they draft it? What are their priorities?” Ms. Feng said. Would, for example, protection orders be part of it? With the legislative process in China largely a black box, feminists can only hope to exert indirect influence. “We don’t have formal lobbyists like in the United States,” Ms. Feng said. She singled out three groups of people to approach: state leaders, heads of departments involved in drafting laws, and researchers and expert advisers. As a civil society organization, the network lacks access to the first group and only rarely can influence the second, but it can reach the third. The women’s federation has access to the first two; its leader, Shen Yueyue, is also a state leader. It comes down to a question of political will, said Ms. Feng. “I’d say there are just a handful of groups willing to pursue this issue.” Meanwhile, absent court protection and a law spelling out the crime, Ms. Lee worries. “He entered my home in the middle of the night,” she said. “I felt this was enough to warrant another application, since he obviously keeps threatening, scaring and trying to pressure me.” Her latest application was turned down on Dec. 23. She says she will keep trying.

Science   Test Is Improved Predictor of Fetal Disorders Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement A test that analyzes fetal DNA found in a pregnant woman’s blood proved much more accurate in screening for Down syndrome and another chromosomal disorder than the now-standard blood test, a new study has found. The promising results may change how prenatal screening for genetic diseases is done, though the test is costly and generally not yet covered by insurance for women at low risk. The study, published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the fetal DNA test was 10 times better in predicting cases of Down syndrome than the standard blood test and ultrasound screening, and five times better in predicting the other disorder, Trisomy 18. It also greatly reduced the number of false-positive results. It could prevent many women who would otherwise get the standard blood test from needing to confirm positive results with invasive tests like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, which can be stressful, much more costly and carry small risks of miscarriage. “Nine out of 10 women who are currently being referred for further testing would not need invasive tests,” said the lead author of the study, Dr. Diana Bianchi, the executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center’s Floating Hospital for Children. A positive result on the DNA screening would still need to be confirmed with invasive tests, because in more than half the cases in which the newer test predicted a disorder, there was no chromosomal abnormality. But a negative result would provide confidence that these two major chromosomal disorders are absent. “It’s a better mousetrap, there’s no doubt about that,” said Dr. Michael Greene, director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of an editorial about the study. “If the test is normal, the overwhelming probability is that your fetus is normal. There will be far fewer women who will be encouraged to have invasive testing, and, as a result, far fewer miscarriages.” The screen analyzes blood from women who are at least 10 weeks pregnant. At that point, about 10 percent of DNA in the blood will be fetal DNA from the placenta, Dr. Bianchi said. Dr. Bianchi is a paid advisory board member for Illumina, one of the laboratories that performs the test, which is known as the cell-free DNA test because the fetal DNA floats freely in the mother’s blood, not inside a cell. Illumina, which is based in San Diego, financed the study. Dr. Greene, an associate editor at The New England Journal of Medicine, said that the study “would sort of be purer from an academic perspective if somebody else pays for it,” but that companies are “the ones that are going to finance the research to get it to where it’s marketable.” He added, “We can’t have our cake and eat it too.” He said the journal had rejected other cell-free DNA studies, but considered this one well done. Experts said they expected the test would ultimately be offered to all pregnant women, but noted limitations. The test, costing $500 to $2,000, is not now typically covered by insurance for women at low risk for having babies with chromosomal abnormalities. Nor is it regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, because it is considered “laboratory developed,” to be used by the lab that created them and not sold to other labs or companies, Dr. Greene said. The test also appears to work inconsistently in very obese women. And it screens only for major chromosomal disorders and some sex-linked diseases. “This is a very good screening test for what it’s designed to screen for,” said Dr. Ignatia B. Van den Veyver, a prenatal geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine. But, she added, “we’re concerned that if women stop there, they miss the opportunity to have a diagnostic test like amnio that can detect other chromosomal abnormalities.” For now, this new technology, which became available in 2011, is primarily used for women deemed more likely to have babies with abnormalities because they are age 35 or older or have other risk factors. At least four companies offer the tests. Medical organizations have not recommended them for other women because of a lack of data showing they work in the general population. The new study, which involved 1,914 pregnant women from diverse backgrounds at 21 medical sites around the country, is the first large study to evaluate the cell-free DNA screen in average American women. Most women in the study were younger than 30, had conceived naturally, and were pregnant with their first child. Dr. Deborah A. Driscoll, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research, said that given this new evidence, “this should be a test that we can offer women universally.” The women received standard screening from their doctors, a blood test that identifies proteins or other biological markers associated with chromosomal disorders. Some also got ultrasounds examining the fetus’s neck for fluid associated with Down syndrome. Separately, and without knowing the results of the standard tests, technicians at the Illumina lab screened samples of the women’s blood for three copies of chromosomes instead of the normal two, seeking to identify chromosomes for Down syndrome, and for Trisomies 18 and 13, often fatal disorders. Researchers later checked whether babies were born with or without these conditions. In the study, the rate of false positives for Down syndrome was 0.3 percent with the cell-free DNA screening, while the rate for standard screening was 3.6 percent, 12 times higher. The false-positive rate for Trisomy 18 was 0.2 percent with the DNA screening; the rate with standard screening was three times that. Not everyone received standard screens for Trisomy 13, so complete comparisons could not be made. The DNA screen was correct in predicting Down syndrome 45.5 percent of the time, while the rate for standard screens was 4.2 percent. The DNA screen accurately predicted babies with Trisomy 18 almost 41 percent of the time, five times better than standard screening, whose rate was 8 percent. The cell-free DNA screen worked equally well in first, second or third trimesters, and in high- and low-risk women.” Since positive tests are often wrong, women should get positive findings verified with amniocentesis or C.V.S., experts aid. “The greatest risk is that the test will be oversold or over-interpreted and that women won’t take the step of an invasive diagnostic procedure before they do something irreversible like terminate a pregnancy,” Dr. Greene said. In the study, one of the five fetuses with Down syndrome was aborted, one of two with Trisomy 18 was stillborn, and the sole fetus with Trisomy 13 died in utero. The other five chromosomally abnormal babies were born alive. Jennifer Fontaine, 29, of Groveland, Mass., was not in the study, but chose cell-free DNA screening last year after standard screening showed an elevated risk of Trisomy 18 in her fetus. She was offered amniocentesis, but she said, “I wanted the noninvasive procedure.” Her DNA screen was negative for Trisomy 18, and her daughter, Morgan, was born healthy.

Sports   DeRozan’s Late Run Leads Raptors Over the Cavaliers. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSFEB. 25, 2014 DeMar DeRozan scored 16 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter, and the visiting Toronto Raptors won for the sixth time in seven games, defeating the injury-riddled Cleveland Cavaliers, 99-93, on Tuesday night. Terrence Ross hit a 3-pointer with 3 minutes 2 seconds left to put Toronto ahead by a point. DeRozan dunked on a baseline drive and added two free throws to give the Raptors a 94-91 lead with 1:23 remaining. He hit three more free throws in the final 27 seconds to put away the game. Kyrie Irving had 25 points and 9 assists for the Cavaliers. He played 45 minutes, including the entire second half, because of Cleveland’s depleted roster. The Cavaliers played without center Anderson Varejao (back) and guards Dion Waiters (knee) and C. J. Miles (ankle). BULLS 107, HAWKS 103 Mike Dunleavy scored 22 points, Joakim Noah had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and visiting Chicago held off Atlanta.

Travel   Lego Pieces Together a New Act. Advertisement While the thought of 3 million Legos may have parents instinctively rubbing the soles of their feet, executives at the Legoland park in Carlsbad, Calif., are smiling. They’ve used as many plastic pieces to create the Lego Movie Experience, a new attraction at the park that capitalizes on the recent success of Warner Brothers’ “The Lego Movie,” which has topped box office sales in its first two weekends and is quickly approaching the $200 million mark in domestic sales, according to Box Office Mojo. With assistance from filmmakers, the park’s master model builder team has recreated Middle Zealand, the Old West, Cloud Cuckooland, the Octane Tower and more than a thousand other models that inspired the story of the animated movie, in which Emmet, an average Lego figure, is mistakenly drafted to help save the world from an evil tyrant. The models, built using 91 new, rare, discontinued and current Lego sets, took more than 2,000 hours to assemble at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank and another six weeks to reassemble in the park. The walk-through attraction also features a soundstage broadcasting interviews with actors from the movie, including Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, along with clips from the film. Costumed characters from the movie also roam the area to take pictures with guests. Sets to build at home are sure to be on sale nearby.

Business   Turn Up the Music. Advertisement By Martin Ashwood-Smith Feb 28, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle from Martin Ashwood-Smith may be themeless, but it still has a fair number of references to music. We have HIGH NOTES soaring at the opera with 23 Across, the Hungarian composer known as ABBE Liszt at 43 Across and the pop singer AARON CARTER at 27 Down. It’s an all-out random grab bag of musical styles. There’s even a clue about a FLAUTIST. That particular musician, honored with a spot at 28 Down, is Sir James Galway, and it is noteworthy that his name is the second occurrence of the word “Galway” today. The other comes at 1 Down, with the clue “From Galway, maybe” for IRISH. This puzzle won me over, as the good ones always do, with smart clues. There’s QED for “Last thing seen by a proofreader” and “Text with Numbers” for TORAH. But my favorite had to be “Carlito’s way,” breaking out of the Italian with VIA. The toughest and most rewarding parts of the grid were the daunting 15-letter answers in the middle, and Martin, our constructor, has something to say about that. Who needs indie puzzles with their fancy new phrases and risqué words, when you can get a delightful disease-oriented 15-letter entry like MALARIA PARASITE in one of my New York Times crosswords?

Foreign   Questioning a Rising Star's Exoneration. Advertisement Advertisement By MANU JOSEPHFEB. 27, 2014 NEW DELHI — A “clean chit,” in most of the English-speaking world, may bring to mind a blank piece of paper of inexplicable purpose. But in India it very clearly means the exoneration of a public figure by an investigating agency. Probably the most famous “clean chit” was issued last year by a special investigation team to Narendra Modi, clearing the way for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party to nominate him — days before the advent of an inauspicious period in the Hindu calendar — as its prime ministerial candidate for the general elections due this summer. The team, appointed by the Supreme Court, had investigated the allegations that Mr. Modi was complicit in the communal riots of 2002 in the western state of Gujarat, in which more than a thousand people were killed. He was then, as he is now, the state’s chief minister. The manner in which the team and its chief, R.K. Raghavan, a retired police officer, conducted the investigation has been contentious. Now, a book by the journalist Manoj Mitta, “The Fiction of Fact-Finding,” accuses Mr. Raghavan of going to great lengths to shield Mr. Modi and of ignoring a wide spectrum of disturbing circumstantial evidence. One of the intriguing revelations of the book is the approximate time when Mr. Modi, according to his own statement to the investigation team, learned of one of the worst massacres in his state. On the morning of Feb. 28, 2002, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’s largest city, a Hindu mob began to gather around Gulbarg Society, an affluent, mostly Muslim neighborhood. Fearing for their lives, scores of Muslims took shelter in the home of Ehsan Jafri, a former member of Parliament from the Indian National Congress party. Emboldened by an absence of any substantive police action, a common feature in the first days of the Gujarat riots, the mob began to attack. Even though the buildup and the attack spanned more than six hours and Mr. Jafri called a number of influential people for help, no help arrived. By 3 or 4 p.m., 69 people had died in the assault, including Mr. Jafri, who was hacked to pieces and burned. Advertisement Mr. Modi told the team he only learned of the episode “in the law and order review meeting held in the night.” That was at 8:30 p.m. Mr. Mitta is baffled that the investigation team did not challenge this claim. The Gujarat riots erupted after a horrific episode on the morning of Feb. 27, when a train compartment carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned by a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra. Fifty-eight people perished. Hours later, a low-level government officer, on instructions from his superiors — though it is not yet clear how high the chain went — wrote an unusual letter. It approved the transfer of most of the charred human remains to Jaydeep Patel, then a joint general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or V.H.P., a rightist Hindu organization that would soon be at the center of the attacks against Muslims. The handover was illegal because, by law, only the families of the deceased may take custody of the bodies. Also, not all the bodies had yet been identified. Against the advice of senior police officers, Mr. Modi cleared the transfer of the bodies from Godhra to Ahmedabad, which was already tense and had a history of communal violence. The next day, some of the bodies were carried in a procession by the V.H.P., an event that attracted huge angry mobs that would soon unleash unspeakable violence. Mr. Modi told the investigation team that he did not know the bodies were handed over to the V.H.P., which is actually a sibling of his own party. The two groups are affiliated with the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, to which Mr. Modi still belongs. Mobile phone records among the court documents point to close coordination between government officials and the V.H.P. in the hours after the burning of the train. Yet Mr. Mitta says the investigation team did not pursue these leads. When I contacted Mr. Raghavan he declined to comment. Since the riots, Mr. Modi’s political power has risen dramatically among the Hindu electorate of Gujarat. In this reward lies, inadvertently, his indictment.

In Room 113, Jonathan Barnbrook has created a large-scale piece inspired by neoclassical Victorian typography, above, while the walls of Suites 533 and 534 are hung with Justine Ashbee’s woven textiles in simple geometric patterns. The three artists, and nearly 100 others, were commissioned by the hotel to create pieces for each of the guest rooms and the public spaces. The work ranges from typography and photography to painting and street art, and will no doubt further the reputation of Ace hotels as trendy hangouts for the MacBook-toting urban creative class. It may also bring some positive coverage for the East London outpost. Months after it opened last September, a founder of the boutique hotel chain, Alex Calderwood, was found dead in one of the rooms. Information: acehotel.com/london.

Science   Ask Well: Medicines for Motion Sickness Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement A look at the drugs — some used by astronauts — that can relieve car, sea and space nausea. Reader Question • 608 votes It’s not a new medicine, but Dr. John P. Carey of Johns Hopkins University often recommends the scopolamine patch to his patients. The patch, sold under the brand name Transderm Scop, requires a prescription, and works by blocking brain signals that cause queasiness. The patch is placed behind the ear, where it slowly releases medication into the blood. This slow release helps minimize side effects, which can include drowsiness and dry mouth and other problems. NASA astronauts use the same medication, but because they need the drug to work at warp speed, they take it orally, as a pill. NASA is developing a nasal-spray version of the drug as well. Antihistamines can also be effective in curbing motion sickness. Common drugs in this class include dimenhydrinate (known as Dramamine) and meclizine (known as Bonine). Both are available over the counter. A prescription antihistamine favored by astronauts is promethazine (sold under such brands as Phenergan, Phenadoz and Promethegan), commonly given by injection for rapid relief of symptoms. In fact, it was an allergist who in 1947 discovered that Dramamine was effective against motion sickness. When he used the drug to treat a patient with hives, she was also cured of chronic motion sickness. The doctor then began a program called Operation Seasickness. He convinced the United States Army to test the effects of Dramamine on soldiers sailing to Germany aboard the transport ship General Ballou. Of the 389 soldiers who took the drug, 372 found their motion sickness disappear. But it’s important to keep in mind that Dramamine and Bonine are known to cause drowsiness, dry mouth and other side effects. Do you have a health question? Submit your question to Ask Well.

Sports   Super Rugby Expands Into Argentina. Advertisement Advertisement By EMMA STONEYFEB. 26, 2014 WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Starting in 2016, Argentina will get what it wanted: its own Super Rugby franchise, and a tighter bond with the heavyweight rugby nations in the Southern Hemisphere. Sanzar, the organization that runs the Rugby Championship competition and Super Rugby, announced last Thursday that it would be expanding from 15 to 17 teams, adding its first in South America. South Africa has also been guaranteed a sixth team, likely to be the Southern Kings, who were involved in Super Rugby in 2013 but lost out to the Lions for inclusion this year. Currently there are five franchises each in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, the countries that make up Sanzar. The expansion of Super Rugby into Argentina follows its admittance into the well-established Tri-Nations competition, which was relabeled the Rugby Championship when the Pumas joined the annual Sanzar tournament in 2012. The former Pumas halfback Agustin Pichot was the driving force behind getting Argentina into the Rugby Championship and has been in the forefront of negotiations for Super Rugby inclusion, also. Advertisement The Sanzar chief Greg Peters said it was the logical step to take. “It’s a natural extension from their involvement in the Rugby Championship,” he said. “It makes logical strategic sense to include them in both of the Sanzar competitions.” The exact format of the new competition has yet to be confirmed, although a “preferred model” has been submitted for approval to South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The expansion has not been universally accepted, however. Some coaches and players, who already travel huge distances for games, are worried that adding Argentina to the mix will affect their workload and performance. But the expansion will certainly open up greater opportunities for Argentina’s players and raise the standard of rugby played in that country — and played by the Pumas. Argentina’s players now have to leave their home country to secure professional contracts. The majority play in France and Britain. Only a few have played Super Rugby. Two Pumas, Tomás Leonardi and Nicolás Vergallo, played for the Southern Kings last year, while in 2009 Juan Martín Hernández signed with the Sharks, another South African franchise, but a back injury kept him out of Super Rugby in 2010. This year, Pumas lock Manuel Carizza is playing for the Stormers in South Africa, while Matias Diaz is the first Argentinean to play in New Zealand after signing a deal with the Highlanders. “A professional franchise in Argentina would be a dream come true for many of us — mainly from the point of view of the success of the national team,” said Carizza, who has played 41 tests for Argentina and spent nine years in France at the Top 14 clubs Biarritz and Racing Metro before moving to South Africa. “Personally, I am very happy here and still want to establish myself in the Stormers team and Super Rugby. But, with the bigger picture in mind, a Super Rugby franchise back home would mean a lot for our rugby.” Advertisement Playing in Super Rugby would also mean there are no clashes between their club commitments and international rugby. Argentines who are selected for the Pumas in the Rugby Championship are unavailable for their clubs at the start of the Top 14, English Premiership or Pro 12 Celtic League season, and team owners are becoming increasingly unhappy about that. It is one of the reasons Carizza headed to South Africa. “Racing Metro didn’t want to keep me, due to my international commitments,” he said. “I went back home for the Rugby Championship with the intention of looking for a new contract after the tournament. The Stormers were the first Super Rugby franchise to look at me, and I didn’t have to think twice about signing with them.” Diaz is a young prop embarking on professional rugby for the first time. He turned down offers from clubs in Europe to make the move to the Highlanders after making his Pumas debut last year. “I’m happy with the decision I made to put my professional career first before the money, because I had other offers from clubs that offered me more money,” said the 21-year-old, who played for Teqüe, a club in Mendoza, Argentina. “But I’ve made the best decision because I’m improving a lot as a rugby player here. I believe Super Rugby is the best place to start my professional career. It’s the highest standard you can get in rugby.” Enticing players like Diaz and Carizza, along with those whose French contracts are expiring in 2015, to return to Argentina for Super Rugby will be crucial if the new team is to be competitive. But Peters does not expect to see the entire Pumas national team suiting up in the Argentine franchise’s Super Rugby jerseys. “I don’t think that’s either likely or realistic,” he said. “There will still be players who are playing in Europe who play for the Pumas. Carizza, though, believes many Argentines will be eager to play on home soil. “I think all of our players would love to play Super Rugby,” said the lock, who made his Super Rugby debut last weekend. “For the last 15 years, the top Pumas players have gone to France because it’s easier and there’s always been a history of our players playing professional rugby in Europe. Advertisement “Now with Argentina playing in the Rugby Championship, it would make it easier or more viable for our top players to also play Super Rugby and, at the same time, represent their national team.” Diaz, who also made his Super Rugby debut over the weekend, hopes that if he is successful at the Highlanders, his countrymen will be further encouraged to play Super Rugby. “I know people are watching me and what I’m doing,” said Diaz, who was inspired to play rugby when the Pumas finished third at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. “I’m pleased because I’m working really hard to be a good example for anyone who wants to follow my path. “I don’t feel pressure because I’m the first from Argentina to play in New Zealand. I put pressure on myself to give my best for my team. I realize that this is one opportunity in life and I need to do my best.” A version of this article appears in print on February 27, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Travel   New Butler Services Buff Luxury Hotels. Advertisement In the race for an increasingly personalized luxury hotel experience, the butler may be the ultimate amenity. Since January, the new Langham, Chicago has employed a rotating staff of eight dedicated butlers for its three club floors. Carlos Carrera, the director of butler services for the hotel, said that the new generation of butlers specializes in services like unpacking and pressing and arranging daily details like dinner reservations and child care. At the Langham, the service costs an extra $75 per person daily for those on the club floors, where rooms are $470 to $1,500 per night. The hotel’s Infinity and Regent Suites, which go for $6,000 a night, include 24-hour butler service. At the St. Regis Hotels, the butler has morphed into a personal assistant. In a new initiative at the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in Florida, guests can request to have their closets stocked with clothing and accessories to try from Neiman Marcus. The butler then serves as a kind of personal shopper. “Our butlers today are more Pepper Potts in ‘Iron Man’ than Alfred Pennyworth in ‘Batman,’ ” said Anthony Ingham, the vice president of North American brand management for St. Regis Hotels and Resorts. About 40 percent of the butlers at St. Regis properties are women, he said. And, in a nod to a connected world, guests and butlers can communicate before, during and after a stay via eButler, the hotel’s dedicated online platform. Charles MacPherson, the owner of an eponymous academy for butlers and household managers and whose new book, “The Butler Speaks,” offers etiquette and entertaining tips, said he believes that even crusty Mr. Carson, the character on the series “Downton Abbey,” would approve of eButlers. “In person or electronically, the butler’s job is to personalize the guest experience and build a relationship of trust,” he said.

Business   High Tech. Advertisement By Ian Livengood & J.A.S.A. Crossword Class Mar 1, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE— This Saturday puzzle was a collaborative effort constructed by Ian Livengood and the crossword class at the J.A.S.A. (or Jewish Association Serving the Aging). Down below, Ian talks a bit about what the class does and what their creative process is like. What makes this puzzle stand out are the many technology-themed clues and answers. It gets started with a clue reading “Samsung Galaxy Note rival,” referring to the IPAD AIR, which the tech-savvy can use to RETWEET stories about GOOGLE GLASS. I particularly enjoyed the clue for that last one, which plays off the multiple meanings of the word bridge. Other high-tech elements at play include a radar SENSOR, an ADWARE detector and a nod to the carrier T MOBILE. Even the Hubble telescope gets a shout-out. Alongside all these, we have an example of texting shorthand that, to the untrained eye, looks like imparsable jibberish: KTHXBYE for “curt chat closing” at 18 Across. Its unusual combination of letters makes it tricky to spot. The crossers helped me fill in some of the blanks, but I started to second-guess myself when faced with the alien-looking “K–X–YE.” It makes you realize that, out of context, these abbreviations look like another language. Which is not to say that this puzzle has anything against foreign languages. From BIENVENUE to ARTE to ACH (nicht verdammt!), this puzzle is anything but monolingual. Even some of the English clues have a distinctly a worldly feel: Turkish LIRA, PAD THAI, double-decker buses, Italian PERONI, you name it. Now let’s hear from Ian: How does the J.A.S.A. crossword class work? Well, I suggested a few seed entries for the themeless puzzle — GOOGLE GLASS and IPAD AIR — and designed a conservative 72-word grid around ’em. The class then collaborated on the fill and clues. With the exception of ATAVIST (which isn’t even that bad), all the 7+ letter entries are either good to great, I think. A lot of our clues made the cut, too. I bet this puzzle plays easy if you know your tech products and almost certainly got slotted for a Saturday based on K THX BYE. Enjoy!

Science   The Pasta Is Gluten-Free Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   Every so often I like to do a small roundup of gluten-free pasta products, to see if there is anything new and noteworthy on the market. This week was a good time to do it, as I’m in New York staying with my sister Melodie, who is gluten-intolerant. Melodie used to eat a lot of rice pasta until she became concerned with reports about arsenic in rice. It is cold in New York and we are mourning the death of our 95-year-old mother, and this calls for comfort food. So I went shopping for gluten-free pasta that was not made primarily with rice flour, and put my purchases to good use. Those purchases, by the way, were not cheap. The best price I could get (at Whole Foods) for one of the brands I liked the most, Andean Dream Quinoa Spaghetti (when you look closely at the ingredients you’ll see that it is made from a mix of quinoa and brown rice) was $3.50 for an 8-ounce package. Another brand I liked, truRoots Ancient Grain Spaghetti, made from quinoa, amaranth and brown rice, was $4.79 for an 8-ounce package. (I saw the same products at other shops for as much as $5.) I can get regular spaghetti for $1 to $1.69 a pound. So if you are on a budget, the gluten-free pastas I worked with this week will be splurges. I also tried cornmeal fettucine made by Le Veneziane ($3.99 for 8.8 ounces) and thought it was quite good. Brown-rice penne rigate by Delallo was also good, but I found the texture more brittle and stodgy than the other varieties. I think the shape is an important element here. Spaghetti had the best al dente texture of all the shapes, followed by fettucine. Gluten-Free Fettucine With Brussels Sprouts, Lemon and Ricotta: Creamy ricotta and Brussels sprouts add color and texture to this dish. Quinoa Spaghetti With Cauliflower, Almonds, Tomatoes and Chickpeas: Cauliflower is often matched with pasta in Italy; this version is all about texture. Gluten-Free Spaghetti With Baby Broccoli, Mushrooms and Walnuts: The walnuts add texture and flavor to this pasta dish. Gluten-Free Penne With Peas, Ricotta and Tarragon: A simple dish that is sweet with tarragon and a breeze to make. Gluten-Free Spaghetti With Shrimp, Kale and Tomatoes: A robust winter pasta with a spicy kick. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Sports   Not Just One, but 3 Weapons for Real Madrid. Advertisement Advertisement By ROB HUGHESFEB. 27, 2014 LONDON — How the wheel turns in the Champions League. Real Madrid wore golden orange and struck six goals against Schalke in Germany. Cristiano Ronaldo looked imperious and scored twice. Karim Benzema looked predatory and scored twice. Gareth Bale looked no longer the new boy — and scored twice. And Ronaldo, particularly, might have had more. Madrid might have scored 10. And it is that number — la décima, as it is known — that has obsessed the club ever since May 2002, when Real won its ninth, and last, final in the tournament. Eleven coaching changes and a turnover of more than a billion dollars’ worth of playing talent has ensued since then. Always the quest has been la décima. Always the president of Real Madrid, Florentino Pérez, has justified the spending and the impatience for this title. Based on this year’s form, Bayern Munich would be the one power capable of standing in Real’s way. But in destroying Schalke on Wednesday night, Madrid exorcised some of its demons about playing on German soil. “I’m satisfied,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Italian coach of Real Madrid, said at the postgame news conference, once the 6-1 victory in Gelsenkirchen ended. “That was the perfect game. My players played with togetherness, and they played well. We weren’t thinking of our bad run in Germany, we were thinking about giving absolutely everything to win and resolve this tie as soon as possible.” Advertisement And Ancelotti arched an eyebrow. That is as animated as he gets, this man who has won the Champions League twice as a player and twice as a manager with A.C. Milan. Down the corridor in Gelsenkirchen, where Real had laid bare its record of winning only once in 25 previous Champions League matches in Germany, Bale, the new recruit to this strike force, was asked by reporters how it felt to be in this lineup. He said his earliest memory of the Champions League was watching Zinédine Zidane score against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final. That goal must have impressed countless boys just about to enter their teens, as Bale was at that time. It was a volley struck with startling power and sweetness — a volley with the ball at hip height when the ball approached him across his body from the left. Down in Wales, where Bale was growing up, the sight of that goal was an inspiration and an invitation to work harder than ever on his own skills. To one day join Real Madrid and to be coached by Zidane — who is now Ancelotti’s assistant — rounds out the dream. To then form the attack with Ronaldo and Benzema is beyond his boyhood imagination. “Our attacking trio,” said the master of understatement, Ancelotti, “are very dangerous.” Dangerous? They are devastating. Schalke is a decent side, fourth in the Bundesliga, which we were told last year was the new force that would dominate Europe for years to come. But Schalke is a young side, a vulnerable one and now a chastened one. Advertisement “Cristiano Ronaldo was everywhere,” said Benedikt Höwedes, the Schalke captain at the postgame briefing. “We saw exactly why he’s the world player of the year.” Indeed, Ronaldo was unplayable at times. The four (or was it five?) step-overs he made with bewildering speed and control during the run for his first goal were eclipsed by the gliding, graceful movement of his second. He also struck a post and missed twice. Yet it was the combinations from Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale that blitzed Schalke throughout this match. Reports say that Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s goal right at the end for Schalke was more than a match for any of the Real strikes. And it was. Huntelaar beat Iker Casillas with a volley in added time that was as perfect in many ways as the Zidane goal of 2002. It was uninhibited and excellent, but a consolation against a majestic opponent that by then was thinking of its next game, Sunday’s Madrid derby against Atlético in the Vicente Calderón Stadium. In the other match, the first leg of Galatasaray versus Chelsea was played to a 1-1 tie in Istanbul on Wednesday. It was a contest built around the intrigue of Gala’s center forward, Didier Drogba, competing against many of the Chelsea teammates with whom he shared the 2012 Champions League title. Drogba is still good and still athletic for a man in his mid-thirties. He has the guile and the know-how but is playing on experience rather than the power that he could once summon. Take sentiment out of it, and what was clear is that the Ivory Coast player is on his last lap. By the time he left the field, to an ovation from the Chelsea bench with 10 minutes left, the game was tied, 1-1. It finished that way, and so now everyone is talking up the return of Drogba to Stamford Bridge, where this contest must be settled. The odds favor the London side. They did what they had to in Turkey, aided and abetted by a gamble by Galatasaray Coach Roberto Mancini. Advertisement Seeking to surprise Chelsea, he fielded two Champions League rookies in Izet Hajrovic, a 22-year-old Bosnian, and Alex Telles, a 21-year-old Brazilian. By the time Hajrovic was taken out half way through the first half, Gala was a goal down. Emmanuel Eboué lost the ball to César Azpilicueta, who combined with Andre Schürrle down the left wing before cutting the ball back into the six-yard box for a comfortable side-footed goal by Fernando Torres. So open was Gala’s defense that Chelsea could have scored more. But once Mancini changed tactics, the balance swung in the other direction, and Galatasaray’s big Cameroon defender, Aurélien Chedjou, equalized following a corner kick. Where was Chelsea’s defense? John Terry and goalkeeper Petr Cech were possibly looking for a threat that wasn’t there — for Drogba — while Chedjou was left unmarked.

Travel   Wine on Wheels. Advertisement How often have cyclists wished for a bike basket that could securely hold a bottle of wine and two wineglasses for the duration of their ride? Probably not that often, though with the current proliferation of bike tours taking visitors closer to both nature and alcohol, they may soon be in high demand. It’s with that in mind that Clos du Bois, the winemaker, has partnered with C. Wonder, the bike maker, to create the Clos Cruiser, a basic C. Wonder City Bike model, outfitted with a limited-edition wicker basket with fau -leather loops perfectly sized to steady a bottle of wine and corkscrew, and two fabric pockets made to hold two stemless, shatter-proof, even recyclable Govino wine glasses. To assist the Sonoma County winery with promoting these limited-edition cruisers, the h2hotel, an eco-friendly establishment in nearby Healdsburg, Calif., is offering a special two-night stay package from March 1 through May 31. It includes the use of both the hotel and winery’s Clos Cruisers, a complimentary tasting and picnic at the winery, dinner at the hotel, custom bike maps and a monogrammed wine stopper. (Rates start at $680 for midweek dates, $880 for weekends.) Lucky, perhaps, that the winery is less than five miles from the hotel and the basket holds just one bottle.

By Alan Arbesfeld Mar 2, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — Break out the popcorn and settle into your seats, film buffs, because you’re in for a double feature. Today’s crossword has an Oscar them, just in time for the Academy Awards ceremony. The theme answers concocted by Alan Arbesfeld combine the titles of two films, each of which was nominated for Best Picture in the past. The clues tell you the year in which the films were nominated, but it is up to you to figure out the rest. Take 68 Across as an example: “Part of a line at O’Hare? [2002, 1976]” is a hint for CHICAGO TAXI DRIVER. Get the drift? Even some of the nontheme answers bask in the glow of the silver screen. At 8 Down, PST (for Pacific Standard Time) could have been described in any number of ways, but Alan decided to give it some razzle-dazzle with the clue “the Oscars are awarded on it.” Among the other Hollywood-centric answers we have DISNEY and the director Brian DEPALMA. But film isn’t the only art form covered, as we have a few nods to serious art and literature. For instance, there’s Caravaggio’s “The Sacrifice of ISAAC” and a line from Shakespeare’s Richard III: “A HORSE! My kingdom for a horse!” This was a really fun solve because of its playful theme and its array of really fresh words. To highlight a few, I would mention PINPRICKS, SEAWAYS and MAN ALIVE. I also liked the inclusion of TRADE WAR, though that one took me a while to figure out because I made a mess of the northeast corner. (I had erroneously guessed that “bread holder?” at 40 Across was “basket,” and it fit with all my crossers — at first. WALLET fit the bill much better.) Today’s video clip was inspired by a film that made up one-half of a double-feature theme answer, “Rocky.” What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Foreign   From 1939, Somerset Maugham’s List of Must-Reads. Advertisement Seventy-five years ago, the Paris edition published a list of books recommended by W. Somerset Maugham, the British novelist, to “help you live more fully.” Here is the top 10:  Poetry in three anthologies: ‘‘The Golden Treasury,” “The Oxford Book of English Verse” and Gerald Bullett’s “The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems.” If you don’t like them, Mr. Maugham said, don’t read them. “Every man is his own best critic. Whatever the learned say about a book, however unanimous they are in their praise of it, unless it interests you it is no business of yours,” he wrote. “That is counsel which I wish the high-school teachers of English in the United States would ponder. I doubt if anything is more responsible for the tons of trash read in America than the common school program of forcing good books upon boys and girls when they don’t want it. They acquire a permanent distaste for good literature. “Who is going to acquire the habit of reading for reading’s sake,” Mr. Maugham wrote, “if he is bidden to read books that bore him?” Mr. Maugham’s list is limited to English books. He said that he would not presume to recommend American books to American readers, though he could hardly believe that any American at all inclined to literature could have missed “Huckleberry Finn” or “Moby Dick,” Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” or the stories of Edgar Allan Poe.

Sports   Warriors Soar, Knicks Lag, and Boos Rain Down. Advertisement Advertisement By ZACH SCHONBRUNFEB. 28, 2014 With 8 minutes 26 seconds remaining in the first quarter of Friday’s game against the Golden State Warriors, Knicks Coach Mike Woodson called his first timeout. The Knicks already trailed, 13-6, but it was still early, and there was still a game plan. The tone — for either team — could still be determined. In time, though, the Warriors’ lead swelled to 12 points, then 21, then 27, rising like a departing jet without a moment of turbulence. The Knicks’ body language seemed to worsen with each Golden State 3-pointer (and there were 14 of them). The Knicks snarled when Tyson Chandler was ejected in the fourth quarter. They sulked when time wound down in another runaway defeat. The story of the 126-103 loss was not unlike that of the blowout they suffered a night earlier, against the Miami Heat, except that this was a home game, in front of an increasingly restless and uneasy crowd that showered the Knicks with boos at halftime and after the game. “Fire Woodson” chants circulated. The frustration — from the fans, the players, the coaches, everybody — all but dripped from the bridges traversing the top of the arena. “It’s not a mental thing,” said J. R. Smith, who finished with 17 points. “It’s a heart thing.” Carmelo Anthony, who scored 23 points, had a hard time disagreeing. “When we lose games, it’s embarrassing, like tonight,” Anthony said. “These games are embarrassing. I’m not going against what J. R. said, in terms of the heart, but in my opinion we’re just not very consistent.” Advertisement It did not help matters that the Knicks arrived jet-lagged after the late-night loss in Miami on Thursday to meet the young, fresh-legged Warriors, who are coached by the former Knicks guard Mark Jackson and are one of the N.B.A.’s best offensive teams. The Warriors poured in 38 points in the first quarter, shooting 56 percent, and they were just warming up. Their 126 points were 3 shy of the most the Knicks have allowed all season. The Knicks could have anticipated this, knowing how the Warriors’ All-Star leader, Stephen Curry, revels in performing on the type of stage that a Friday night game at Madison Square Garden offers. In Curry’s last game at the Garden, a year ago, he scored 54 points, with 11 3-pointers, one short of the N.B.A. record. Curry did not light up the Garden as he did that night last February, but he did finish with his fourth career triple-double: 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in 30 minutes. “It’s one of those arenas with history, and you look forward to playing here,” Curry said. “To play well and impact the game the way I wanted to definitely felt great.” The Knicks struggled for continuity on defense, often looking slow, overmatched or confused — or all of the above — while trying to keep up with Golden State’s prolific shooters. The Warriors scored 15 points in transition, and Woodson deemed the Knicks’ defensive effort in that area to be among the worst of the season. “We just didn’t get back and get matched,” Woodson said. When Golden State finished the first half on a 13-4 run, pushing its lead to 73-52, the crowd at the Garden sent the Knicks into the locker room with a shower of boos. The second half was not much better. If there was ever a lull in Golden State’s offensive attack, it was momentary. In the fourth quarter, Tyson Chandler flashed his frustration by shoving Golden State forward Marreese Speights as the two jogged up the court. The two players needed to be separated and were served with matching technical fouls. A few minutes later, Chandler, jawing at Speights again, earned his second technical and an automatic ejection. (He finished with 6 points and 12 rebounds). Advertisement Chandler said his frustration led to the ejection. “I figured we would be a little flat considering the travel schedule,” he said, “but I thought we would be able to do some things to slow them down.” With Chandler gone, Anthony quietly exited, too, calling it a night with four and a half minutes remaining and the Knicks trailing by 19. For a second night in a row, he watched the waning moments of a runaway loss from the bench. With each successive defeat, the Knicks’ chances for a playoff berth sink further, and thoughts inevitably turn to the future — namely what it might have in store for Anthony, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer. The Knicks’ on-court futility, coupled with their continued drama off the court, would seem to make the team less and less desirable to a player of Anthony’s caliber. Anthony, who played 37 minutes Friday, said he might get his right hand examined after receiving several slaps during the course of the game. He shrugged off his apparent fatigue from logging hefty minutes, night after night, as a bright spot for a dimming franchise. But even Anthony might begin to wonder what it is all for. “I keep saying we’ve got to figure it out, figure it out, figure it out,” Anthony said. “It’s time now where we should have it.” REBOUNDS Amar’e Stoudemire was given the night off after playing Thursday night in Miami. Last week, Stoudemire complained of soreness in his left knee, and Mike Woodson held him out of last Wednesday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Business   Echo, Echo. Advertisement By Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake Mar 3, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. MONDAY’S PUZZLE — Happy Monday, everyone. Who’s ready to get this week started? Today’s puzzle, constructed by Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake, features a slew of theme answers in which two similar-sounding words are placed one after the other, creating new phrases with often strange meanings. The words aren’t exact echoes per se, because the second word is one letter shorter than the first. (This means that once you figure out the first half of a theme entry you can confidently fill in the rest of the letters.) I was a big fan of 62 Across, in which the response to “memorize lines for a Shakespearean king?” was LEARN LEAR. Funny enough, I noticed that one of the non-theme answers had a similar thing going on. New Jersey Governor Chris CHRISTIE has repeated syllables in his name, but not quite in the “LEARN LEAR” format. It’s a Monday, so the puzzle is pretty straightforward in terms of solving. Still, a few clues required a few moments to stop and think, like REPO Man, EUGENE and ERSE. My favorite clue had to be “set of keys?” for PIANO, although honorable mention goes to LIRA, the former “capital” of Italy. For today’s video, here’s a clip of “IF WE Never Meet Again” by Elvis.

Foreign   In Our Pages: March 3. Advertisement   ROME — Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope this evening [March 2] on his sixty-third birthday. He took the name Pius XII. His election came at the end of the first day’s balloting, which is almost unprecedented in modern times and indicates that an overwhelming sentiment in his favor must have manifested itself from the opening of the Conclave. The new Pope is the first ever to have visited America. He spent several weeks on vacation in the United States in 1936. His knowledge of and sympathy with America is expected to lead to a strengthening of American representation in the College of Cardinals. In Vatican circles the greatest satisfaction is expressed at the choice and the new Pope is seen as eminently qualified by his experience, wide travel, and diplomatic training, to guide the Church safely through troubled times ahead. News of the election was broadcast throughout the world. The first news, ‘‘Holy Church has a new Pope,’’ flashed over the radio at 5:28 o’clock this afternoon, brought scores of thousands by car and on foot to Saint Peter’s Square to hear the official announcement and receive the new Pope’s blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 1964: New Drive Against Religion Launched by Kremlin MOSCOW — A major new antireligious campaign aimed at everyone from preschool toddlers to pensioners was made public today [March 2] by the Soviet Communist party. In a sweeping decree affecting journalists and other key groups, the party’s Central Committee ordered intensive nationwide efforts to overcome the ‘‘remnants of religion.’’ Published in detail in the Communist party newspaper ‘‘Pravda,’’ the decree called for stepped-up efforts to reach believers in their homes and places of work and to prevent dissemination of religious information among children of preschool age — ‘‘in every settlement and collective.’’ ‘‘Pravda’’ also took to task the party organizations that ‘‘live in peace’’ with party members who observe religious rites. ‘‘Pravda’’ told its readers it was necessary to eliminate ‘‘private-property instincts, nationalistic, religious and other prejudices’’ and it added: ‘‘Any religion or belief in the supernatural, in good and evil, in an almighty creator, is a distorted, antiscientific outlook on nature and science, is a negation of science and a substitution of scientific knowledge by fantastic myths and legends.’’ It said: “Any religion turns a man into a slave of the gods he invented.’’  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Sports   Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise. Advertisement Advertisement By ROB REISCHELMARCH 2, 2014 MILWAUKEE — Jason Collins is finally heading to his new home. He will be bringing along an ascending team that continues to play rock-solid basketball. Collins and the Nets downed the host Milwaukee Bucks, 107-98, on Saturday night to cap a 6-game, 11-day trip. The Nets displayed depth, getting 54 points from their reserves — more than half their total. “I can’t wait to go home,” said forward Andray Blatche, who had a huge night off the bench with 19 points and 13 rebounds. “It’s been a long trip.” It was also a successful one for the Nets (28-29), who went 4-2 on their trip and pulled within three and a half games of Toronto, which leads the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The Nets also improved to 18-8 since Jan. 1, their best record to start a calendar year since 2002, when their current head coach, Jason Kidd, led the team to the N.B.A. finals. Marcus Thornton, acquired from Sacramento in a trade on Feb. 20, led the way with 25 points, going 4 of 7 from 3-point range. He was one of five players with more than 10 points for the Nets, who held off a gutsy effort from a Milwaukee team that has the N.B.A.’s worst record (11-47). Advertisement “I think this is a very positive road trip,” Kidd said, “starting in Utah, but understanding that the last game is always the hardest because you’re thinking about getting home. And I thought the guys came out from the start and put ourselves in position to win the game.” Collins, the N.B.A.’s first openly gay active player, had a productive eight-minute stint in which he did the little things that have made him a favorite of Kidd’s, setting solid screens and playing strong defense while adding a veteran presence. On Monday, the Nets will host Chicago, giving Collins a chance to make his first appearance at Barclays Center since he signed a 10-day contract Feb. 23. “Yeah, looking forward to it,” Collins said. “I’ve obviously played in the arena before. It would be nice obviously to play in front of the home crowd.” Just 48 hours before the Nets’ latest win, Collins presented an autographed No. 98 jersey to the family of Matthew Shepard in Denver. Collins wears the number in honor of Shepard, a gay college student who was murdered in Wyoming in 1998. “It was special,” Collins said of his meeting with Shepard’s family. “It was a great meeting, and they’re a wonderful family, and I’m very fortunate to have that with them. I’ll say it was a great experience — again, very fortunate, very glad that they drove down from Wyoming and glad to have met with them.” The Nets, who were once 3-9 and later 5-13, are now making a push to host a first-round playoff series. They played without Kevin Garnett, who sat out with back spasms. “I don’t think it’s long term,” Kidd said. “This is his rest day, so we’ll get him some proper rest and see how he feels tomorrow.” Advertisement Without Garnett, the Nets’ bench stepped up in a big way. “That’s what we do,” Blatche said. “We just came out and did what we do.” Neither side played much defense in the first half, and the Nets carried a 55-53 lead into halftime. They shot 48.8 percent from the floor, and Milwaukee connected on 46.3 percent of its attempts. Nets guard Deron Williams went 3 for 5 from 3-point range and scored 13 of his 15 points in the first half. Thornton made all four of his field-goal attempts and had 13 points in nine minutes. The Nets stretched their lead to 77-72 through three quarters, with Shaun Livingston and Paul Pierce each scoring 6 points in the third. The Nets opened the fourth quarter on an 8-2 blitz to grab an 85-74 lead. Thornton and Blatche began the burst with baskets, and Mirza Teletovic drained a 3-pointer to force a Milwaukee timeout. The Bucks closed the gap to 4 points with five minutes remaining. But Thornton drained a pair of 3-pointers to stymie any hopes of a Bucks comeback. “We’re bringing the pieces together right now and trying to form some continuity going into the stretch run,” said Livingston, who had 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting. “For us to be as good as we want to be, we need to have all five guys playing as a unit,” he added. Now, after nearly two weeks on the road, the Nets are going home. And after sitting out most of the season and hoping for a chance to extend his career, Collins cannot wait. “To put into words right now, nah,” Collins said when asked what the last week had meant to him. “You know, obviously, things happen very quickly. The events over the past week have been very special.” A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise.

Business   Spirit of Experiment. Advertisement By Bruce Haight and Peter A. Collins Mar 4, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — Bifocals, the lightning rod and the odometer. These are just a few of the everyday objects that BENJAMIN FRANKLIN invented when he wasn’t busy with his other hobbies. Like publishing Poor Richard’s Almanac. Or developing the postal service. Or, oh yeah, fostering American independence. Reading his full roster of accomplishments will make you feel like a dolt. Then again, you may come away inspired by that spirit of innovation, as today’s constructors evidently were. Indeed, Bruce Haight and Peter A. Collins have come up with a highly original form of presentation for today’s puzzle. At first glance you’ll notice that it’s an asymmetrical grid, which is uncommon enough, but look a little bit closer and you’ll see that the black squares are arranged to depict an image that relates to today’s theme. That image is of A KITE, related to that BRAINY fellow’s famous ELECTRICITY experiment during a lightning storm in 1752. I’ll pass it over to Bruce and Pete to tell you how this idea came about. Bruce writes: “Pete Collins and I have been friends since childhood, when our families used to vacation together on a small lake in Wisconsin. He agreed to mentor me in 2012 when I got interested in constructing crosswords. I got this electricity puzzle idea when I was “block-doodling” one day on the computer and noticed I could make a pretty realistic looking kite. My wife Liz suggested I tie in Ben Franklin so I worked some lightning bolts into the grid. The first version had BEN and KEY attached to the bottom of the kite string, but that did not fly. I loved the grid art though, so I shipped the puzzle to Pete to see if he could get this project off the ground — I’ll let him finish the story. Thanks for everything, Pete!” Pete adds: “Bruce and I share an interest in ‘grid art.’ I think this grid is particularly nice, with the kite and lightning bolts. But make no mistake — this one is Bruce’s baby (I’m just the godfather). We went back and forth several times, with the kite being oriented various ways, before we settled on this arrangement. In addition to the grid art, I really like the highly unusual diagonal symmetry — and the three pairs of themed answers. And our reward for getting this puzzle published? We get three Benjamins!” Putting aside the theme for a moment, this puzzle also boats a high number of fresh answers, among them DR DOOM, FUR COAT, PHENOMS and OLD TIMER, which made for a fun solve. For today’s clip, here’s a video of the armonica, the musical instrument invented by Franklin.  What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Business   Bond Market in China May See First Local Default. Advertisement Updated, 8:18 p.m. | HONG KONG — Chinese companies have been selling record amounts of bonds on the domestic market in recent years. But in a sign that market forces have not been at work, analysts have been quick to point out, none of them have ever had a default. That may be about to change. A small company in Shanghai has said it is unlikely to meet a Friday deadline for an annual interest payment, putting it at risk of becoming the first company to default in China’s domestic bond market, which could have broader ramifications. The Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company, which makes solar cells and panels, issued a stock exchange announcement on Tuesday saying that “due to various uncontrollable factors” the company was unlikely to be able to meet the payment of 89.8 million renminbi, or $14.6 million, on a bond of one billion renminbi that it sold to domestic investors in 2012. Chaori said it had come up with only about 4 million renminbi, meaning that unless it receives a bailout or generates fresh cash, it will default. As of Wednesday, the company did not appear any closer to resolving its debt problem. “Since the official announcement yesterday as regards our debt repayment situation, there has been no additional development thus far,” said Liu Tielong, a spokesman for Chaori. Until now, investors’ concerns about potential problems with debt accumulation in China have tended to focus on ever-expanding local government borrowing or the rapid, often unwieldy, growth of the shadow banking sector. But the prospect of a default in the domestic corporate bond market introduces an additional dimension to assessing the overall picture of China’s indebtedness. “In China’s case, the focus is on the knock-on effects of one default and whether those would prove to be detrimental to the overall bond market,” said Ted Osborn, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong who specializes in debt restructuring. “If one of the domestic bond issuers were to default, would that cause the market to teeter or to crash?” Corporate bonds fell on Wednesday in China. The ChinaBond New Composite Total Return Index, a broad indicator of the market, was down 0.16 percent. Over the last decade, China’s corporate bond market has grown from almost nothing to become the third largest in the world, trailing only those of the United States and Japan, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements. Total corporate bonds outstanding have risen to 8.5 trillion renminbi at the end of last year, or about $1.4 trillion, from about 500 billion renminbi at the end of 2005, according to official figures were compiled by the Asian Development Bank. Despite its tremendous size, China’s domestic bond market remains underdeveloped. It is still largely closed to foreign investors, and critics say it does a poor job of pricing in risk. The lack of defaults in China’s domestic debt markets has been unusual, even by the country’s own standards. Chinese companies that have sold bonds denominated in dollars to international investors in offshore debt markets have defaulted in the past. A default last year by Suntech Power was a notable example in the solar industry. In this regard, analysts see a potential onshore bond default as having positive implications, a sign that the market is maturing. “We think it’s a good thing, as a normal economy needs defaults to better price bonds and other debt products,” Ting Lu, a China economist, and other analysts at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit wrote on Wednesday in a research note. “Defaults of some debt products are not on a similar scale to a collapse of a major financial institution.” Still, officials have been wary of corporate defaults, not least because they can lead to layoffs and social instability as businesses are shut or otherwise restructured. This is especially true when state-owned companies are involved. Chaori, which is not run by the government, encountered problems making an interest payment on its bonds in early 2013. But at the time, local officials in Shanghai and the company’s state-backed bond underwriter made a deal to cover principal payments so Chaori could meet its interest payments, according to local news media and analyst reports. Given the Friday deadline, a bailout is not out of the question for Chaori. But several analysts on Wednesday interpreted the default as a fait accompli. Letting Chaori default “will help go some way to correct the moral hazard problem in China’s financial sector, and that is positive for the long-term development of the onshore bond market,” Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura, wrote on Wednesday in a research note. Because the company has been struggling financially for a while, “the immediate repercussions in the bond market may not be systemic,” he added. “Nonetheless, we continue to expect more credit defaults in the corporate, local government financing vehicle and shadow banking sectors this year.” Hilda Wang contributed reporting.

Foreign   Bangalore Welcomes a Later Last Call. Advertisement BANGALORE — As India’s hub of globalization, Bangalore has long had one major obstacle in its quest to be a truly cosmopolitan city: a lack of nightlife, thanks to a stringent city ordinance mandating an 11:30 p.m. closing time for its many bars and restaurants. On weekends, a familiar scene would play out, starting with the bartenders and waiting staff issuing the last call for orders even before 11 p.m. After a little while, the music would stop and the bouncers would start closing in on those trying to linger. Tales of ambition and youth from India’s outsourcing hub. Even as the staff tried to hurry the guests out, the police would arrive. The customers would start arguing with the staff and the police, but in the end, they would lose. Finally, long before the Cinderella hour, the party would be over. This past weekend, K.J. George, the home minister of the state of Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital, said he would allow the city’s bars and restaurants a three-month trial run to extend operations until 1 a.m., as residents were clamoring for the change. The new closing time is likely to go into effect within the next two weeks. Not even the recent announcements of free public Wi-Fi and electric buses on the roads has generated as much excitement in what is known as India’s pub capital, home to a huge population of young professionals. The residents of Bangalore will now be able to enjoy a nightlife like their friends do in Mumbai and Delhi. “Bangalore has finally grown up and got a life,” said Ashwin Nair, 28, a marketing executive at a multinational engineering company who finishes work at 8:30 p.m. and has to scramble to catch a drink with friends. “There will be time to drink a couple of beers and have a decent conversation without worrying about being hustled out,” he said. In the 1980s and 1990s, coinciding with a boom in outsourcing and call centers in Bangalore, pubs, discos and bars proliferated in the city.  They stayed open until late to accommodate young employees working around the clock.  The bars were relaxed spaces where women could drink in public – unheard of even in bigger cities like Delhi at the time – and where bouncers and condom vending machines came into vogue. The proliferation of pubs and bars triggered resentment among older and middle-class residents who believed that the drinking and dancing would destroy Indian culture and ruin their children. In the last decade, however, the city’s understaffed police force has brought in a series of restrictions on such businesses, citing an archaic 1960s law.  So besides forcing pubs and restaurants to shut down at 11:30 p.m., the police have severely curtailed the playing of loud music, dancing and bartending by female employees. “Imagine, the government was constantly telling full-grown, tax-paying adults how to behave,” said Siddharth Poojari, owner of a restaurant chain and a high-profile bar in the upmarket UB City Mall. Mindful that the government will be watching them closely during this trial period, bar owners and restaurateurs said they would take steps to make Bangalore safe even with the extended hours. A few bar owners are talking of introducing in-house breathalyzer tests so that customers can check their blood alcohol levels before taking off.  Others are discussing partnerships with cab companies to ferry customers home. “It is all for the collective good,” Mr. Poojari said.  “We are on a three-month probation; we have to prove that we can behave responsibly.” Young people like Sanjana Nanjappa, 24, a behavior therapist who lives with her parents, will have to figure out how to calm parental fears about staying out later, and that’s where the city authorities can help. Ms. Nanjappa said her parents would feel more reassured if other services like transport, including public transit and taxis, and the police adjusted to the late hours as well. Bangalore’s police force has received $830,000 and approval to hire an additional 2,500 officers from the city government. “We are working out a plan, and we are confident we will handle it well,” said Raghavendra H. Auradkar, the Bangalore police commissioner. Saritha Rai sometimes feels she is the only person living in Bangalore who was actually raised here.

Science   Is Breast-Feeding Really Better? Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Many women who are unable to breast-feed feel guilty about it and worry they may be depriving their children of a range of benefits. Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend six months of exclusive breast-feeding for all infants, citing studies that show breast milk is easily digestible and has nutrients that are superior to or absent from infant formulas, including immunological substances that reduce rates of infection and fatty acids important in brain development. But now a new study suggests that many of the long-term benefits attributed to breast-feeding may be an effect not of breast-feeding or breast milk itself but of the general good health and prosperity of women who choose to breast-feed. Researchers at Ohio State University compared 1,773 sibling pairs, one of whom had been breast-fed and one bottle-fed, on 11 measures of health and intellectual competency. The children ranged in age from 4 to 14 years. The researchers recorded various health and behavioral outcomes in the sibling pairs, including body mass index, obesity, asthma, hyperactivity, reading comprehension, math ability and memory-based intelligence. The study, published online in Social Science & Medicine, found no statistically significant differences between the breast-fed and bottle-fed siblings on any of these measures. By studying “discordant” siblings — one of whom had been breast-fed and the other not — the authors sought to minimize the possibility that racial, socioeconomic, educational or other differences between families could affect the results. Many earlier studies on breast-feeding failed to control for such factors, they say. Campaigns to increase the rate of breast-feeding have been highly successful in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about three-quarters of American mothers now breast-feed, compared with less than two-thirds in 2000, and about 49 percent are still breast-feeding at six months, compared with 34 percent in 2000. Yet despite this increase, researchers have consistently found large socioeconomic and racial disparities in breast-feeding rates. A C.D.C. survey in 2008 found that 75 percent of white infants and 59 percent of black infants were ever breast-fed, and in 2013, the agency reported that 47 percent of white babies but only 30 percent of black babies were still being breast-fed at 6 months. Compared with bottle-fed infants, breast-fed babies are more likely to be born into families with higher incomes, have parents with higher educational attainments, and live in safer neighborhoods with easier access to health care services. Still, sibling studies such as this latest one do not solve all the problems of bias. “We were not able to control for everything that could affect what would make a mom breast-feed one child and not the other,” said the lead author, Cynthia G. Colen, an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio State. “But we did control for premature birth, birth order, the age of the mother, and whether she was working when she had one infant and not when she had the other.” Geoff Der, a statistician at the University of Glasgow who has worked with the same data in previous studies, said that the findings in the present study were robust and the authors’ method for eliminating selection bias was powerful. He had reassuring words for women who do not or cannot breast-feed. “In a society with a clean water supply and modern formulas,” he said, “a woman who isn’t able to breast-feed shouldn’t be feeling guilty, and the likelihood that there’s any harm to the baby is pretty slim.” Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Travel   In Newark Airport Lounge, Israeli Art. Advertisement A new lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport is providing an artistic – -and kosher — respite for travelers to Israel who might be looking for more than just free Wi-Fi and contemporary furniture while they wait. “Art & Lounge,” in Newark’s Terminal B, serves as place to relax but also a gallery for a rotation of Israeli artists, featuring installations curated by Lital Dotan and Eyal Perry, two artists from Tel Aviv who have made a life’s practice of turning their homes into live exhibition spaces, and exhibition spaces into their home. (They now operate the Glasshouse Project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which they describe as an “art-life-lab.”) The couple’s first show at the Newark lounge, called “Window Seat,” replaces the typical nonstop news broadcast on lounge televisions with a metaphorical airplane window, a video presentation of several landscapes created by four artists: Miriam Cabessa, Oded Hirsch, Shay Kun and Tom Pnini, who each contributed other works as well. “In the frame of a house,” the curators explained in a statement about the exhibition, “a window seat has romantic associations, as they are often identified with luxury of spare time.” In airplanes, they added, the window seat serves as a dimension of psychological space and in an airport terminal it is “a space of transition and restlessness, and manifests a state of in-between, which is why ‘Window Seat’ offers an invitation to stay, pause, reflect, before moving on to the next destination.” An assortment of healthy and kosher foods, picked by Shmulik Markus, a chef and the chief executive of Restotel, an Israeli hospitality and restaurant company, are also available to visitors, along with a selection of wine and beer. El Al Airlines has been the first to make use of the lounge since it opened in November, offering free access to its premier passengers. But Luxury Lounges Ltd., the design firm that created the space, hopes to open it up to more travelers for a fee — around $35 — in the near future.

Business   Scrub Up. Advertisement By Daniel Raymon Mar 6, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — Erno RUBIK, the Hungarian architect who is best known for inventing the Rubik’s Cube, once said that “the problems of puzzles are very near the problems of life.” So if your life doesn’t have enough problems already, take a crack at Daniel Raymon’s rebus, which will help you meet your quota. I will resist the urge to say too much about the rebus, but I’ll just say that the easiest point of entry is at 19 Across if you remember that “Cajun French” is a DIALECT. The puzzle holds up in the non-theme answer department, too. There are several entries that include the letters J and K, which can be tough to place in a crossword. Just to pick a few as examples, there’s JAMBS and JINX, and KABOB and KARAT. Daniel’s notes are below. But beware, as there are spoilers. This is my first Thursday puzzle so I’m very excited for everyone to see it. It’s especially exciting to have my very own creation join the group of NYT rebus puzzles. On that note, there have been other rebus puzzles using “box” phrases as revealers, just like this one. One thing that makes mine a little different, I think, is that each rebus box is a different word. I also like how I was able to split up both ZEST and TONE in two different ways; not so for LAVA and DIAL, but at least there’s some symmetry there — two split up differently, two not. I also like the long answers for the most part, though PASADENA, BRUSSELS and BRATIS[LAVA] might be a bit too much geography for one puzzle. Also RA[DIAL] TIRE and PIS[TON E]NGINE are a bit bland, especially for theme answers. Oh well. Overall I’m very happy with the puzzle, and I hope you enjoy it too!

Business   Shell Game. Advertisement By Ruth B. Margolin Feb 26, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — Today marks the debut of crossword constructor Ruth B. Margolin, whose first-ever New York Times puzzle has been rated a Wednesday difficulty. Not bad for a newcomer. Appropriately enough for a debut, the puzzle’s language exudes the idea of achievement and of reaching new heights. There’s a nod to the first flight of the Wright brothers with the clue for AVIATE and to another entry about upward-climbing mountaineers with ASCENTS. Those who enjoy a good echo will be treated to a fine example today with the repeat use of the word “shell.” The clues in question are “Shell carries it” and “It carries a shell,” referring, respectively to GAS and a SNAIL. Context is key, folks — it could mean the difference between an oil company and a mollusk. Some other noteworthy entries include “1984 superstate” for EURASIA, and “winter topper” for SKI CAP. I had no idea about the answer for “sheer curtain fabric” at 38 Across, but I was bailed out by a couple familiar crossers — among them, Che GUEVARA, the trusty SPORK, and an airtight ALIBI. That gave me more than enough letters to hazard a guess about the fabric, and voilà! It’s VOILE! Now I’ll turn the mike over to Ruth: I am quite excited to have my first puzzle published, and what began as a lark has become an engaging hobby. I solve the puzzle daily, and occasionally a puzzle takes a particular approach to playing with language that gives me an “I can do that!” feeling and sends me off in search of words and puns that fit my concept. I no longer remember any particular puzzle that sparked the wordplay part of my brain and led me to create this one, adding IST to familiar words. The challenge of course, was that the addition of IST had to change the meaning of the word entirely. There’s no humor in changing “violin” to “violinist.” So to the word lists. I pored through lists of words containing IST, mentally subtracting the IST to find those words that could then be built into phrases that had the potential to win a chuckle once the IST was put back in. So from “cubist” to “cub” to “cub reporter” to CUBISTREPORTER. I think my favorite answer has to be SLEEPERCELLISTS (though my proposed clue was “Musicians who tend to be flat?”). Having played in the wind section of orchestras throughout my youth, I know what it is to count many dozens of measures of rests before an entrance, trying to maintain concentration, while the string players played without pause. It always seemed possible that someone might one day fall asleep, but I never thought it would be the cellists! I was pleased with the phrases I was able to create, and even more pleased that Will (finally!) liked them, too. (I don’t think I have to confess here just how many of my submissions have not made the grade….) So now that I’ve met Will’s standards and made my debut, am I a strict constructionIST? In honor of 41 down, here’s a sample of the CALYPSO music of Harry Belafonte. What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Foreign   New Coalition Takes On India’s Two Biggest Parties. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — Eleven political parties, including seven regional parties, formed a coalition on Tuesday in hopes of drawing voters away from India’s two main national parties in the general elections in May. “We have resolved to come together to present an alternative before the country,” said Prakash Karat, general secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist), one of the members of the coalition, which is made up of the biggest regional parties in India, like the Samajwadi Party and Janata Dal (United). Mr. Karat condemned the Indian National Congress, which leads the governing coalition in New Delhi, for its corruption scandals and policies, which he called flawed, and accused the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., of trying to divide the country with its Hindu nationalist politics. He said nine parties met in the capital on Tuesday to form the alliance, with the leaders of the two other parties, Biju Janata Dal and Asom Gana Parishad, unable to attend but giving their assent. Sanjay Kaul, the B.J.P. spokesman for the party’s New Delhi chapter, dismissed the new coalition as a nonfactor in the elections. “No front can survive unless it has a magnetic core or a gravitational pull,” he said. “They may coalesce because of situational advantages, but when it comes to a push and a shove, they would surely break down.” The coalition comes at a time when opinion polls conducted by media organizations have suggested that regional political parties could play a major role in forming the next government in case either of the two national parties fall short of an absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament. Currently, the coalition has 92 seats in the lower house. That compares with 201 seats for the Congress party and 112 for the Bharatiya Janata Party. A party or alliance needs to have at least 272 members in the Lok Sabha, which has 543 members, to have any realistic chance of forming the next government. But even if the new coalition, which does not yet have a name, manages to take power, a look at the history of Indian politics shows that such so-called third-front governments – that is, those that are not led by Congress or the B.J.P. — have largely been unstable and unable to complete the full five-year term. One of the early experiments in third-front politics occurred in 1989, when a broad coalition of parties under Janata Dal formed a government under Prime Minister V.P. Singh. But disagreements among allies and the creation of factions led the government to fold in less than a year. Another coalition government was formed, this time under Chandra Shekhar, but this too splintered within a year. In 1996, the same scenes played out when the general elections ended in a fractured mandate. After B.J.P., which emerged as the single largest party with 161 seats, was unable to cobble together a majority in the Lok Sabha, a similar third-front government under Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda of Janata Dal came to power with the support of the Congress party. However, coalition strains again led the government to fall within a year. I.K. Gujral, another Janata Dal leader, was nominated to the prime minister’s post the same year, but he too could not stay in power for long. The government fell the next year and fresh elections were called. Since 1998, leaders of regional parties with prime ministerial ambitions have largely been forced to stand aside, as all central governments have been led by either the Congress party or the B.J.P. “It is my personal opinion that the third front is not at all plausible,” said Subhash Kashyap, an honorary professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. “It will not have a sizable win in the elections.” He said if the new coalition came to power, it would probably discourage economic development in India because of the inherent instability of such an alliance and the ideologies of the members. “If there is no political stability, there can be no economic reforms,” he said. “If you see the constituents of the third front, some of them are very much against economic reforms.” Rohit Ghosh, vice president and a senior research analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, said in a statement this month that the rise of regional parties would continue to “hamper the efficacy of nationwide policy making, regardless of the political complexion of the eventual central government.” However, he said, a phenomenal showing by any of the country’s major parties would not guarantee economic growth either. How do you think the new coalition will do in the national elections? Please leave your comments below. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16.

Science   The Brain’s Inner Language. Advertisement Advertisement The Map Makers By JAMES GORMAN FEB. 24, 2014 Clay Reid and colleagues are going deep into the mouse brain to decipher the conversations and decisions of neurons. SEATTLE — When Clay Reid decided to leave his job as a professor at Harvard Medical School to become a senior investigator at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle in 2012, some of his colleagues congratulated him warmly and understood right away why he was making the move. Others shook their heads. He was, after all, leaving one of the world’s great universities to go to the academic equivalent of an Internet start-up, albeit an extremely well- financed, very ambitious one, created in 2003 by Paul Allen, a founder of Microsoft. Still, “it wasn’t a remotely hard decision,” Dr. Reid said. He wanted to mount an all-out investigation of a part of the mouse brain. And although he was happy at Harvard, the Allen Institute offered not only great colleagues and deep pockets, but also an approach to science different from the classic university environment. The institute was already mapping the mouse brain in fantastic detail, and specialized in the large-scale accumulation of information in atlases and databases available to all of science. Now, it was expanding, and trying to merge its semi-industrial approach to data gathering with more traditional science driven by individual investigators, by hiring scientists like Christof Koch from the California Institute of Technology as chief scientific officer in 2011 and Dr. Reid. As a senior investigator, he would lead a group of about 100, and work with scientists, engineers and technicians in other groups. Without the need to apply regularly for federal grants, Dr. Reid could concentrate on one piece of the puzzle of how the brain works. He would try to decode the workings of one part of the mouse brain, the million neurons in the visual cortex, from, as he puts it, “molecules to behavior.” Advertisement There are many ways to map the brain and many kinds of brains to map. Although the ultimate goal of most neuroscience is understanding how human brains work, many kinds of research can’t be done on human beings, and the brains of mice and even flies share common processes with human brains. The work of Dr. Reid, and scientists at Allen and elsewhere who share his approach, is part of a surge of activity in brain research as scientists try to build the tools and knowledge to explain — as well as can ever be explained — how brains and minds work. Besides the Obama administration’s $100 million Brain Initiative and the European Union’s $1 billion, decade-long Human Brain Project, there are numerous private and public research efforts in the United States and abroad, some focusing on the human brain, others like Dr. Reid’s focusing on nonhumans. While the Human Connectome Project, which is spread among several institutions, aims for an overall picture of the associations among parts of the human brain, other scientific teams have set their sights on drilling to deeper levels. For instance, the Connectome Project at Harvard is pursuing a structural map of the mouse brain at a level of magnification that shows packets of neurochemicals at the tips of brain cells. At Janelia Farm, the Virginia research campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, researchers are aiming for an understanding of the complete fly brain — a map of sorts, if a map can be taken to its imaginable limits, including structure, chemistry, genetics and activity. “I personally am inspired by what they’re doing at Janelia,” Dr. Reid said. All these efforts start with maps and enrich them. If Dr. Reid is successful, he and his colleagues will add what you might call the code of a brain process, the language the neurons use to store, transmit and process information for this function. Not that this would be any kind of final answer. In neuroscience, perhaps more than in most other disciplines, every discovery leads to new questions. “With the brain,” Dr. Reid said, “you can always go deeper.” ‘Psychoanalyst’s Kid Probes Brain!’ Dr. Reid, 53, grew up in Boston, in a family with deep roots in medicine. His grandfather taught physiology at Harvard Medical School. “My parents were both psychoanalysts,” he said during an interview last fall, smiling as he imagined a headline for this article, “Psychoanalyst’s Kid Probes Brain!” Advertisement “I pretty much always knew that I wanted to be a scientist,” he said. As an undergraduate at Yale, he majored in physics and philosophy and in mathematics, but in the end decided he didn’t want to be a physicist. Biology was attractive, but he was worried enough about his mathematical bent to talk to one of his philosophy professors about concerns that biology would too fuzzy for him. The professor had some advice. “You really should read Hubel and Wiesel,” he said, referring to David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, who had just won the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their work showing how binocular vision develops in the brain. He read their work, and when he graduated in 1982, he was convinced that the study of the brain was both hard science and a wide-open field. He went on to an M.D.-Ph.D. program at Cornell Medical College and Rockefeller University, where Dr. Wiesel had his lab (he would go on to be president of Rockefeller). As his studies progressed, Dr. Reid began to have second thoughts about pursuing medicine rather than research. Just a week before he was to commit to a neurology residency, he said, “I ran into a friend from the Wiesel lab and said, ‘Save me.’ ” That plea led to postdoctoral research in the Rockefeller lab. He stayed as a faculty member until moving to Harvard in 1996. Advertisement Mathematics and physics were becoming increasingly important in neurobiology, a trend that has continued, but there was still a certain tension between different mind-sets, he recalled. He found that there were intangible skills involved in biological research. “Good biological intuition was equally important to chops in math and physics,” he said. “Torsten once said to me, ‘You know, Clay, science is not an intelligence test.’ ” Though he didn’t recall that specific comment, Dr. Wiesel said recently that it sounded like something he would have said. “I think there are a lot of smart people who never make it in science. Why is it? What is it that is required in addition?” Intuition is important, he said, “knowing what kind of questions to ask.” And, he said, “the other thing is a passion for getting to the core of the problem.” Advertisement Dr. Reid, he said, was not only smart and full of energy, but also “interested in asking questions that I think can get to the core of a problem.” At Harvard, Dr. Reid worked on the Connectome Project to map the connections between neurons in the mouse brain. The Connectome Project aims at a detailed map, a wiring diagram at a level fantastically more detailed than the work being done to map the human brain with M.R.I. machines. But electron microscopes produce a static picture from tiny slices of preserved brain. Dr. Reid began working on tying function to mapping. He and one of his graduate students, Davi Bock, now at Janelia Farm, linked studies of active mouse brains to the detailed structural images produced by electron microscopes. Dr. Bock said he recalled Dr. Reid as having developed exactly the kind of intuition and “good lab hands” that Dr. Wiesel seemed to be encouraging. He and another graduate student were stumped by a technical problem involving a new technique for studying living brains, and Dr. Reid came by. “Clay got on this bench piled up with components,” Dr. Bock said. “He started plugging and unplugging different power cables. We just stood there watching him, and I was sure he was going to scramble everything.” But he didn’t. Whatever he did worked. FEB. 24, 2014 That was part of the fun of working in the lab, Dr. Bock said, “not that he got it right every time.” But his appreciation for Dr. Reid as a leader and mentor went beyond admiration for his “mad scientist lab hands.” “He has a deep gut level enthusiasm for what’s beautiful and what’s profound in neuroscience, and he’s kind of relentless,” Dr. Bock said. Showing a Mouse a Picture That instinct, enthusiasm and relentlessness will be necessary for his current pursuit. To crack the code of the brain, Dr. Reid said, two fundamental problems must be solved. Advertisement The first is: “How does the machine work, starting with its building blocks, cell types, going through their physiology and anatomy,” he said. That means knowing all the different types of neurons in the mouse visual cortex and their function — information that science doesn’t have yet. It also means knowing what code is used to pass on information. When a mouse sees a picture, how is that picture encoded and passed from neuron to neuron? That is called neural computation. “The other highly related problem is: How does that neural computation create behavior?” he said. How does the mouse brain decide on action based on that input? He imagined the kind of experiment that would get at these deep questions. A mouse might be trained to participate in an experiment now done with primates in which an animal looks at an image. Later, seeing several different images in sequence, the animal presses a lever when the original one appears. Seeing the image, remembering it, recognizing it and pressing the lever might take as long as two seconds and involve activity in several parts of the brain. Understanding those two seconds, Dr. Reid said, would mean knowing “literally what photons hit the retina, what information does the retina send to the thalamus and the cortex, what computations do the neurons in the cortex do and how do they do it, how does that level of processing get sent up to a memory center and hold the trace of that picture over one or two seconds.” Then, when the same picture is seen a second time, “the hard part happens,” he said. “How does the decision get made to say, ‘That’s the one’?” In pursuit of this level of understanding, Dr. Reid and others are gathering chemical, electrical, genetic and other information about what the structure of that part of the mouse brain is and what activity is going on. They will develop electron micrographs that show every neuron and every connection in that part of a mouse brain. That is done on dead tissue. Then they will use several techniques to see what goes on in that part of the brain when a living animal reacts to different situations. “We can record the activity of every single cell in a volume of cortex, and capture the connections,” he said. Advertisement With chemicals added to the brain, the most advanced light microscopes can capture movies of neurons firing. Electrodes can record the electrical impulses. And mathematical analysis of all that may decipher the code in which information is moved around that part of the brain. Dr. Reid says solving the first part of the problem — receiving and analyzing sensory information — might be done in 10 years. An engineer’s precise understanding of everything from photons to action could be more on the order of 20 to 30 years away, and not reachable through the work of the Allen Institute alone. But, he wrote in an email, “the large-scale, coordinated efforts at the institute will get us there faster.” He is studying only one part of one animal’s brain, but, he said, the cortex — the part of the mammalian brain where all this calculation goes on — is something of a general purpose computer. So the rules for one process could explain other processes, like hearing. And the rules for decision-making could apply to many more complicated situations in more complicated brains. Perhaps the mouse visual cortex can be a kind of Rosetta stone for the brain’s code. All research is a gamble, of course, and the Allen Institute’s collaborative approach, while gaining popularity in neuroscience, is not universally popular. Dr. Wiesel said it was “an important approach” that would “provide a lot of useful information.” But, he added, “it won’t necessarily create breakthroughs in our understanding of how the brain works.” “I think the main advances are going to be made by individual scientists working in small groups,” he said. Of course, in courting and absorbing researchers like Dr. Reid, the Allen Institute has been moving away from its broad data-gathering approach toward more focused work by individual investigators. Dr. Bock, his former student, said his experience suggested that Dr. Reid had not only a passion and intensity for research, but a good eye for where science is headed as well. “That’s what Clay does,” he said. “He is really good in that Wayne Gretzky way of skating to where the puck will be.” The Map Makers: Second in a series of articles about scientists behind the new efforts to explore the brain.

Travel   An Inside Look at Cooking and Dining in Tel Aviv. Advertisement Six years ago, Tel Aviv tapped into its inner voyeur when it joined the international movement “Houses from Within,” a festival in which residents of some of the city’s most interesting (and opulent) homes fling open their doors and allow the public to visit. Now the city has created its own spin-off event, with some of Tel Aviv’s most prestigious chefs opening their kitchen doors and allowing snoops and snackers alike a chance to see the workings of a restaurant from the inside. Open Restaurants, which had a test run last July and will offer its first full-fledged event beginning Wednesday, includes kitchen sneak-peeks, culinary workshops and chef-guided tours of Tel Aviv’s open-air market. “We’re going to try to show you the restaurant from the inside, how we get our supplies here, how we cook it, and later of course, how we eat it,” said Orel Kimchi, chef and owner at Popina, one of the 70 restaurants hosting events over the four-day festival. On Mr. Kimchi’s docket for the event is a trip to the local fishmonger, spectators in tow, where he will purchase a fresh drum fish and then offer a master class on scaling it, filleting it and preparing it five ways. Other workshops include ice cream making, learning the science of pizza dough and a chance to peer into the kitchen during a frenzied service at theTel Aviv hot spot Brasserie. Workshops range from  50 shekels (about $15) to  300  shekels ($88), most in Hebrew with a select few offered in English. Reservations and more information are at open-restaurants.co.il.

Business   Anything Goes. Advertisement By Stanley Newman Feb 27, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE —#8212; Stanley Newman, the man behind today’s AMAZIN’ crossword, has created a theme set “in a neighborhood bar,” in which four answers together form a sentence you might hear at a local tavern. The sort of place where everybody knows your name — and everyone’s a gossip. Solve the puzzle and you’ll see what I mean. Some answers came as easy as LAY UPS while others took PLENTY of time. The bartender MOE was a gimme (at least for us Simpsons fanatics) and a welcome way to make inroads into the northern half of the puzzle — leading to entries like ENAMEL and FAKE. But the more esoteric clues took quite a while. The enigmatic 2 Down (“formed, as schoolyard teams, say”) was one of the first clues that I read but it was the last that I solved. Did it take anybody else a long time to figure out CHOSE UP? This puzzle also asks a question about the Summer Games, keeping the Olympic spirit going just days after the conclusion of the Sochi festivities. The clue at 37 Down asks for the “locale of three Summer Olympics,” and the answer Stanley is looking for is broader than just a city — it is the whole continent of ASIA, home to the host cities of Tokyo (1964), Seoul (1988) and Beijing (2008). Stanley has a lot to say about his construction, so I’ll let him have a word. Inspiration for this puzzle came from my 30-year-old son Marc (whom Will bounced on his knee at my home about 27 years ago), who sells items on eBay for his London office-salvage business. One of his recent items was a plaque with the theme message, for which only the original WE’LL needed to be changed to WE WILL to break perfectly. By dumb luck, Will was short of non-rebus Thursdays, so it appears today only 19 days after he OK’d it. I clue puzzles hard by having as many “new” clues as possible, requiring some thought and reasoning to solve, rather than ones that can be solved at sight by solvers with good memories. Most of the new factual clues here come from Internet research, such as 52A, 63A, 8D and 34D. An added requirement to my harder clues is that only general knowledge should be required to understand them, even if the fact itself isn’t well-known. For example, anyone from New York should know that AMAZIN (14A) is associated with the Mets, so it shouldn’t be surprising that a website all about the Mets is called Amazin’ Avenue. One other clue nicety here that might not be obvious: a factual balance between new pop culture (like 18A, 55A), older (40A, 25D), and historical (42A, 10D). I made sure that all my factual references could be quickly and authoritatively verified with Google, and passed that info along to Will with the puzzle. While some my new clues for uncapitalized answers also come from Web research (“Time-stretching” for 41D SLO-MO came from a Wikipedia article), I can often think of something fresh by just letting my mind wander. That’s where I got 56A and 1D, for instance. Will is obviously onboard with all of this thinking, since he kept about three-quarters of my clues, including all the ones cited above. In the 1,000-plus crosswords I’ve constructed and the 5,000-plus I’ve edited (for the New York newspaper Newsday and PuzzleSocial.com) since adopting Crossword Compiler in 2000, I’ve found that with careful grid patterning it’s never necessary to use obscurities, even for wide-open grids such as the 72-worder here. This sometimes requires that I check Google News and Google Books, to be sure that words I think are in common current use actually are. I look forward to the day where this fussiness will be standard procedure for constructors, so we can finally bid the OLEOs, OLIOs and ANILs of crosswordese an unfond farewell. Anyone wishing to throw bouquets or stones at me, or a constructor wishing to learn more about my “crud-free” approach to puzzlemaking, is welcome to contact me through my website www.StanXwords.com.

Foreign   Pushing for a Law Against Domestic Violence in China. Advertisement Last Thanksgiving, Kim Lee came down the stairs in her apartment in Beijing to see her former husband, Li Yang, standing in the living room. “I screamed,” she said. The couple had divorced nine months earlier in a blaze of publicity, after Mr. Li, the celebrity founder of Crazy English, a language school they ran together, admitted to physically abusing his American wife. Chinese women rarely publicize violence at the hands of their partners, but Ms. Lee posted images of her injuries online. Her forthrightness won her praise from women’s advocates as well as many ordinary Chinese, though some reacted with fury at how she lifted the lid on a sensitive topic. Ms. Lee’s experiences since then, however, have bolstered activists’ arguments that China is in urgent need of a national law on domestic violence. In interviews, Ms. Lee, a teacher, said that after they separated in 2011, Mr. Li more than once threatened her in text messages. “For our kids, you’d better pay attention to your safety!!!” read one message, she said. Another: “You need me to beat you again to make you better, you greedy, American psycho.” Mr. Li was “very busy” and would not respond to a detailed question list or otherwise comment, said his assistant, Anson Ke. So on her divorce, Ms. Lee applied for, and was granted, a protection order, the first reported in Beijing. The court order was for only three months and not detailed, simply warning Mr. Li that he would be arrested if he resorted to violence against her again. “But it did in fact protect me,” Ms. Lee said in an interview. Once he threatened to beat her to death, she reminded him that he could go to jail and he backed off, she said. “What it does is take out that painful step of having to get evidence” of an attack, which includes getting a hospital report and persuading the police to file a report, something difficult to do. “I just report the violence, and he’s dealt with,” she said. Last May, however, the order expired. And since then, despite multiple applications to the court, she has been unable to secure another. Activists say her situation illustrates why laws are needed that would define domestic violence, nixing the common argument that it is a “private matter,” raising the problem in the public eye, giving courts, the police, hospitals and other social organizations a clear legal mandate to assist victims, and standardizing important measures like protection orders. Some, issued elsewhere in the country, have ordered the perpetrator to keep a distance from the victim, but the approach is piecemeal. Currently, the Marriage Law and the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Women outlaw domestic violence, but they are vague, activists say. “There are too many systemic problems, too many loopholes. It’s just too easy to do it,” said Feng Yuan, a leading feminist and a founder of the Anti-Domestic Violence Network, which has campaigned for a comprehensive law for 15 years. Figures of the scale of the problem vary. Last year, Tan Lin, an official at the All-China Women’s Federation, said that 25 percent of women experienced violence in their marriage. But a study last year by Partners for Prevention, a United Nations program, found that 52 percent of about 1,000 Chinese men told researchers that they had been violent toward a woman. And protection orders, considered a crucial method of combating domestic violence worldwide, are still experimental in China. Courts try to keep them quiet, concerned that without the authority of a law and an established system of practical enforcement, they may fail, and the court may lose face, feminists say. Only recently did activists discover that another order was issued in Beijing several months before Ms. Lee’s. “Ms. Lee’s problems show that China needs to formalize protection orders,” said Ms. Feng. Because when it comes to violent partners issuing threats, “there is no law that says that judges must solve this problem.” “The courts are afraid of being overrun by applicants and of being unable to enforce the orders and therefore becoming a mockery, with the police not cooperating,” she said. In 2012, the National People’s Congress took proposals for a law defining and outlawing domestic violence into its legislative program. Every year, there have been a few deputies who try to push it forward. But after 15 years of lobbying, activists like Ms. Feng believe it’s still very low on the government’s agenda. “A lot of people trivialize the problem, but it’s not a trivial thing,” Ms. Feng said. Many countries, including in Asia, have such a law, making China a laggard. In China, action is “too slow,” she said. “It’s just too, too slow!” This year, feminists are gearing up to lobby again at the congress, which convenes next week. In 2003, the network submitted a draft law. Later, the All-China Women’s Federation, a government body, also submitted one. Ms. Feng does not expect a law this year. Maybe next year, if things move fast, she said. And 2015 is the 20th anniversary of the United Nations’ Fourth World Conference on Women, a landmark event held in Beijing that declared: “Women’s rights are human rights.” Despite the sense of urgency she and other women’s advocates feel, she says it’s important to get a good law, even if it takes time. “The question now is, How will they draft it? What are their priorities?” Ms. Feng said. Would, for example, protection orders be part of it? With the legislative process in China largely a black box, feminists can only hope to exert indirect influence. “We don’t have formal lobbyists like in the United States,” Ms. Feng said. She singled out three groups of people to approach: state leaders, heads of departments involved in drafting laws, and researchers and expert advisers. As a civil society organization, the network lacks access to the first group and only rarely can influence the second, but it can reach the third. The women’s federation has access to the first two; its leader, Shen Yueyue, is also a state leader. It comes down to a question of political will, said Ms. Feng. “I’d say there are just a handful of groups willing to pursue this issue.” Meanwhile, absent court protection and a law spelling out the crime, Ms. Lee worries. “He entered my home in the middle of the night,” she said. “I felt this was enough to warrant another application, since he obviously keeps threatening, scaring and trying to pressure me.” Her latest application was turned down on Dec. 23. She says she will keep trying.

Science   Test Is Improved Predictor of Fetal Disorders Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement A test that analyzes fetal DNA found in a pregnant woman’s blood proved much more accurate in screening for Down syndrome and another chromosomal disorder than the now-standard blood test, a new study has found. The promising results may change how prenatal screening for genetic diseases is done, though the test is costly and generally not yet covered by insurance for women at low risk. The study, published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the fetal DNA test was 10 times better in predicting cases of Down syndrome than the standard blood test and ultrasound screening, and five times better in predicting the other disorder, Trisomy 18. It also greatly reduced the number of false-positive results. It could prevent many women who would otherwise get the standard blood test from needing to confirm positive results with invasive tests like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, which can be stressful, much more costly and carry small risks of miscarriage. “Nine out of 10 women who are currently being referred for further testing would not need invasive tests,” said the lead author of the study, Dr. Diana Bianchi, the executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center’s Floating Hospital for Children. A positive result on the DNA screening would still need to be confirmed with invasive tests, because in more than half the cases in which the newer test predicted a disorder, there was no chromosomal abnormality. But a negative result would provide confidence that these two major chromosomal disorders are absent. “It’s a better mousetrap, there’s no doubt about that,” said Dr. Michael Greene, director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of an editorial about the study. “If the test is normal, the overwhelming probability is that your fetus is normal. There will be far fewer women who will be encouraged to have invasive testing, and, as a result, far fewer miscarriages.” The screen analyzes blood from women who are at least 10 weeks pregnant. At that point, about 10 percent of DNA in the blood will be fetal DNA from the placenta, Dr. Bianchi said. Dr. Bianchi is a paid advisory board member for Illumina, one of the laboratories that performs the test, which is known as the cell-free DNA test because the fetal DNA floats freely in the mother’s blood, not inside a cell. Illumina, which is based in San Diego, financed the study. Dr. Greene, an associate editor at The New England Journal of Medicine, said that the study “would sort of be purer from an academic perspective if somebody else pays for it,” but that companies are “the ones that are going to finance the research to get it to where it’s marketable.” He added, “We can’t have our cake and eat it too.” He said the journal had rejected other cell-free DNA studies, but considered this one well done. Experts said they expected the test would ultimately be offered to all pregnant women, but noted limitations. The test, costing $500 to $2,000, is not now typically covered by insurance for women at low risk for having babies with chromosomal abnormalities. Nor is it regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, because it is considered “laboratory developed,” to be used by the lab that created them and not sold to other labs or companies, Dr. Greene said. The test also appears to work inconsistently in very obese women. And it screens only for major chromosomal disorders and some sex-linked diseases. “This is a very good screening test for what it’s designed to screen for,” said Dr. Ignatia B. Van den Veyver, a prenatal geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine. But, she added, “we’re concerned that if women stop there, they miss the opportunity to have a diagnostic test like amnio that can detect other chromosomal abnormalities.” For now, this new technology, which became available in 2011, is primarily used for women deemed more likely to have babies with abnormalities because they are age 35 or older or have other risk factors. At least four companies offer the tests. Medical organizations have not recommended them for other women because of a lack of data showing they work in the general population. The new study, which involved 1,914 pregnant women from diverse backgrounds at 21 medical sites around the country, is the first large study to evaluate the cell-free DNA screen in average American women. Most women in the study were younger than 30, had conceived naturally, and were pregnant with their first child. Dr. Deborah A. Driscoll, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research, said that given this new evidence, “this should be a test that we can offer women universally.” The women received standard screening from their doctors, a blood test that identifies proteins or other biological markers associated with chromosomal disorders. Some also got ultrasounds examining the fetus’s neck for fluid associated with Down syndrome. Separately, and without knowing the results of the standard tests, technicians at the Illumina lab screened samples of the women’s blood for three copies of chromosomes instead of the normal two, seeking to identify chromosomes for Down syndrome, and for Trisomies 18 and 13, often fatal disorders. Researchers later checked whether babies were born with or without these conditions. In the study, the rate of false positives for Down syndrome was 0.3 percent with the cell-free DNA screening, while the rate for standard screening was 3.6 percent, 12 times higher. The false-positive rate for Trisomy 18 was 0.2 percent with the DNA screening; the rate with standard screening was three times that. Not everyone received standard screens for Trisomy 13, so complete comparisons could not be made. The DNA screen was correct in predicting Down syndrome 45.5 percent of the time, while the rate for standard screens was 4.2 percent. The DNA screen accurately predicted babies with Trisomy 18 almost 41 percent of the time, five times better than standard screening, whose rate was 8 percent. The cell-free DNA screen worked equally well in first, second or third trimesters, and in high- and low-risk women.” Since positive tests are often wrong, women should get positive findings verified with amniocentesis or C.V.S., experts aid. “The greatest risk is that the test will be oversold or over-interpreted and that women won’t take the step of an invasive diagnostic procedure before they do something irreversible like terminate a pregnancy,” Dr. Greene said. In the study, one of the five fetuses with Down syndrome was aborted, one of two with Trisomy 18 was stillborn, and the sole fetus with Trisomy 13 died in utero. The other five chromosomally abnormal babies were born alive. Jennifer Fontaine, 29, of Groveland, Mass., was not in the study, but chose cell-free DNA screening last year after standard screening showed an elevated risk of Trisomy 18 in her fetus. She was offered amniocentesis, but she said, “I wanted the noninvasive procedure.” Her DNA screen was negative for Trisomy 18, and her daughter, Morgan, was born healthy.

Sports   DeRozan’s Late Run Leads Raptors Over the Cavaliers. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSFEB. 25, 2014 DeMar DeRozan scored 16 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter, and the visiting Toronto Raptors won for the sixth time in seven games, defeating the injury-riddled Cleveland Cavaliers, 99-93, on Tuesday night. Terrence Ross hit a 3-pointer with 3 minutes 2 seconds left to put Toronto ahead by a point. DeRozan dunked on a baseline drive and added two free throws to give the Raptors a 94-91 lead with 1:23 remaining. He hit three more free throws in the final 27 seconds to put away the game. Kyrie Irving had 25 points and 9 assists for the Cavaliers. He played 45 minutes, including the entire second half, because of Cleveland’s depleted roster. The Cavaliers played without center Anderson Varejao (back) and guards Dion Waiters (knee) and C. J. Miles (ankle). BULLS 107, HAWKS 103 Mike Dunleavy scored 22 points, Joakim Noah had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and visiting Chicago held off Atlanta. Carlos Boozer had 17 points and 11 rebounds for the Bulls, and Kirk Hinrich scored 14 points, including six free throws in the final 44 seconds. The Bulls have won six of seven. Advertisement The Bulls led most of the second half but never pushed the advantage to double figures, and DeMarre Carroll sank a 3-pointer with 1:03 remaining to give Atlanta a 103-101 lead. But with 43.2 seconds left, officials reviewed and confirmed a questionable foul called on Carroll during a 3-point attempt by Hinrich. He made three free throws to put Chicago in front. WIZARDS 115, MAGIC 106 John Wall scored 27 points and Trevor Ariza added 22 to lead host Washington to its fourth straight win. Ariza hit all five of his 3-point attempts for the Wizards, who made 10 of 16 3-pointers. Marcin Gortat added 21 points and 10 rebounds. The Wizards, playing without Nene, who sprained a knee ligament on Sunday, moved to one game above .500. Victor Oladipo scored 26 points for the Magic, who lost their 16th consecutive road game. PACERS 118, LAKERS 98 Paul George scored 12 of his 20 points in the third quarter, Evan Turner had 13 points in his Pacers’ debut, and Indiana won at home. Kent Bazemore finished with a career-high 23 points and Jodie Meeks added 15 for the Lakers, who have the worst record in the West. The Lakers kept the game close for a time, trailing by 59-58 early in the third. But George scored 10 points in a decisive 14-5 spurt that gave Indiana an 80-68 lead with 2:58 left in the period. T’WOLVES 110, SUNS 101 Kevin Love had 33 points and 13 rebounds, and Minnesota rallied in the fourth quarter to win at Phoenix. Markieff Morris had 24 for the Suns. Advertisement BLAZERS 100, NUGGETS 95 J. J. Hickson had 25 rebounds and 16 points for Denver, but it was not enough as visiting Portland won behind Damian Lillard’s 31 points.

Travel   Lego Pieces Together a New Act. Advertisement While the thought of 3 million Legos may have parents instinctively rubbing the soles of their feet, executives at the Legoland park in Carlsbad, Calif., are smiling. They’ve used as many plastic pieces to create the Lego Movie Experience, a new attraction at the park that capitalizes on the recent success of Warner Brothers’ “The Lego Movie,” which has topped box office sales in its first two weekends and is quickly approaching the $200 million mark in domestic sales, according to Box Office Mojo. With assistance from filmmakers, the park’s master model builder team has recreated Middle Zealand, the Old West, Cloud Cuckooland, the Octane Tower and more than a thousand other models that inspired the story of the animated movie, in which Emmet, an average Lego figure, is mistakenly drafted to help save the world from an evil tyrant. The models, built using 91 new, rare, discontinued and current Lego sets, took more than 2,000 hours to assemble at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank and another six weeks to reassemble in the park. The walk-through attraction also features a soundstage broadcasting interviews with actors from the movie, including Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, along with clips from the film. Costumed characters from the movie also roam the area to take pictures with guests. Sets to build at home are sure to be on sale nearby.

Business   Turn Up the Music. Advertisement By Martin Ashwood-Smith Feb 28, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle from Martin Ashwood-Smith may be themeless, but it still has a fair number of references to music. We have HIGH NOTES soaring at the opera with 23 Across, the Hungarian composer known as ABBE Liszt at 43 Across and the pop singer AARON CARTER at 27 Down. It’s an all-out random grab bag of musical styles. There’s even a clue about a FLAUTIST. That particular musician, honored with a spot at 28 Down, is Sir James Galway, and it is noteworthy that his name is the second occurrence of the word “Galway” today. The other comes at 1 Down, with the clue “From Galway, maybe” for IRISH. This puzzle won me over, as the good ones always do, with smart clues. There’s QED for “Last thing seen by a proofreader” and “Text with Numbers” for TORAH. But my favorite had to be “Carlito’s way,” breaking out of the Italian with VIA. The toughest and most rewarding parts of the grid were the daunting 15-letter answers in the middle, and Martin, our constructor, has something to say about that. Who needs indie puzzles with their fancy new phrases and risqué words, when you can get a delightful disease-oriented 15-letter entry like MALARIA PARASITE in one of my New York Times crosswords? All kidding aside, I was hesitant about sending this puzzle to Will, precisely because of this 15-letter entry. Fortunately (for me), Will didn’t seem to have a problem with it, and I hope most solvers feel the same way! For today’s video, a clip of 1972 hit “Back Stabbers” by The OJAYS: What did you think?

Foreign   Questioning a Rising Star's Exoneration. Advertisement Advertisement By MANU JOSEPHFEB. 27, 2014 NEW DELHI — A “clean chit,” in most of the English-speaking world, may bring to mind a blank piece of paper of inexplicable purpose. But in India it very clearly means the exoneration of a public figure by an investigating agency. Probably the most famous “clean chit” was issued last year by a special investigation team to Narendra Modi, clearing the way for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party to nominate him — days before the advent of an inauspicious period in the Hindu calendar — as its prime ministerial candidate for the general elections due this summer. The team, appointed by the Supreme Court, had investigated the allegations that Mr. Modi was complicit in the communal riots of 2002 in the western state of Gujarat, in which more than a thousand people were killed. He was then, as he is now, the state’s chief minister. The manner in which the team and its chief, R.K. Raghavan, a retired police officer, conducted the investigation has been contentious. Now, a book by the journalist Manoj Mitta, “The Fiction of Fact-Finding,” accuses Mr. Raghavan of going to great lengths to shield Mr. Modi and of ignoring a wide spectrum of disturbing circumstantial evidence. One of the intriguing revelations of the book is the approximate time when Mr. Modi, according to his own statement to the investigation team, learned of one of the worst massacres in his state. On the morning of Feb. 28, 2002, in Ahmedabad, Gujarat’s largest city, a Hindu mob began to gather around Gulbarg Society, an affluent, mostly Muslim neighborhood. Fearing for their lives, scores of Muslims took shelter in the home of Ehsan Jafri, a former member of Parliament from the Indian National Congress party. Emboldened by an absence of any substantive police action, a common feature in the first days of the Gujarat riots, the mob began to attack. Even though the buildup and the attack spanned more than six hours and Mr. Jafri called a number of influential people for help, no help arrived. By 3 or 4 p.m., 69 people had died in the assault, including Mr. Jafri, who was hacked to pieces and burned. Advertisement Mr. Modi told the team he only learned of the episode “in the law and order review meeting held in the night.” That was at 8:30 p.m. Mr. Mitta is baffled that the investigation team did not challenge this claim. The Gujarat riots erupted after a horrific episode on the morning of Feb. 27, when a train compartment carrying Hindu pilgrims was burned by a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra. Fifty-eight people perished. Hours later, a low-level government officer, on instructions from his superiors — though it is not yet clear how high the chain went — wrote an unusual letter. It approved the transfer of most of the charred human remains to Jaydeep Patel, then a joint general secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or V.H.P., a rightist Hindu organization that would soon be at the center of the attacks against Muslims. The handover was illegal because, by law, only the families of the deceased may take custody of the bodies. Also, not all the bodies had yet been identified. Against the advice of senior police officers, Mr. Modi cleared the transfer of the bodies from Godhra to Ahmedabad, which was already tense and had a history of communal violence. The next day, some of the bodies were carried in a procession by the V.H.P., an event that attracted huge angry mobs that would soon unleash unspeakable violence. Mr. Modi told the investigation team that he did not know the bodies were handed over to the V.H.P., which is actually a sibling of his own party. The two groups are affiliated with the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, to which Mr. Modi still belongs. Mobile phone records among the court documents point to close coordination between government officials and the V.H.P. in the hours after the burning of the train. Yet Mr. Mitta says the investigation team did not pursue these leads. When I contacted Mr. Raghavan he declined to comment. Since the riots, Mr. Modi’s political power has risen dramatically among the Hindu electorate of Gujarat. In this reward lies, inadvertently, his indictment.

Home   Art Checks in at a London Hotel. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN KURUTZFEB. 26, 2014 Guests who check into Room 134 at the Ace Hotel London Shoreditch will find one wall covered with a color photograph by Richard Evans of autumnal countryside. In Room 113, Jonathan Barnbrook has created a large-scale piece inspired by neoclassical Victorian typography, above, while the walls of Suites 533 and 534 are hung with Justine Ashbee’s woven textiles in simple geometric patterns. The three artists, and nearly 100 others, were commissioned by the hotel to create pieces for each of the guest rooms and the public spaces. The work ranges from typography and photography to painting and street art, and will no doubt further the reputation of Ace hotels as trendy hangouts for the MacBook-toting urban creative class. It may also bring some positive coverage for the East London outpost. Months after it opened last September, a founder of the boutique hotel chain, Alex Calderwood, was found dead in one of the rooms. Information: acehotel.com/london.

Science   Ask Well: Medicines for Motion Sickness Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement A look at the drugs — some used by astronauts — that can relieve car, sea and space nausea. Reader Question • 608 votes It’s not a new medicine, but Dr. John P. Carey of Johns Hopkins University often recommends the scopolamine patch to his patients. The patch, sold under the brand name Transderm Scop, requires a prescription, and works by blocking brain signals that cause queasiness. The patch is placed behind the ear, where it slowly releases medication into the blood. This slow release helps minimize side effects, which can include drowsiness and dry mouth and other problems. NASA astronauts use the same medication, but because they need the drug to work at warp speed, they take it orally, as a pill. NASA is developing a nasal-spray version of the drug as well. Antihistamines can also be effective in curbing motion sickness. Common drugs in this class include dimenhydrinate (known as Dramamine) and meclizine (known as Bonine). Both are available over the counter. A prescription antihistamine favored by astronauts is promethazine (sold under such brands as Phenergan, Phenadoz and Promethegan), commonly given by injection for rapid relief of symptoms. In fact, it was an allergist who in 1947 discovered that Dramamine was effective against motion sickness. When he used the drug to treat a patient with hives, she was also cured of chronic motion sickness. The doctor then began a program called Operation Seasickness. He convinced the United States Army to test the effects of Dramamine on soldiers sailing to Germany aboard the transport ship General Ballou. Of the 389 soldiers who took the drug, 372 found their motion sickness disappear. But it’s important to keep in mind that Dramamine and Bonine are known to cause drowsiness, dry mouth and other side effects. Do you have a health question? Submit your question to Ask Well.

Sports   Super Rugby Expands Into Argentina. Advertisement Advertisement By EMMA STONEYFEB. 26, 2014 WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Starting in 2016, Argentina will get what it wanted: its own Super Rugby franchise, and a tighter bond with the heavyweight rugby nations in the Southern Hemisphere. Sanzar, the organization that runs the Rugby Championship competition and Super Rugby, announced last Thursday that it would be expanding from 15 to 17 teams, adding its first in South America. South Africa has also been guaranteed a sixth team, likely to be the Southern Kings, who were involved in Super Rugby in 2013 but lost out to the Lions for inclusion this year. Currently there are five franchises each in South Africa, New Zealand and Australia, the countries that make up Sanzar. The expansion of Super Rugby into Argentina follows its admittance into the well-established Tri-Nations competition, which was relabeled the Rugby Championship when the Pumas joined the annual Sanzar tournament in 2012. The former Pumas halfback Agustin Pichot was the driving force behind getting Argentina into the Rugby Championship and has been in the forefront of negotiations for Super Rugby inclusion, also. Advertisement The Sanzar chief Greg Peters said it was the logical step to take. “It’s a natural extension from their involvement in the Rugby Championship,” he said. “It makes logical strategic sense to include them in both of the Sanzar competitions.” The exact format of the new competition has yet to be confirmed, although a “preferred model” has been submitted for approval to South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. The expansion has not been universally accepted, however. Some coaches and players, who already travel huge distances for games, are worried that adding Argentina to the mix will affect their workload and performance. But the expansion will certainly open up greater opportunities for Argentina’s players and raise the standard of rugby played in that country — and played by the Pumas. Argentina’s players now have to leave their home country to secure professional contracts. The majority play in France and Britain. Only a few have played Super Rugby. Two Pumas, Tomás Leonardi and Nicolás Vergallo, played for the Southern Kings last year, while in 2009 Juan Martín Hernández signed with the Sharks, another South African franchise, but a back injury kept him out of Super Rugby in 2010. This year, Pumas lock Manuel Carizza is playing for the Stormers in South Africa, while Matias Diaz is the first Argentinean to play in New Zealand after signing a deal with the Highlanders. “A professional franchise in Argentina would be a dream come true for many of us — mainly from the point of view of the success of the national team,” said Carizza, who has played 41 tests for Argentina and spent nine years in France at the Top 14 clubs Biarritz and Racing Metro before moving to South Africa. “Personally, I am very happy here and still want to establish myself in the Stormers team and Super Rugby. But, with the bigger picture in mind, a Super Rugby franchise back home would mean a lot for our rugby.” Advertisement Playing in Super Rugby would also mean there are no clashes between their club commitments and international rugby. Argentines who are selected for the Pumas in the Rugby Championship are unavailable for their clubs at the start of the Top 14, English Premiership or Pro 12 Celtic League season, and team owners are becoming increasingly unhappy about that. It is one of the reasons Carizza headed to South Africa. “Racing Metro didn’t want to keep me, due to my international commitments,” he said. “I went back home for the Rugby Championship with the intention of looking for a new contract after the tournament. The Stormers were the first Super Rugby franchise to look at me, and I didn’t have to think twice about signing with them.” Diaz is a young prop embarking on professional rugby for the first time. He turned down offers from clubs in Europe to make the move to the Highlanders after making his Pumas debut last year. “I’m happy with the decision I made to put my professional career first before the money, because I had other offers from clubs that offered me more money,” said the 21-year-old, who played for Teqüe, a club in Mendoza, Argentina. “But I’ve made the best decision because I’m improving a lot as a rugby player here. I believe Super Rugby is the best place to start my professional career. It’s the highest standard you can get in rugby.” Enticing players like Diaz and Carizza, along with those whose French contracts are expiring in 2015, to return to Argentina for Super Rugby will be crucial if the new team is to be competitive. But Peters does not expect to see the entire Pumas national team suiting up in the Argentine franchise’s Super Rugby jerseys. “I don’t think that’s either likely or realistic,” he said. “There will still be players who are playing in Europe who play for the Pumas. Carizza, though, believes many Argentines will be eager to play on home soil. “I think all of our players would love to play Super Rugby,” said the lock, who made his Super Rugby debut last weekend. “For the last 15 years, the top Pumas players have gone to France because it’s easier and there’s always been a history of our players playing professional rugby in Europe. Advertisement “Now with Argentina playing in the Rugby Championship, it would make it easier or more viable for our top players to also play Super Rugby and, at the same time, represent their national team.” Diaz, who also made his Super Rugby debut over the weekend, hopes that if he is successful at the Highlanders, his countrymen will be further encouraged to play Super Rugby. “I know people are watching me and what I’m doing,” said Diaz, who was inspired to play rugby when the Pumas finished third at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. “I’m pleased because I’m working really hard to be a good example for anyone who wants to follow my path. “I don’t feel pressure because I’m the first from Argentina to play in New Zealand. I put pressure on myself to give my best for my team. I realize that this is one opportunity in life and I need to do my best.” A version of this article appears in print on February 27, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Travel   New Butler Services Buff Luxury Hotels. Advertisement In the race for an increasingly personalized luxury hotel experience, the butler may be the ultimate amenity. Since January, the new Langham, Chicago has employed a rotating staff of eight dedicated butlers for its three club floors. Carlos Carrera, the director of butler services for the hotel, said that the new generation of butlers specializes in services like unpacking and pressing and arranging daily details like dinner reservations and child care. At the Langham, the service costs an extra $75 per person daily for those on the club floors, where rooms are $470 to $1,500 per night. The hotel’s Infinity and Regent Suites, which go for $6,000 a night, include 24-hour butler service. At the St. Regis Hotels, the butler has morphed into a personal assistant. In a new initiative at the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in Florida, guests can request to have their closets stocked with clothing and accessories to try from Neiman Marcus. The butler then serves as a kind of personal shopper. “Our butlers today are more Pepper Potts in ‘Iron Man’ than Alfred Pennyworth in ‘Batman,’ ” said Anthony Ingham, the vice president of North American brand management for St. Regis Hotels and Resorts. About 40 percent of the butlers at St. Regis properties are women, he said. And, in a nod to a connected world, guests and butlers can communicate before, during and after a stay via eButler, the hotel’s dedicated online platform. Charles MacPherson, the owner of an eponymous academy for butlers and household managers and whose new book, “The Butler Speaks,” offers etiquette and entertaining tips, said he believes that even crusty Mr. Carson, the character on the series “Downton Abbey,” would approve of eButlers. “In person or electronically, the butler’s job is to personalize the guest experience and build a relationship of trust,” he said.

Business   High Tech. Advertisement By Ian Livengood & J.A.S.A. Crossword Class Mar 1, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE— This Saturday puzzle was a collaborative effort constructed by Ian Livengood and the crossword class at the J.A.S.A. (or Jewish Association Serving the Aging). Down below, Ian talks a bit about what the class does and what their creative process is like. What makes this puzzle stand out are the many technology-themed clues and answers. It gets started with a clue reading “Samsung Galaxy Note rival,” referring to the IPAD AIR, which the tech-savvy can use to RETWEET stories about GOOGLE GLASS. I particularly enjoyed the clue for that last one, which plays off the multiple meanings of the word bridge. Other high-tech elements at play include a radar SENSOR, an ADWARE detector and a nod to the carrier T MOBILE. Even the Hubble telescope gets a shout-out. Alongside all these, we have an example of texting shorthand that, to the untrained eye, looks like imparsable jibberish: KTHXBYE for “curt chat closing” at 18 Across. Its unusual combination of letters makes it tricky to spot. The crossers helped me fill in some of the blanks, but I started to second-guess myself when faced with the alien-looking “K–X–YE.” It makes you realize that, out of context, these abbreviations look like another language. Which is not to say that this puzzle has anything against foreign languages. From BIENVENUE to ARTE to ACH (nicht verdammt!), this puzzle is anything but monolingual. Even some of the English clues have a distinctly a worldly feel: Turkish LIRA, PAD THAI, double-decker buses, Italian PERONI, you name it. Now let’s hear from Ian: How does the J.A.S.A. crossword class work? Well, I suggested a few seed entries for the themeless puzzle — GOOGLE GLASS and IPAD AIR — and designed a conservative 72-word grid around ’em. The class then collaborated on the fill and clues. With the exception of ATAVIST (which isn’t even that bad), all the 7+ letter entries are either good to great, I think. A lot of our clues made the cut, too. I bet this puzzle plays easy if you know your tech products and almost certainly got slotted for a Saturday based on K THX BYE. Enjoy! For today’s clip, here’s Los Lobos’ rendition of the Mexican folk song, LA BAMBA:  What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Science   The Pasta Is Gluten-Free Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   Every so often I like to do a small roundup of gluten-free pasta products, to see if there is anything new and noteworthy on the market. This week was a good time to do it, as I’m in New York staying with my sister Melodie, who is gluten-intolerant. Melodie used to eat a lot of rice pasta until she became concerned with reports about arsenic in rice. It is cold in New York and we are mourning the death of our 95-year-old mother, and this calls for comfort food. So I went shopping for gluten-free pasta that was not made primarily with rice flour, and put my purchases to good use. Those purchases, by the way, were not cheap. The best price I could get (at Whole Foods) for one of the brands I liked the most, Andean Dream Quinoa Spaghetti (when you look closely at the ingredients you’ll see that it is made from a mix of quinoa and brown rice) was $3.50 for an 8-ounce package. Another brand I liked, truRoots Ancient Grain Spaghetti, made from quinoa, amaranth and brown rice, was $4.79 for an 8-ounce package. (I saw the same products at other shops for as much as $5.) I can get regular spaghetti for $1 to $1.69 a pound. So if you are on a budget, the gluten-free pastas I worked with this week will be splurges. I also tried cornmeal fettucine made by Le Veneziane ($3.99 for 8.8 ounces) and thought it was quite good. Brown-rice penne rigate by Delallo was also good, but I found the texture more brittle and stodgy than the other varieties. I think the shape is an important element here. Spaghetti had the best al dente texture of all the shapes, followed by fettucine. Gluten-Free Fettucine With Brussels Sprouts, Lemon and Ricotta: Creamy ricotta and Brussels sprouts add color and texture to this dish. Quinoa Spaghetti With Cauliflower, Almonds, Tomatoes and Chickpeas: Cauliflower is often matched with pasta in Italy; this version is all about texture. Gluten-Free Spaghetti With Baby Broccoli, Mushrooms and Walnuts: The walnuts add texture and flavor to this pasta dish. Gluten-Free Penne With Peas, Ricotta and Tarragon: A simple dish that is sweet with tarragon and a breeze to make. Gluten-Free Spaghetti With Shrimp, Kale and Tomatoes: A robust winter pasta with a spicy kick. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Real Madrid wore golden orange and struck six goals against Schalke in Germany. Cristiano Ronaldo looked imperious and scored twice. Karim Benzema looked predatory and scored twice. Gareth Bale looked no longer the new boy — and scored twice. And Ronaldo, particularly, might have had more. Madrid might have scored 10. And it is that number — la décima, as it is known — that has obsessed the club ever since May 2002, when Real won its ninth, and last, final in the tournament. Eleven coaching changes and a turnover of more than a billion dollars’ worth of playing talent has ensued since then. Always the quest has been la décima. Always the president of Real Madrid, Florentino Pérez, has justified the spending and the impatience for this title. Based on this year’s form, Bayern Munich would be the one power capable of standing in Real’s way. But in destroying Schalke on Wednesday night, Madrid exorcised some of its demons about playing on German soil. “I’m satisfied,” Carlo Ancelotti, the Italian coach of Real Madrid, said at the postgame news conference, once the 6-1 victory in Gelsenkirchen ended. “That was the perfect game. My players played with togetherness, and they played well. We weren’t thinking of our bad run in Germany, we were thinking about giving absolutely everything to win and resolve this tie as soon as possible.” Advertisement And Ancelotti arched an eyebrow. That is as animated as he gets, this man who has won the Champions League twice as a player and twice as a manager with A.C. Milan. Down the corridor in Gelsenkirchen, where Real had laid bare its record of winning only once in 25 previous Champions League matches in Germany, Bale, the new recruit to this strike force, was asked by reporters how it felt to be in this lineup. He said his earliest memory of the Champions League was watching Zinédine Zidane score against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final. That goal must have impressed countless boys just about to enter their teens, as Bale was at that time. It was a volley struck with startling power and sweetness — a volley with the ball at hip height when the ball approached him across his body from the left. Down in Wales, where Bale was growing up, the sight of that goal was an inspiration and an invitation to work harder than ever on his own skills. To one day join Real Madrid and to be coached by Zidane — who is now Ancelotti’s assistant — rounds out the dream. To then form the attack with Ronaldo and Benzema is beyond his boyhood imagination. “Our attacking trio,” said the master of understatement, Ancelotti, “are very dangerous.” Dangerous? They are devastating. Schalke is a decent side, fourth in the Bundesliga, which we were told last year was the new force that would dominate Europe for years to come. But Schalke is a young side, a vulnerable one and now a chastened one. Advertisement “Cristiano Ronaldo was everywhere,” said Benedikt Höwedes, the Schalke captain at the postgame briefing. “We saw exactly why he’s the world player of the year.” Indeed, Ronaldo was unplayable at times. The four (or was it five?) step-overs he made with bewildering speed and control during the run for his first goal were eclipsed by the gliding, graceful movement of his second. He also struck a post and missed twice. Yet it was the combinations from Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale that blitzed Schalke throughout this match. Reports say that Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s goal right at the end for Schalke was more than a match for any of the Real strikes. And it was. Huntelaar beat Iker Casillas with a volley in added time that was as perfect in many ways as the Zidane goal of 2002. It was uninhibited and excellent, but a consolation against a majestic opponent that by then was thinking of its next game, Sunday’s Madrid derby against Atlético in the Vicente Calderón Stadium. In the other match, the first leg of Galatasaray versus Chelsea was played to a 1-1 tie in Istanbul on Wednesday. It was a contest built around the intrigue of Gala’s center forward, Didier Drogba, competing against many of the Chelsea teammates with whom he shared the 2012 Champions League title. Drogba is still good and still athletic for a man in his mid-thirties. He has the guile and the know-how but is playing on experience rather than the power that he could once summon. Take sentiment out of it, and what was clear is that the Ivory Coast player is on his last lap. By the time he left the field, to an ovation from the Chelsea bench with 10 minutes left, the game was tied, 1-1. It finished that way, and so now everyone is talking up the return of Drogba to Stamford Bridge, where this contest must be settled. The odds favor the London side. They did what they had to in Turkey, aided and abetted by a gamble by Galatasaray Coach Roberto Mancini. Advertisement Seeking to surprise Chelsea, he fielded two Champions League rookies in Izet Hajrovic, a 22-year-old Bosnian, and Alex Telles, a 21-year-old Brazilian. By the time Hajrovic was taken out half way through the first half, Gala was a goal down. Emmanuel Eboué lost the ball to César Azpilicueta, who combined with Andre Schürrle down the left wing before cutting the ball back into the six-yard box for a comfortable side-footed goal by Fernando Torres. So open was Gala’s defense that Chelsea could have scored more. But once Mancini changed tactics, the balance swung in the other direction, and Galatasaray’s big Cameroon defender, Aurélien Chedjou, equalized following a corner kick. Where was Chelsea’s defense? John Terry and goalkeeper Petr Cech were possibly looking for a threat that wasn’t there — for Drogba — while Chedjou was left unmarked.

Travel   Wine on Wheels. Advertisement How often have cyclists wished for a bike basket that could securely hold a bottle of wine and two wineglasses for the duration of their ride? Probably not that often, though with the current proliferation of bike tours taking visitors closer to both nature and alcohol, they may soon be in high demand. It’s with that in mind that Clos du Bois, the winemaker, has partnered with C. Wonder, the bike maker, to create the Clos Cruiser, a basic C. Wonder City Bike model, outfitted with a limited-edition wicker basket with fau -leather loops perfectly sized to steady a bottle of wine and corkscrew, and two fabric pockets made to hold two stemless, shatter-proof, even recyclable Govino wine glasses. To assist the Sonoma County winery with promoting these limited-edition cruisers, the h2hotel, an eco-friendly establishment in nearby Healdsburg, Calif., is offering a special two-night stay package from March 1 through May 31. It includes the use of both the hotel and winery’s Clos Cruisers, a complimentary tasting and picnic at the winery, dinner at the hotel, custom bike maps and a monogrammed wine stopper. (Rates start at $680 for midweek dates, $880 for weekends.) Lucky, perhaps, that the winery is less than five miles from the hotel and the basket holds just one bottle.

Business   Oscar Double Features. Advertisement Administrivial Alert! There’s still time to register for the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, which will be held March 7 through March 9 at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott. Not only that, but spaces are still available for the annual Cru dinner. Click on the links for more details. By Alan Arbesfeld Mar 2, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — Break out the popcorn and settle into your seats, film buffs, because you’re in for a double feature. Today’s crossword has an Oscar them, just in time for the Academy Awards ceremony. The theme answers concocted by Alan Arbesfeld combine the titles of two films, each of which was nominated for Best Picture in the past. The clues tell you the year in which the films were nominated, but it is up to you to figure out the rest. Take 68 Across as an example: “Part of a line at O’Hare? [2002, 1976]” is a hint for CHICAGO TAXI DRIVER. Get the drift? Even some of the nontheme answers bask in the glow of the silver screen. At 8 Down, PST (for Pacific Standard Time) could have been described in any number of ways, but Alan decided to give it some razzle-dazzle with the clue “the Oscars are awarded on it.” Among the other Hollywood-centric answers we have DISNEY and the director Brian DEPALMA. But film isn’t the only art form covered, as we have a few nods to serious art and literature. For instance, there’s Caravaggio’s “The Sacrifice of ISAAC” and a line from Shakespeare’s Richard III: “A HORSE! My kingdom for a horse!” This was a really fun solve because of its playful theme and its array of really fresh words. To highlight a few, I would mention PINPRICKS, SEAWAYS and MAN ALIVE. I also liked the inclusion of TRADE WAR, though that one took me a while to figure out because I made a mess of the northeast corner. (I had erroneously guessed that “bread holder?” at 40 Across was “basket,” and it fit with all my crossers — at first. WALLET fit the bill much better.) Today’s video clip was inspired by a film that made up one-half of a double-feature theme answer, “Rocky.” What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.

Foreign   From 1939, Somerset Maugham’s List of Must-Reads. Advertisement Seventy-five years ago, the Paris edition published a list of books recommended by W. Somerset Maugham, the British novelist, to “help you live more fully.” Here is the top 10:  Poetry in three anthologies: ‘‘The Golden Treasury,” “The Oxford Book of English Verse” and Gerald Bullett’s “The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems.” If you don’t like them, Mr. Maugham said, don’t read them. “Every man is his own best critic. Whatever the learned say about a book, however unanimous they are in their praise of it, unless it interests you it is no business of yours,” he wrote. “That is counsel which I wish the high-school teachers of English in the United States would ponder. I doubt if anything is more responsible for the tons of trash read in America than the common school program of forcing good books upon boys and girls when they don’t want it. They acquire a permanent distaste for good literature. “Who is going to acquire the habit of reading for reading’s sake,” Mr. Maugham wrote, “if he is bidden to read books that bore him?” Mr. Maugham’s list is limited to English books. He said that he would not presume to recommend American books to American readers, though he could hardly believe that any American at all inclined to literature could have missed “Huckleberry Finn” or “Moby Dick,” Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” or the stories of Edgar Allan Poe.

Sports   Warriors Soar, Knicks Lag, and Boos Rain Down. Advertisement Advertisement By ZACH SCHONBRUNFEB. 28, 2014 With 8 minutes 26 seconds remaining in the first quarter of Friday’s game against the Golden State Warriors, Knicks Coach Mike Woodson called his first timeout. The Knicks already trailed, 13-6, but it was still early, and there was still a game plan. The tone — for either team — could still be determined. In time, though, the Warriors’ lead swelled to 12 points, then 21, then 27, rising like a departing jet without a moment of turbulence. The Knicks’ body language seemed to worsen with each Golden State 3-pointer (and there were 14 of them). The Knicks snarled when Tyson Chandler was ejected in the fourth quarter. They sulked when time wound down in another runaway defeat. The story of the 126-103 loss was not unlike that of the blowout they suffered a night earlier, against the Miami Heat, except that this was a home game, in front of an increasingly restless and uneasy crowd that showered the Knicks with boos at halftime and after the game. “Fire Woodson” chants circulated. The frustration — from the fans, the players, the coaches, everybody — all but dripped from the bridges traversing the top of the arena. “It’s not a mental thing,” said J. R. Smith, who finished with 17 points. “It’s a heart thing.” Carmelo Anthony, who scored 23 points, had a hard time disagreeing. “When we lose games, it’s embarrassing, like tonight,” Anthony said. “These games are embarrassing. I’m not going against what J. R. said, in terms of the heart, but in my opinion we’re just not very consistent.” Advertisement It did not help matters that the Knicks arrived jet-lagged after the late-night loss in Miami on Thursday to meet the young, fresh-legged Warriors, who are coached by the former Knicks guard Mark Jackson and are one of the N.B.A.’s best offensive teams. The Warriors poured in 38 points in the first quarter, shooting 56 percent, and they were just warming up. Their 126 points were 3 shy of the most the Knicks have allowed all season. The Knicks could have anticipated this, knowing how the Warriors’ All-Star leader, Stephen Curry, revels in performing on the type of stage that a Friday night game at Madison Square Garden offers. In Curry’s last game at the Garden, a year ago, he scored 54 points, with 11 3-pointers, one short of the N.B.A. record. Curry did not light up the Garden as he did that night last February, but he did finish with his fourth career triple-double: 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in 30 minutes. “It’s one of those arenas with history, and you look forward to playing here,” Curry said. “To play well and impact the game the way I wanted to definitely felt great.” The Knicks struggled for continuity on defense, often looking slow, overmatched or confused — or all of the above — while trying to keep up with Golden State’s prolific shooters. The Warriors scored 15 points in transition, and Woodson deemed the Knicks’ defensive effort in that area to be among the worst of the season. “We just didn’t get back and get matched,” Woodson said. When Golden State finished the first half on a 13-4 run, pushing its lead to 73-52, the crowd at the Garden sent the Knicks into the locker room with a shower of boos. The second half was not much better. If there was ever a lull in Golden State’s offensive attack, it was momentary. In the fourth quarter, Tyson Chandler flashed his frustration by shoving Golden State forward Marreese Speights as the two jogged up the court. The two players needed to be separated and were served with matching technical fouls. A few minutes later, Chandler, jawing at Speights again, earned his second technical and an automatic ejection. (He finished with 6 points and 12 rebounds). Advertisement Chandler said his frustration led to the ejection. “I figured we would be a little flat considering the travel schedule,” he said, “but I thought we would be able to do some things to slow them down.” With Chandler gone, Anthony quietly exited, too, calling it a night with four and a half minutes remaining and the Knicks trailing by 19. For a second night in a row, he watched the waning moments of a runaway loss from the bench. With each successive defeat, the Knicks’ chances for a playoff berth sink further, and thoughts inevitably turn to the future — namely what it might have in store for Anthony, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer. The Knicks’ on-court futility, coupled with their continued drama off the court, would seem to make the team less and less desirable to a player of Anthony’s caliber. Anthony, who played 37 minutes Friday, said he might get his right hand examined after receiving several slaps during the course of the game. He shrugged off his apparent fatigue from logging hefty minutes, night after night, as a bright spot for a dimming franchise. But even Anthony might begin to wonder what it is all for. “I keep saying we’ve got to figure it out, figure it out, figure it out,” Anthony said. “It’s time now where we should have it.” REBOUNDS Amar’e Stoudemire was given the night off after playing Thursday night in Miami. Last week, Stoudemire complained of soreness in his left knee, and Mike Woodson held him out of last Wednesday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Business   Echo, Echo. Advertisement By Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake Mar 3, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. MONDAY’S PUZZLE — Happy Monday, everyone. Who’s ready to get this week started? Today’s puzzle, constructed by Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake, features a slew of theme answers in which two similar-sounding words are placed one after the other, creating new phrases with often strange meanings. The words aren’t exact echoes per se, because the second word is one letter shorter than the first. (This means that once you figure out the first half of a theme entry you can confidently fill in the rest of the letters.) I was a big fan of 62 Across, in which the response to “memorize lines for a Shakespearean king?” was LEARN LEAR. Funny enough, I noticed that one of the non-theme answers had a similar thing going on. New Jersey Governor Chris CHRISTIE has repeated syllables in his name, but not quite in the “LEARN LEAR” format. It’s a Monday, so the puzzle is pretty straightforward in terms of solving. Still, a few clues required a few moments to stop and think, like REPO Man, EUGENE and ERSE. My favorite clue had to be “set of keys?” for PIANO, although honorable mention goes to LIRA, the former “capital” of Italy. For today’s video, here’s a clip of “IF WE Never Meet Again” by Elvis.

Foreign   In Our Pages: March 3. Advertisement   ROME — Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope this evening [March 2] on his sixty-third birthday. He took the name Pius XII. His election came at the end of the first day’s balloting, which is almost unprecedented in modern times and indicates that an overwhelming sentiment in his favor must have manifested itself from the opening of the Conclave. The new Pope is the first ever to have visited America. He spent several weeks on vacation in the United States in 1936. His knowledge of and sympathy with America is expected to lead to a strengthening of American representation in the College of Cardinals. In Vatican circles the greatest satisfaction is expressed at the choice and the new Pope is seen as eminently qualified by his experience, wide travel, and diplomatic training, to guide the Church safely through troubled times ahead. News of the election was broadcast throughout the world. The first news, ‘‘Holy Church has a new Pope,’’ flashed over the radio at 5:28 o’clock this afternoon, brought scores of thousands by car and on foot to Saint Peter’s Square to hear the official announcement and receive the new Pope’s blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 1964: New Drive Against Religion Launched by Kremlin MOSCOW — A major new antireligious campaign aimed at everyone from preschool toddlers to pensioners was made public today [March 2] by the Soviet Communist party. In a sweeping decree affecting journalists and other key groups, the party’s Central Committee ordered intensive nationwide efforts to overcome the ‘‘remnants of religion.’’ Published in detail in the Communist party newspaper ‘‘Pravda,’’ the decree called for stepped-up efforts to reach believers in their homes and places of work and to prevent dissemination of religious information among children of preschool age — ‘‘in every settlement and collective.’’ ‘‘Pravda’’ also took to task the party organizations that ‘‘live in peace’’ with party members who observe religious rites. ‘‘Pravda’’ told its readers it was necessary to eliminate ‘‘private-property instincts, nationalistic, religious and other prejudices’’ and it added: ‘‘Any religion or belief in the supernatural, in good and evil, in an almighty creator, is a distorted, antiscientific outlook on nature and science, is a negation of science and a substitution of scientific knowledge by fantastic myths and legends.’’ It said: “Any religion turns a man into a slave of the gods he invented.’’  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Sports   Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise. Advertisement Advertisement By ROB REISCHELMARCH 2, 2014 MILWAUKEE — Jason Collins is finally heading to his new home. He will be bringing along an ascending team that continues to play rock-solid basketball. Collins and the Nets downed the host Milwaukee Bucks, 107-98, on Saturday night to cap a 6-game, 11-day trip. The Nets displayed depth, getting 54 points from their reserves — more than half their total. “I can’t wait to go home,” said forward Andray Blatche, who had a huge night off the bench with 19 points and 13 rebounds. “It’s been a long trip.” It was also a successful one for the Nets (28-29), who went 4-2 on their trip and pulled within three and a half games of Toronto, which leads the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The Nets also improved to 18-8 since Jan. 1, their best record to start a calendar year since 2002, when their current head coach, Jason Kidd, led the team to the N.B.A. finals. Marcus Thornton, acquired from Sacramento in a trade on Feb. 20, led the way with 25 points, going 4 of 7 from 3-point range. He was one of five players with more than 10 points for the Nets, who held off a gutsy effort from a Milwaukee team that has the N.B.A.’s worst record (11-47). Advertisement “I think this is a very positive road trip,” Kidd said, “starting in Utah, but understanding that the last game is always the hardest because you’re thinking about getting home. And I thought the guys came out from the start and put ourselves in position to win the game.” Collins, the N.B.A.’s first openly gay active player, had a productive eight-minute stint in which he did the little things that have made him a favorite of Kidd’s, setting solid screens and playing strong defense while adding a veteran presence. On Monday, the Nets will host Chicago, giving Collins a chance to make his first appearance at Barclays Center since he signed a 10-day contract Feb. 23. “Yeah, looking forward to it,” Collins said. “I’ve obviously played in the arena before. It would be nice obviously to play in front of the home crowd.” Just 48 hours before the Nets’ latest win, Collins presented an autographed No. 98 jersey to the family of Matthew Shepard in Denver. Collins wears the number in honor of Shepard, a gay college student who was murdered in Wyoming in 1998. “It was special,” Collins said of his meeting with Shepard’s family. “It was a great meeting, and they’re a wonderful family, and I’m very fortunate to have that with them. I’ll say it was a great experience — again, very fortunate, very glad that they drove down from Wyoming and glad to have met with them.” The Nets, who were once 3-9 and later 5-13, are now making a push to host a first-round playoff series. They played without Kevin Garnett, who sat out with back spasms. “I don’t think it’s long term,” Kidd said. “This is his rest day, so we’ll get him some proper rest and see how he feels tomorrow.” Advertisement Without Garnett, the Nets’ bench stepped up in a big way. “That’s what we do,” Blatche said. “We just came out and did what we do.” Neither side played much defense in the first half, and the Nets carried a 55-53 lead into halftime. They shot 48.8 percent from the floor, and Milwaukee connected on 46.3 percent of its attempts. Nets guard Deron Williams went 3 for 5 from 3-point range and scored 13 of his 15 points in the first half. Thornton made all four of his field-goal attempts and had 13 points in nine minutes. The Nets stretched their lead to 77-72 through three quarters, with Shaun Livingston and Paul Pierce each scoring 6 points in the third. The Nets opened the fourth quarter on an 8-2 blitz to grab an 85-74 lead. Thornton and Blatche began the burst with baskets, and Mirza Teletovic drained a 3-pointer to force a Milwaukee timeout. The Bucks closed the gap to 4 points with five minutes remaining. But Thornton drained a pair of 3-pointers to stymie any hopes of a Bucks comeback. “We’re bringing the pieces together right now and trying to form some continuity going into the stretch run,” said Livingston, who had 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting. “For us to be as good as we want to be, we need to have all five guys playing as a unit,” he added. Now, after nearly two weeks on the road, the Nets are going home. And after sitting out most of the season and hoping for a chance to extend his career, Collins cannot wait. “To put into words right now, nah,” Collins said when asked what the last week had meant to him. “You know, obviously, things happen very quickly. The events over the past week have been very special.” A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise.

Business   Oscar Double Features. Advertisement Administrivial Alert! There’s still time to register for the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, which will be held March 7 through March 9 at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott. Not only that, but spaces are still available for the annual Cru dinner. Click on the links for more details. By Alan Arbesfeld Mar 2, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — Break out the popcorn and settle into your seats, film buffs, because you’re in for a double feature. Today’s crossword has an Oscar them, just in time for the Academy Awards ceremony. The theme answers concocted by Alan Arbesfeld combine the titles of two films, each of which was nominated for Best Picture in the past. The clues tell you the year in which the films were nominated, but it is up to you to figure out the rest. Take 68 Across as an example: “Part of a line at O’Hare? [2002, 1976]” is a hint for CHICAGO TAXI DRIVER. Get the drift? Even some of the nontheme answers bask in the glow of the silver screen. At 8 Down, PST (for Pacific Standard Time) could have been described in any number of ways, but Alan decided to give it some razzle-dazzle with the clue “the Oscars are awarded on it.” Among the other Hollywood-centric answers we have DISNEY and the director Brian DEPALMA. But film isn’t the only art form covered, as we have a few nods to serious art and literature. For instance, there’s Caravaggio’s “The Sacrifice of ISAAC” and a line from Shakespeare’s Richard III: “A HORSE! My kingdom for a horse!” This was a really fun solve because of its playful theme and its array of really fresh words. To highlight a few, I would mention PINPRICKS, SEAWAYS and MAN ALIVE. I also liked the inclusion of TRADE WAR, though that one took me a while to figure out because I made a mess of the northeast corner. (I had erroneously guessed that “bread holder?” at 40 Across was “basket,” and it fit with all my crossers — at first. WALLET fit the bill much better.) Today’s video clip was inspired by a film that made up one-half of a double-feature theme answer, “Rocky.” What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.

Foreign   From 1939, Somerset Maugham’s List of Must-Reads. Advertisement Seventy-five years ago, the Paris edition published a list of books recommended by W. Somerset Maugham, the British novelist, to “help you live more fully.” Here is the top 10:  Poetry in three anthologies: ‘‘The Golden Treasury,” “The Oxford Book of English Verse” and Gerald Bullett’s “The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems.” If you don’t like them, Mr. Maugham said, don’t read them. “Every man is his own best critic. Whatever the learned say about a book, however unanimous they are in their praise of it, unless it interests you it is no business of yours,” he wrote. “That is counsel which I wish the high-school teachers of English in the United States would ponder. I doubt if anything is more responsible for the tons of trash read in America than the common school program of forcing good books upon boys and girls when they don’t want it. They acquire a permanent distaste for good literature. “Who is going to acquire the habit of reading for reading’s sake,” Mr. Maugham wrote, “if he is bidden to read books that bore him?” Mr. Maugham’s list is limited to English books. He said that he would not presume to recommend American books to American readers, though he could hardly believe that any American at all inclined to literature could have missed “Huckleberry Finn” or “Moby Dick,” Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” or the stories of Edgar Allan Poe.

Sports   Warriors Soar, Knicks Lag, and Boos Rain Down. Advertisement Advertisement By ZACH SCHONBRUNFEB. 28, 2014 With 8 minutes 26 seconds remaining in the first quarter of Friday’s game against the Golden State Warriors, Knicks Coach Mike Woodson called his first timeout. The Knicks already trailed, 13-6, but it was still early, and there was still a game plan. The tone — for either team — could still be determined. In time, though, the Warriors’ lead swelled to 12 points, then 21, then 27, rising like a departing jet without a moment of turbulence. The Knicks’ body language seemed to worsen with each Golden State 3-pointer (and there were 14 of them). The Knicks snarled when Tyson Chandler was ejected in the fourth quarter. They sulked when time wound down in another runaway defeat. The story of the 126-103 loss was not unlike that of the blowout they suffered a night earlier, against the Miami Heat, except that this was a home game, in front of an increasingly restless and uneasy crowd that showered the Knicks with boos at halftime and after the game. “Fire Woodson” chants circulated. The frustration — from the fans, the players, the coaches, everybody — all but dripped from the bridges traversing the top of the arena. “It’s not a mental thing,” said J. R. Smith, who finished with 17 points. “It’s a heart thing.” Carmelo Anthony, who scored 23 points, had a hard time disagreeing. “When we lose games, it’s embarrassing, like tonight,” Anthony said. “These games are embarrassing. I’m not going against what J. R. said, in terms of the heart, but in my opinion we’re just not very consistent.” Advertisement It did not help matters that the Knicks arrived jet-lagged after the late-night loss in Miami on Thursday to meet the young, fresh-legged Warriors, who are coached by the former Knicks guard Mark Jackson and are one of the N.B.A.’s best offensive teams. The Warriors poured in 38 points in the first quarter, shooting 56 percent, and they were just warming up. Their 126 points were 3 shy of the most the Knicks have allowed all season. The Knicks could have anticipated this, knowing how the Warriors’ All-Star leader, Stephen Curry, revels in performing on the type of stage that a Friday night game at Madison Square Garden offers. In Curry’s last game at the Garden, a year ago, he scored 54 points, with 11 3-pointers, one short of the N.B.A. record. Curry did not light up the Garden as he did that night last February, but he did finish with his fourth career triple-double: 27 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists in 30 minutes. “It’s one of those arenas with history, and you look forward to playing here,” Curry said. “To play well and impact the game the way I wanted to definitely felt great.” The Knicks struggled for continuity on defense, often looking slow, overmatched or confused — or all of the above — while trying to keep up with Golden State’s prolific shooters. The Warriors scored 15 points in transition, and Woodson deemed the Knicks’ defensive effort in that area to be among the worst of the season. “We just didn’t get back and get matched,” Woodson said. When Golden State finished the first half on a 13-4 run, pushing its lead to 73-52, the crowd at the Garden sent the Knicks into the locker room with a shower of boos. The second half was not much better. If there was ever a lull in Golden State’s offensive attack, it was momentary. In the fourth quarter, Tyson Chandler flashed his frustration by shoving Golden State forward Marreese Speights as the two jogged up the court. The two players needed to be separated and were served with matching technical fouls. A few minutes later, Chandler, jawing at Speights again, earned his second technical and an automatic ejection. (He finished with 6 points and 12 rebounds). Advertisement Chandler said his frustration led to the ejection. “I figured we would be a little flat considering the travel schedule,” he said, “but I thought we would be able to do some things to slow them down.” With Chandler gone, Anthony quietly exited, too, calling it a night with four and a half minutes remaining and the Knicks trailing by 19. For a second night in a row, he watched the waning moments of a runaway loss from the bench. With each successive defeat, the Knicks’ chances for a playoff berth sink further, and thoughts inevitably turn to the future — namely what it might have in store for Anthony, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer. The Knicks’ on-court futility, coupled with their continued drama off the court, would seem to make the team less and less desirable to a player of Anthony’s caliber. Anthony, who played 37 minutes Friday, said he might get his right hand examined after receiving several slaps during the course of the game. He shrugged off his apparent fatigue from logging hefty minutes, night after night, as a bright spot for a dimming franchise. But even Anthony might begin to wonder what it is all for. “I keep saying we’ve got to figure it out, figure it out, figure it out,” Anthony said. “It’s time now where we should have it.” REBOUNDS Amar’e Stoudemire was given the night off after playing Thursday night in Miami. Last week, Stoudemire complained of soreness in his left knee, and Mike Woodson held him out of last Wednesday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

Business   Echo, Echo. Advertisement By Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake Mar 3, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. MONDAY’S PUZZLE — Happy Monday, everyone. Who’s ready to get this week started? Today’s puzzle, constructed by Andrea Carla Michaels and Michael Blake, features a slew of theme answers in which two similar-sounding words are placed one after the other, creating new phrases with often strange meanings. The words aren’t exact echoes per se, because the second word is one letter shorter than the first. (This means that once you figure out the first half of a theme entry you can confidently fill in the rest of the letters.) I was a big fan of 62 Across, in which the response to “memorize lines for a Shakespearean king?” was LEARN LEAR. Funny enough, I noticed that one of the non-theme answers had a similar thing going on. New Jersey Governor Chris CHRISTIE has repeated syllables in his name, but not quite in the “LEARN LEAR” format. It’s a Monday, so the puzzle is pretty straightforward in terms of solving. Still, a few clues required a few moments to stop and think, like REPO Man, EUGENE and ERSE. My favorite clue had to be “set of keys?” for PIANO, although honorable mention goes to LIRA, the former “capital” of Italy. For today’s video, here’s a clip of “IF WE Never Meet Again” by Elvis. What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle.

Foreign   In Our Pages: March 3. Advertisement   ROME — Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli was elected Pope this evening [March 2] on his sixty-third birthday. He took the name Pius XII. His election came at the end of the first day’s balloting, which is almost unprecedented in modern times and indicates that an overwhelming sentiment in his favor must have manifested itself from the opening of the Conclave. The new Pope is the first ever to have visited America. He spent several weeks on vacation in the United States in 1936. His knowledge of and sympathy with America is expected to lead to a strengthening of American representation in the College of Cardinals. In Vatican circles the greatest satisfaction is expressed at the choice and the new Pope is seen as eminently qualified by his experience, wide travel, and diplomatic training, to guide the Church safely through troubled times ahead. News of the election was broadcast throughout the world. The first news, ‘‘Holy Church has a new Pope,’’ flashed over the radio at 5:28 o’clock this afternoon, brought scores of thousands by car and on foot to Saint Peter’s Square to hear the official announcement and receive the new Pope’s blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter’s Basilica. 1964: New Drive Against Religion Launched by Kremlin MOSCOW — A major new antireligious campaign aimed at everyone from preschool toddlers to pensioners was made public today [March 2] by the Soviet Communist party. In a sweeping decree affecting journalists and other key groups, the party’s Central Committee ordered intensive nationwide efforts to overcome the ‘‘remnants of religion.’’ Published in detail in the Communist party newspaper ‘‘Pravda,’’ the decree called for stepped-up efforts to reach believers in their homes and places of work and to prevent dissemination of religious information among children of preschool age — ‘‘in every settlement and collective.’’ ‘‘Pravda’’ also took to task the party organizations that ‘‘live in peace’’ with party members who observe religious rites. ‘‘Pravda’’ told its readers it was necessary to eliminate ‘‘private-property instincts, nationalistic, religious and other prejudices’’ and it added: ‘‘Any religion or belief in the supernatural, in good and evil, in an almighty creator, is a distorted, antiscientific outlook on nature and science, is a negation of science and a substitution of scientific knowledge by fantastic myths and legends.’’ It said: “Any religion turns a man into a slave of the gods he invented.’’  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Sports   Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise. Advertisement Advertisement By ROB REISCHELMARCH 2, 2014 MILWAUKEE — Jason Collins is finally heading to his new home. He will be bringing along an ascending team that continues to play rock-solid basketball. Collins and the Nets downed the host Milwaukee Bucks, 107-98, on Saturday night to cap a 6-game, 11-day trip. The Nets displayed depth, getting 54 points from their reserves — more than half their total. “I can’t wait to go home,” said forward Andray Blatche, who had a huge night off the bench with 19 points and 13 rebounds. “It’s been a long trip.” It was also a successful one for the Nets (28-29), who went 4-2 on their trip and pulled within three and a half games of Toronto, which leads the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The Nets also improved to 18-8 since Jan. 1, their best record to start a calendar year since 2002, when their current head coach, Jason Kidd, led the team to the N.B.A. finals. Marcus Thornton, acquired from Sacramento in a trade on Feb. 20, led the way with 25 points, going 4 of 7 from 3-point range. He was one of five players with more than 10 points for the Nets, who held off a gutsy effort from a Milwaukee team that has the N.B.A.’s worst record (11-47). Advertisement “I think this is a very positive road trip,” Kidd said, “starting in Utah, but understanding that the last game is always the hardest because you’re thinking about getting home. And I thought the guys came out from the start and put ourselves in position to win the game.” Collins, the N.B.A.’s first openly gay active player, had a productive eight-minute stint in which he did the little things that have made him a favorite of Kidd’s, setting solid screens and playing strong defense while adding a veteran presence. On Monday, the Nets will host Chicago, giving Collins a chance to make his first appearance at Barclays Center since he signed a 10-day contract Feb. 23. “Yeah, looking forward to it,” Collins said. “I’ve obviously played in the arena before. It would be nice obviously to play in front of the home crowd.” Just 48 hours before the Nets’ latest win, Collins presented an autographed No. 98 jersey to the family of Matthew Shepard in Denver. Collins wears the number in honor of Shepard, a gay college student who was murdered in Wyoming in 1998. “It was special,” Collins said of his meeting with Shepard’s family. “It was a great meeting, and they’re a wonderful family, and I’m very fortunate to have that with them. I’ll say it was a great experience — again, very fortunate, very glad that they drove down from Wyoming and glad to have met with them.” The Nets, who were once 3-9 and later 5-13, are now making a push to host a first-round playoff series. They played without Kevin Garnett, who sat out with back spasms. “I don’t think it’s long term,” Kidd said. “This is his rest day, so we’ll get him some proper rest and see how he feels tomorrow.” Advertisement Without Garnett, the Nets’ bench stepped up in a big way. “That’s what we do,” Blatche said. “We just came out and did what we do.” Neither side played much defense in the first half, and the Nets carried a 55-53 lead into halftime. They shot 48.8 percent from the floor, and Milwaukee connected on 46.3 percent of its attempts. Nets guard Deron Williams went 3 for 5 from 3-point range and scored 13 of his 15 points in the first half. Thornton made all four of his field-goal attempts and had 13 points in nine minutes. The Nets stretched their lead to 77-72 through three quarters, with Shaun Livingston and Paul Pierce each scoring 6 points in the third. The Nets opened the fourth quarter on an 8-2 blitz to grab an 85-74 lead. Thornton and Blatche began the burst with baskets, and Mirza Teletovic drained a 3-pointer to force a Milwaukee timeout. The Bucks closed the gap to 4 points with five minutes remaining. But Thornton drained a pair of 3-pointers to stymie any hopes of a Bucks comeback. “We’re bringing the pieces together right now and trying to form some continuity going into the stretch run,” said Livingston, who had 14 points on 7-of-11 shooting. “For us to be as good as we want to be, we need to have all five guys playing as a unit,” he added. Now, after nearly two weeks on the road, the Nets are going home. And after sitting out most of the season and hoping for a chance to extend his career, Collins cannot wait. “To put into words right now, nah,” Collins said when asked what the last week had meant to him. “You know, obviously, things happen very quickly. The events over the past week have been very special.” A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Bolstered by Their Depth, Nets Head Home on the Rise.

Business   Spirit of Experiment. Advertisement By Bruce Haight and Peter A. Collins Mar 4, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — Bifocals, the lightning rod and the odometer. These are just a few of the everyday objects that BENJAMIN FRANKLIN invented when he wasn’t busy with his other hobbies. Like publishing Poor Richard’s Almanac. Or developing the postal service. Or, oh yeah, fostering American independence. Reading his full roster of accomplishments will make you feel like a dolt. Then again, you may come away inspired by that spirit of innovation, as today’s constructors evidently were. Indeed, Bruce Haight and Peter A. Collins have come up with a highly original form of presentation for today’s puzzle. At first glance you’ll notice that it’s an asymmetrical grid, which is uncommon enough, but look a little bit closer and you’ll see that the black squares are arranged to depict an image that relates to today’s theme. That image is of A KITE, related to that BRAINY fellow’s famous ELECTRICITY experiment during a lightning storm in 1752. I’ll pass it over to Bruce and Pete to tell you how this idea came about. Bruce writes: “Pete Collins and I have been friends since childhood, when our families used to vacation together on a small lake in Wisconsin. He agreed to mentor me in 2012 when I got interested in constructing crosswords. I got this electricity puzzle idea when I was “block-doodling” one day on the computer and noticed I could make a pretty realistic looking kite. My wife Liz suggested I tie in Ben Franklin so I worked some lightning bolts into the grid. The first version had BEN and KEY attached to the bottom of the kite string, but that did not fly. I loved the grid art though, so I shipped the puzzle to Pete to see if he could get this project off the ground — I’ll let him finish the story. Thanks for everything, Pete!” Pete adds: “Bruce and I share an interest in ‘grid art.’ I think this grid is particularly nice, with the kite and lightning bolts. But make no mistake — this one is Bruce’s baby (I’m just the godfather). We went back and forth several times, with the kite being oriented various ways, before we settled on this arrangement. In addition to the grid art, I really like the highly unusual diagonal symmetry — and the three pairs of themed answers. And our reward for getting this puzzle published? We get three Benjamins!” Putting aside the theme for a moment, this puzzle also boats a high number of fresh answers, among them DR DOOM, FUR COAT, PHENOMS and OLD TIMER, which made for a fun solve. For today’s clip, here’s a video of the armonica, the musical instrument invented by Franklin.  What did you think? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.  Deb Amlen is a humorist and puzzle constructor whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Onion and Bust Magazine.

Business   Bond Market in China May See First Local Default. Advertisement Updated, 8:18 p.m. | HONG KONG — Chinese companies have been selling record amounts of bonds on the domestic market in recent years. But in a sign that market forces have not been at work, analysts have been quick to point out, none of them have ever had a default. That may be about to change. A small company in Shanghai has said it is unlikely to meet a Friday deadline for an annual interest payment, putting it at risk of becoming the first company to default in China’s domestic bond market, which could have broader ramifications. The Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company, which makes solar cells and panels, issued a stock exchange announcement on Tuesday saying that “due to various uncontrollable factors” the company was unlikely to be able to meet the payment of 89.8 million renminbi, or $14.6 million, on a bond of one billion renminbi that it sold to domestic investors in 2012. Chaori said it had come up with only about 4 million renminbi, meaning that unless it receives a bailout or generates fresh cash, it will default. As of Wednesday, the company did not appear any closer to resolving its debt problem. “Since the official announcement yesterday as regards our debt repayment situation, there has been no additional development thus far,” said Liu Tielong, a spokesman for Chaori. Until now, investors’ concerns about potential problems with debt accumulation in China have tended to focus on ever-expanding local government borrowing or the rapid, often unwieldy, growth of the shadow banking sector. But the prospect of a default in the domestic corporate bond market introduces an additional dimension to assessing the overall picture of China’s indebtedness. “In China’s case, the focus is on the knock-on effects of one default and whether those would prove to be detrimental to the overall bond market,” said Ted Osborn, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong who specializes in debt restructuring. “If one of the domestic bond issuers were to default, would that cause the market to teeter or to crash?” Corporate bonds fell on Wednesday in China. The ChinaBond New Composite Total Return Index, a broad indicator of the market, was down 0.16 percent. Over the last decade, China’s corporate bond market has grown from almost nothing to become the third largest in the world, trailing only those of the United States and Japan, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements. Total corporate bonds outstanding have risen to 8.5 trillion renminbi at the end of last year, or about $1.4 trillion, from about 500 billion renminbi at the end of 2005, according to official figures were compiled by the Asian Development Bank. Despite its tremendous size, China’s domestic bond market remains underdeveloped. It is still largely closed to foreign investors, and critics say it does a poor job of pricing in risk. The lack of defaults in China’s domestic debt markets has been unusual, even by the country’s own standards. Chinese companies that have sold bonds denominated in dollars to international investors in offshore debt markets have defaulted in the past. A default last year by Suntech Power was a notable example in the solar industry. In this regard, analysts see a potential onshore bond default as having positive implications, a sign that the market is maturing. “We think it’s a good thing, as a normal economy needs defaults to better price bonds and other debt products,” Ting Lu, a China economist, and other analysts at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit wrote on Wednesday in a research note. “Defaults of some debt products are not on a similar scale to a collapse of a major financial institution.” Still, officials have been wary of corporate defaults, not least because they can lead to layoffs and social instability as businesses are shut or otherwise restructured. This is especially true when state-owned companies are involved. Chaori, which is not run by the government, encountered problems making an interest payment on its bonds in early 2013. But at the time, local officials in Shanghai and the company’s state-backed bond underwriter made a deal to cover principal payments so Chaori could meet its interest payments, according to local news media and analyst reports. Given the Friday deadline, a bailout is not out of the question for Chaori. But several analysts on Wednesday interpreted the default as a fait accompli. Letting Chaori default “will help go some way to correct the moral hazard problem in China’s financial sector, and that is positive for the long-term development of the onshore bond market,” Zhiwei Zhang, a China economist at Nomura, wrote on Wednesday in a research note. Because the company has been struggling financially for a while, “the immediate repercussions in the bond market may not be systemic,” he added. “Nonetheless, we continue to expect more credit defaults in the corporate, local government financing vehicle and shadow banking sectors this year.” Hilda Wang contributed reporting. A version of this article appears in print on 03/06/2014, on page B3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Solar Company Warns It May Be First to Default in China’s Bond Market.

Foreign   Bangalore Welcomes a Later Last Call. Advertisement BANGALORE — As India’s hub of globalization, Bangalore has long had one major obstacle in its quest to be a truly cosmopolitan city: a lack of nightlife, thanks to a stringent city ordinance mandating an 11:30 p.m. closing time for its many bars and restaurants. On weekends, a familiar scene would play out, starting with the bartenders and waiting staff issuing the last call for orders even before 11 p.m. After a little while, the music would stop and the bouncers would start closing in on those trying to linger. Tales of ambition and youth from India’s outsourcing hub. Even as the staff tried to hurry the guests out, the police would arrive. The customers would start arguing with the staff and the police, but in the end, they would lose. Finally, long before the Cinderella hour, the party would be over. This past weekend, K.J. George, the home minister of the state of Karnataka, of which Bangalore is the capital, said he would allow the city’s bars and restaurants a three-month trial run to extend operations until 1 a.m., as residents were clamoring for the change. The new closing time is likely to go into effect within the next two weeks. Not even the recent announcements of free public Wi-Fi and electric buses on the roads has generated as much excitement in what is known as India’s pub capital, home to a huge population of young professionals. The residents of Bangalore will now be able to enjoy a nightlife like their friends do in Mumbai and Delhi. “Bangalore has finally grown up and got a life,” said Ashwin Nair, 28, a marketing executive at a multinational engineering company who finishes work at 8:30 p.m. and has to scramble to catch a drink with friends. “There will be time to drink a couple of beers and have a decent conversation without worrying about being hustled out,” he said. In the 1980s and 1990s, coinciding with a boom in outsourcing and call centers in Bangalore, pubs, discos and bars proliferated in the city.  They stayed open until late to accommodate young employees working around the clock.  The bars were relaxed spaces where women could drink in public – unheard of even in bigger cities like Delhi at the time – and where bouncers and condom vending machines came into vogue. The proliferation of pubs and bars triggered resentment among older and middle-class residents who believed that the drinking and dancing would destroy Indian culture and ruin their children. In the last decade, however, the city’s understaffed police force has brought in a series of restrictions on such businesses, citing an archaic 1960s law.  So besides forcing pubs and restaurants to shut down at 11:30 p.m., the police have severely curtailed the playing of loud music, dancing and bartending by female employees. “Imagine, the government was constantly telling full-grown, tax-paying adults how to behave,” said Siddharth Poojari, owner of a restaurant chain and a high-profile bar in the upmarket UB City Mall. Mindful that the government will be watching them closely during this trial period, bar owners and restaurateurs said they would take steps to make Bangalore safe even with the extended hours. A few bar owners are talking of introducing in-house breathalyzer tests so that customers can check their blood alcohol levels before taking off.  Others are discussing partnerships with cab companies to ferry customers home. “It is all for the collective good,” Mr. Poojari said.  “We are on a three-month probation; we have to prove that we can behave responsibly.” Young people like Sanjana Nanjappa, 24, a behavior therapist who lives with her parents, will have to figure out how to calm parental fears about staying out later, and that’s where the city authorities can help. Ms. Nanjappa said her parents would feel more reassured if other services like transport, including public transit and taxis, and the police adjusted to the late hours as well. Bangalore’s police force has received $830,000 and approval to hire an additional 2,500 officers from the city government. “We are working out a plan, and we are confident we will handle it well,” said Raghavendra H. Auradkar, the Bangalore police commissioner. Saritha Rai sometimes feels she is the only person living in Bangalore who was actually raised here.

Science   Is Breast-Feeding Really Better? Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Many women who are unable to breast-feed feel guilty about it and worry they may be depriving their children of a range of benefits. Groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend six months of exclusive breast-feeding for all infants, citing studies that show breast milk is easily digestible and has nutrients that are superior to or absent from infant formulas, including immunological substances that reduce rates of infection and fatty acids important in brain development. But now a new study suggests that many of the long-term benefits attributed to breast-feeding may be an effect not of breast-feeding or breast milk itself but of the general good health and prosperity of women who choose to breast-feed. Researchers at Ohio State University compared 1,773 sibling pairs, one of whom had been breast-fed and one bottle-fed, on 11 measures of health and intellectual competency. The children ranged in age from 4 to 14 years. The researchers recorded various health and behavioral outcomes in the sibling pairs, including body mass index, obesity, asthma, hyperactivity, reading comprehension, math ability and memory-based intelligence. The study, published online in Social Science & Medicine, found no statistically significant differences between the breast-fed and bottle-fed siblings on any of these measures. By studying “discordant” siblings — one of whom had been breast-fed and the other not — the authors sought to minimize the possibility that racial, socioeconomic, educational or other differences between families could affect the results. Many earlier studies on breast-feeding failed to control for such factors, they say. Campaigns to increase the rate of breast-feeding have been highly successful in recent years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about three-quarters of American mothers now breast-feed, compared with less than two-thirds in 2000, and about 49 percent are still breast-feeding at six months, compared with 34 percent in 2000. Yet despite this increase, researchers have consistently found large socioeconomic and racial disparities in breast-feeding rates. A C.D.C. survey in 2008 found that 75 percent of white infants and 59 percent of black infants were ever breast-fed, and in 2013, the agency reported that 47 percent of white babies but only 30 percent of black babies were still being breast-fed at 6 months. Compared with bottle-fed infants, breast-fed babies are more likely to be born into families with higher incomes, have parents with higher educational attainments, and live in safer neighborhoods with easier access to health care services. Still, sibling studies such as this latest one do not solve all the problems of bias. “We were not able to control for everything that could affect what would make a mom breast-feed one child and not the other,” said the lead author, Cynthia G. Colen, an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio State. “But we did control for premature birth, birth order, the age of the mother, and whether she was working when she had one infant and not when she had the other.” Geoff Der, a statistician at the University of Glasgow who has worked with the same data in previous studies, said that the findings in the present study were robust and the authors’ method for eliminating selection bias was powerful. He had reassuring words for women who do not or cannot breast-feed. “In a society with a clean water supply and modern formulas,” he said, “a woman who isn’t able to breast-feed shouldn’t be feeling guilty, and the likelihood that there’s any harm to the baby is pretty slim.” Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Travel   In Newark Airport Lounge, Israeli Art. Advertisement A new lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport is providing an artistic – -and kosher — respite for travelers to Israel who might be looking for more than just free Wi-Fi and contemporary furniture while they wait. “Art & Lounge,” in Newark’s Terminal B, serves as place to relax but also a gallery for a rotation of Israeli artists, featuring installations curated by Lital Dotan and Eyal Perry, two artists from Tel Aviv who have made a life’s practice of turning their homes into live exhibition spaces, and exhibition spaces into their home. (They now operate the Glasshouse Project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which they describe as an “art-life-lab.”) The couple’s first show at the Newark lounge, called “Window Seat,” replaces the typical nonstop news broadcast on lounge televisions with a metaphorical airplane window, a video presentation of several landscapes created by four artists: Miriam Cabessa, Oded Hirsch, Shay Kun and Tom Pnini, who each contributed other works as well. “In the frame of a house,” the curators explained in a statement about the exhibition, “a window seat has romantic associations, as they are often identified with luxury of spare time.” In airplanes, they added, the window seat serves as a dimension of psychological space and in an airport terminal it is “a space of transition and restlessness, and manifests a state of in-between, which is why ‘Window Seat’ offers an invitation to stay, pause, reflect, before moving on to the next destination.” An assortment of healthy and kosher foods, picked by Shmulik Markus, a chef and the chief executive of Restotel, an Israeli hospitality and restaurant company, are also available to visitors, along with a selection of wine and beer. El Al Airlines has been the first to make use of the lounge since it opened in November, offering free access to its premier passengers. But Luxury Lounges Ltd., the design firm that created the space, hopes to open it up to more travelers for a fee — around $35 — in the near future.

Business   Scrub Up. Advertisement By Daniel Raymon Mar 6, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — Erno RUBIK, the Hungarian architect who is best known for inventing the Rubik’s Cube, once said that “the problems of puzzles are very near the problems of life.” So if your life doesn’t have enough problems already, take a crack at Daniel Raymon’s rebus, which will help you meet your quota. I will resist the urge to say too much about the rebus, but I’ll just say that the easiest point of entry is at 19 Across if you remember that “Cajun French” is a DIALECT. The puzzle holds up in the non-theme answer department, too. There are several entries that include the letters J and K, which can be tough to place in a crossword. Just to pick a few as examples, there’s JAMBS and JINX, and KABOB and KARAT. Daniel’s notes are below. But beware, as there are spoilers. This is my first Thursday puzzle so I’m very excited for everyone to see it. It’s especially exciting to have my very own creation join the group of NYT rebus puzzles. On that note, there have been other rebus puzzles using “box” phrases as revealers, just like this one. One thing that makes mine a little different, I think, is that each rebus box is a different word. I also like how I was able to split up both ZEST and TONE in two different ways; not so for LAVA and DIAL, but at least there’s some symmetry there — two split up differently, two not. I also like the long answers for the most part, though PASADENA, BRUSSELS and BRATIS[LAVA] might be a bit too much geography for one puzzle. Also RA[DIAL] TIRE and PIS[TON E]NGINE are a bit bland, especially for theme answers. Oh well. Overall I’m very happy with the puzzle, and I hope you enjoy it too! For today’s video, a classic by OTIS Redding. How did you fare? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.

Fashion   Saint Laurent’s Teen Spirit. Advertisement Advertisement By SUZY MENKESMARCH 4, 2014 PARIS — At Saint Laurent, the designer Hedi Slimane became one of the first to drag fashion across the screen and take it downtown. Even when the clothes in his winter 2009 show were tailored and smartened up, the models acted like young women with a “don’t care” attitude. Mr. Slimane stood backstage this week alongside one such woman: Clementine Creevy, 17, whose song “Teenage Girl,” originally sent to Rookie magazine, went viral. Expect the same for the sweet notes of “Had Ten Dollarz,” recorded especially for the Saint Laurent show in Paris on Monday. If these young women with mascara-drenched eyes had $10 or, realistically, 100 times more, they would surely buy every one of Saint Laurent’s new pieces right off the runway, including the tailored coats stopping precisely where a short skirt, often twinkling with sequins, draws a line across the pantyhose that runs down to a pair of glittering Mary Janes. The short skirts, sweaters with Aran detail and the ever-present tailoring were all wearable, although not inventive other than in presentation. There is something mesmerizing about Mr. Slimane’s Saint Laurent shows. As ever, the set was simple but hyper-sophisticated, with hydraulic metal bars folding down and then swinging up to create a long catwalk. It no doubt represented a road in Los Angeles, where friends were gathered, each reeking of sexuality from behind a black bow on a white satin collar or from the rounded capes, cut off just at that point on the thighs where a plaid kilt, scattered with sparkles, stopped. These young women did not look as if they were having as much fun as two of the front-row guests, Alex Turner and Miles Kane, the British musicians behind the group The Last Shadow Puppets who were swigging down a bottle of champagne. But there was something charming about the clothes, their proportions and the way the glitter came like puddles on asphalt to lighten the taut tailoring. The droopy cardigans of Mr. Slimane’s earlier collections had been swept away and sweet flower patterns mostly extinguished. There were still frissons of bad girls, as seen in a dress printed with guns that also appeared in some of the pictures produced from the ashes of paintings that the Los Angeles artist John Baldessari had burned. Mr. Slimane said backstage that Mr. Baldessari had been the show’s first inspiration. A thematic visual diary of Paris Fashion Week inspired by the essential building blocks of fashion and style. “The project I did with John gave me the idea of proportion,” said the designer, whose short hemlines under the rounded capes created the memory stick of the show. “I started with three dresses, then the cape was a logic of evolution.” Is it right for a designer to present clothes that seem to be reincarnations of what is already on the teen scene? With each collection, the Saint Laurent of Mr. Slimane seems increasingly convincing, a reinterpretation of the iconic designer of the early 1970s. (Significantly, the designer and that period are the subject of two current French films.) Advertisement The rejuvenated Saint Laurent girl has arrived in fashion. Or, as the Clementine Creevy lyrics go, “I know that she knows that it’s my way.” Go to Home Page »

Science   Music Born of Magical Thinking. Advertisement   It can’t be funny, I told myself. The tunes might be fabulous — after all, Ms. Brooke won critics’ praise for setting Woody Guthrie’s journal entries to music. But oh, those monologues about her mother would be unbearable. How much better to stay home and cry over doomed romance than inexorable death. But off I went to the Duke Theater on 42nd Street for a performance both funny and wrenching, one I suspect would resonate with caregivers everywhere. I met Ms. Brooke later for a conversation about her mother and the events described on stage. Lanky in the jeans and flannel shirt she wears during performances, her long hair tied loosely back, she could have been any of us with little time for glamour. Among the more than 15 million Americans providing unpaid care for family and friends with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, at least three – Ms. Brooke, 50; her manager/director/husband, Patrick Rains, 64; and his sister, Julie, 60, underemployed and “couch surfing” – managed to find endless humor in a family crisis that unfolded from 2010 to 2012, as Ms. Brooke’s mother descended deeper into Alzheimer’s. Ms. Brooke had a lifetime of practice dealing with her mother, whose florid wackiness and succession of illnesses, long before Alzheimer’s, would have sent most children running for the hills. Instead the two were linked, said Ms. Brooke, as if there were “an electrical current running between us.” She was one of three children — the youngest, the only girl and the lone skeptic in a devout family of Christian Scientists in Boston. The language of the religion, its lessons and allegiances, “never leave you once you’ve been indoctrinated,’’ Ms. Brooke said.  Those four noses, it turns out, are the collected prostheses her mother, Darren Stone Nelson, wore after untreated skin cancer had turned her into a “maxillofacial work of art,” as Ms. Brooke put it. The cure for what ailed her mother, in the Christian Science view, was Mary Baker Eddy’s unwavering belief that divine love “always will meet every human need.” The same was true when Mrs. Nelson had a uterine tumor. By comparison, her terrible arthritis seemed a mere inconvenience. “Mom was a magical thinker,” Ms. Brooke said. “So I was burdened with reality.” If the material world were an illusion, as she was taught, then so is sickness and death. Ms. Brooke took her first Advil at 30. She has attended just one funeral, her father-in-law’s. Perhaps it’s understandable that dementia didn’t occur to Ms. Brooke as an explanation for her mother’s increasingly erratic behavior until she was well down the road. This was a woman who found a rainbow wig in the town dump and wore it constantly when her daughter was an easily embarrassed seventh grader. It was the postman who hesitantly suggested that Mrs. Nelson didn’t belong alone at home anymore. An independent or assisted living facility seemed the solution, as it does to so many of us. Ms. Brooke quickly settled her mother into a home for aged Christian Scientists in Massachusetts. She visited, dined with her mother’s new friends, each with more grievously untreated maladies than the next. “Mental malpractice,’’ Ms. Brooke calls it now. Mrs. Nelson’s hygiene was wanting, a common Alzheimer’s symptom, and the staff let her get away with excuses rather than insisting she shower. “Now isn’t a good time,” she’d say. Or “I’m in the middle of something.” Ms. Brooke eventually realized that “hymns three times a week is not going to cut it.’’ Terrified and ignorant, but determined and mindful, she said, that “I’m my mother’s only daughter,’’ Ms. Brooke brought her to New York City. Home was, and remains, Apartment 7K in a rental building on upper (waaaaaaay upper) Fifth Avenue. Ms. Brooke rented an apartment on the third floor and moved her mother there. “I could see her window from my living room,’’ she said. Their first enormous challenge, as Ms. Brooke describes it in the play, was dealing with her mother’s painful, unrelenting constipation. Once, just ‘‘clipping her toenails creeped me out.’’ Now, it was suppositories and enemas — and “poetry in this terrible intimacy,’’ a transition many caregivers will recognize. Before long, Mrs. Nelson “became the crazy lady screaming down the hall.’’ The singer and songwriter sings the number “Time” from her show “My Mother Has 4 Noses,” at the Duke on 42nd Street. Hoping to relieve her mother’s excruciating arthritic pain, Ms. Brooke agreed to have her undergo a knee replacement. There was not a word of warning from doctors that this wasn’t a great idea for a woman too cognitively impaired for physical therapy. After surgery, Mrs. Nelson hallucinated for a week, Ms. Brooke recalled, and attempts at rehabilitation were like scenes from “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.’’ Within months of the ill-advised operation, a hospice team joined the crowd in Mrs. Nelson’s apartment. Still this hardy woman lingered, from hospice’s arrival in October until the next January. On a Saturday night, the nurses said her mother was “actively dying,’’ common end-of-life parlance but alien vocabulary to a Christian Scientist. Ms. Brooke longed for her brothers, “lovely, beautiful men.” But they were too steeped in their religion, she said, for a deathbed vigil. Mrs. Nelson’s caretakers read her Mary Baker Eddy’s version of the 23rd Psalm. They watched Christian Science church services online. “We really tried to speak the language, honor the lessons,’’ Ms. Brooke said, but religion seemed to have lost her power, and her mother seemed more enamored of Chanel No. 5, her favorite perfume, which her daughter sprayed in the air. Monday became Tuesday. Mrs. Nelson’s breathing was thready. When her time came, “she really did just slip away,” Ms. Brooke said. Waiting for the undertaker, Ms. Brooke, her husband and sister-in-law, and the caregivers sang sublime hymns and ridiculous ditties like “How Much Is That Doggie in the Window.’’ A man arrived with a black body bag, loaded it, disinfected his hands, rode down to the lobby and pushed the gurney down Fifth Avenue to his van. The gurney fit easily in the elevator, Ms. Brooke said, because long ago the apartment building had been a nursing home. That detail is not in the performance, but, Ms. Brooke said, “the irony isn’t lost on me.” Jane Gross is The New Old Age’s founding blogger and author of “A Bittersweet Season: Caring for Our Aging Parents — and Ourselves” (Alfred A.

Travel   New Trips for Cycling in the City. Advertisement If bicycling along the scenic countryside is getting a little ho-hum, Bicycle Adventures offers an alternative. The outfitter just began the Urban Adventure Series, four-day trips designed for the city lover — this year in Seattle; Portland and Bend, Ore.; and New York City. “You can see, hear and smell the city up close, and it’s so easy to stop, hop off and explore a shop or a cafe, have a conversation or admire art or city culture,” Todd Starnes, the owner of Bicycle Adventures, said in a release. The Seattle trip includes the urban and suburban Burke-Gilman Trail; the John Wayne Pioneer Trail, east of town; and of course the waterfront, including Pike Place Market. A ferry ride over to Bainbridge Island takes cyclists to Classic Cycle to check out its vintage bike museum. Portland riders will hit the Eastbank Esplanade path and the West Hills neighborhood for a skyline view, stopping along the way to smell the barley at Velocult, a bike shop, taproom, coffee house, and more. The Bend Breakaway visits microbreweries, boutiques and galleries in nearby Sisters, and features rides surrounded by snow-capped peaks. Guests also have the opportunity to bike to McKenzie Pass, one of central Oregon’s most spectacular scenic byways. The spring tour of New York City starts with an introduction to Manhattan, a ride around Central Park and a Broadway show, and ends on May 4 with the TD Five Boro Bike Tour, said to be the world’s biggest recreational bike ride, with about 32,000 participants. Riders pedal through all five boroughs on streets free of automobile traffic. Rates for the three West Coast trips are $1,984 per person, double, and the New York trip is $2,495 per person, which includes bikes, lodging and most meals.

Business   Japan Won’t Impose Banking Laws on Bitcoin. Advertisement TOKYO — Bitcoin trading platforms can, for now, operate freely under Japanese law, the government said Friday in a note that signaled a hands-off approach to the virtual currency. In fact, Bitcoin is not a currency at all and is not subject to Japan’s stringent banking laws, officials said in a six-page paper that highlighted uncertainties more than clarifying the issues surrounding the digital payment system. The paper did confirm that transactions using Bitcoin are not considered banking and that an exchange trading them does not need to obtain a banking license or to meet compliance standards that such a license would require.  But the status of Bitcoin also makes it off-limits for Japanese banks, seemingly leaving the handling of them up to unregulated operators like Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection last week after losing half a billion dollars’ worth of its customers’ Bitcoin. Like any other commodity, however, Bitcoin is subject to taxes in Japan, the paper said. It left unclear whether the simple purchase of Bitcoins would be subject to Japan’s 5 percent sales tax, which is set to rise to 8 percent in April. Toshinori Matsushio, an official at the National Tax Agency, said that Bitcoin purchases were likely to be slapped with the sales tax unless they were singled out for exemption, much as postage stamps are in Japan. It would also be virtually impossible for the government to levy taxes on peer-to-peer sales. In this regard, Japan’s regulatory approach seemed to differ from that taken by other countries. According to a statement this week by the UK Digital Currency Association, British revenue and customs officials are set to announce that virtual currencies should be treated almost identically to other currencies in terms of taxation. That would mean no sales tax would be levied on Bitcoin sales and transactions. Still, the paper stressed that discussions would continue on the details of how Bitcoin would be taxed, as well as the need for more regulation to better protect Bitcoin users. Japan “has not yet grasped a complete picture” of Bitcoin, the paper said, and various government agencies are still “collecting information.” Now that Bitcoin has been deemed beyond the limits of Japan’s financial regulator, basic oversight and the drafting of more detailed guidelines could be left to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry or the consumer protection agency. In a news conference, the top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said investigations of the Mt. Gox collapse could make it necessary for the government to review or revise its response. When asked to clarify how Bitcoin might be taxed, Mr. Suga gave no details. “Of course, the Finance Ministry would be thinking of various ways to tax it,” he said. The government prepared its note in response to questions submitted to Parliament by an opposition lawmaker, Tsutomu Okubo, a former managing director for Morgan Stanley. The cabinet approved the paper Friday morning. Colin Moreshead contributed reporting from Tokyo. Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   To Change India’s Preference for Sons, Start With the Women. Advertisement   I first visited India as a tourist in 1971 at the age of 27. I spent six months backpacking through the country and was surprised to find so many people everywhere, even in the remote countryside. Mothers were always surrounded by small children, only a year or so apart in age. Coming from a sparsely populated country like Canada where, even then, small families were the norm, I was intrigued by India’s rapidly growing population. What lay behind it, and why did Indian women have so many children? In 1974, I returned to study this question as a doctoral student at the University of Pune and selected the village of Gove in Satara District, Maharashtra, for my research. Most women said they wanted only three or four children, but they had an average of 5.6. The key determining factor was the number of sons they had — they would keep having children until a boy was born. I completed two follow-up studies in Gove in 1987 and 2008. In 2008, son preference was still evident: For every village girl aged 6 or younger, there were 1.4 boys. My new book, “Gender Equality and Inequality in Rural India: Blessed With a Son,” is based on those studies and explores the intersection of longstanding cultural norms, socioeconomic context and a rising India. In 2008, despite tremendous economic progress, gender inequality remained entrenched. Parents still had to give huge gifts (instead of dowry, now illegal) to get their daughters married. Girls typically signed away their land to brothers at the time of their marriage. Most young brides, even those with secondary and tertiary education, were confined to the household and experienced pressure from their mothers-in-law to have children as quickly as possible. For boys, education was considered a means of securing a good job; for girls, it was seen as a precursor to homemaking and motherhood. Although couples now wanted only one or two children, they still felt compelled to have sons. Gender bias affects the way women are viewed and treated in their communities, which on a larger scale deters them from contributing fully to the global economy. In 2008, only 7 percent of married Gove women worked in white-collar jobs like teaching and office work. Interestingly, these women made more use of modern contraceptives and delayed having their first children longer than unemployed women with the same amount of schooling. Moreover, these women were also significantly more willing to stop having children after only one or two, even if they did not have sons. Despite the persistence of son preference, my research identified promising areas for change in rural women’s position. In 1975 and 1987, families felt they needed more sons to provide for them and support them in old age. Correspondingly, girls were not given an opportunity to continue their studies beyond eight or nine years. I believed that providing girls an avenue to be on an equal footing with sons — through education — would be a first step toward reducing the gender bias. In 1987, I established a modest scholarship program, administered by village trustees, to fund the college education of one girl every year for up to four years. I knew this was breaking new ground: The trustees, in fact, tried to persuade me to focus on boys because they did not think any girl would apply. To their surprise, one girl did apply in the first year and became the first girl from Gove to independently commute by bus to the district capital of Satara, 14 kilometers, or about nine miles, away, participate in extracurricular activities and navigate life in the city. The next year, two girls applied, and from there, female college attendance grew, underscoring a recognition in the community that girls of any caste or economic class could pursue a higher education. Most of those awarded scholarships had mixed success in completing their studies, but their exposure to the outside world helped them face the future confidently. Several of them told me that they felt no need to have sons because girls could “stand on their own feet” and look out for their welfare, even after marriage. This was found to be true: In case studies with 30 widows, two said they had received financial support from their daughters during economic hardship. In addition to education and jobs, stricter enforcement of the Hindu Succession Act, which allows girls equal shares of family property, could increase gender equality. Indeed, more young men in 2008 expected their sisters to receive shares of family property than previously. As land becomes scarce, neither girls nor boys can anticipate inheriting large parcels of land, but daughters should be compensated equally for what they sign away. The government could also establish bank accounts for daughters with mandatory deposits equal to the value of land or other assets received by sons in any inheritance transactions. Such a policy would need to be carefully monitored to assure that daughters’ rights could not be alienated. A promising government pilot project designed to promote reproductive health and improve the sex ratio is what is known as the “honeymoon package,” initiated in Satara District in 2007. It provides monetary incentives for couples who postpone their first births two to three years, which in turn provides a window of time for women to work before having children. Couples who enroll in the program pledge to monitor the health of the woman and report any pregnancy, so that the selective abortion of female fetuses is less likely to occur. It is too early to assess whether the honeymoon package has been successful in reducing son preference, but 2011 census data does show an improvement in the sex ratio. Satara District, which previously had a lower female-to-male sex ratio than Maharashtra, reported 988 to 1,000 males in 2011, compared with 922 females to 1,000 males for the state as a whole. Progressive Indian couples have found ways to rejoice in having daughters, such as allowing girls to perform special rituals at the death of their parents, encouraging them to find rewarding jobs and refusing to give lavish wedding gifts to get them married. A few Gove families, in fact, refused gifts in exchange for marriage arrangements, and with the rising age of marriage, more families were allowing girls to work for a few years before their marriage. The potential of rural women’s modern employment offers tremendous advantages, not only for individual women, but also for India. According to Gallup surveys from 2009 to 2012, only 25 percent of Indian women were employed or seeking work in the labor force compared with 70 percent in China; whereas for men, the difference was negligible (83 percent in China, 80 percent in India). As my study shows, young married rural women are a huge untapped potential with much to contribute, both to India’s growth story and to the enhancement of gender equality. Dr. Vlassoff is a Canadian demographer and women’s health specialist with a long career in international development. Her book, “Gender Equality and Inequality in Rural India: Blessed With a Son,” will be released in India on March 10. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Home   Break It and No Allowance. Advertisement Advertisement On Location By SANDY KEENAN MARCH 5, 2014 In one corner of the room, playing on a thin glass screen dangling from the ceiling by wires, was a moody animated video from “The Last Clown” installation by the artist Francis Alys on a continuous loop: a solitary man making his way along a path in an anonymous park. Nearby, apparently in perpetual motion as well, an 8-year-old boy wielded a full-size hockey stick and a hard orange ball, weaving around the glass screen and other museum-caliber artworks, a practice allowed, and even encouraged, by the current management. If this were a piece of performance art, it might be titled something like “A Curator’s Nervous Breakdown.” But the setting was neither a gallery nor a museum. It was the home of Clay and Tom Tarica, avid art collectors who decided long ago to ignore the conventional wisdom that art and children don’t mix. The trick, it turns out, is that the crucial ingredient is a little extra space. Until 2007, the couple lived with babies, cribs and crates of art in a cramped one-bedroom apartment in Greenwich Village, where they often went years without seeing much of the extensive collection they had amassed. Advertisement That all changed after they bought a 1950s ranch house in Larchmont, N.Y., for $1.65 million and hired Andrew Berman, an architect in Manhattan, to reimagine it so that their family and their art collection could coexist happily. (The renovation, completed in 2009, cost about $1 million.) “They were very clear,” Mr. Berman said. “They wanted to live comfortably with their art and their children in a house that was very calm, very clean and unprepossessing — with nothing off-limits to the kids.” Mr. Tarica, 43, an executive at a shoe company that his grandparents founded in 1956 (his family no longer owns it), and Ms. Tarica, 40, who was an assistant at the Museum of Modern Art when they met, now have a five-bedroom, 3,400-square-foot home with plenty of room for their growing art collection and their growing family, which she oversees: Madeleine, 10; Will, 8; and Sam, who is nearly 3. During a recent weekend snowstorm, the children created a pillow fort by moving furniture and bedding into the living room, where they were surrounded with works by Olafur Eliasson, Tomma Abts, Carol Bove and Christopher Williams, among others. Madeline helped drag in all the dining room chairs, and Sam brought his blanket. The impromptu structure was meant to be a stadium for Will’s Stuffed Animal Football League, or S.A.F.L., a group currently dominated by a family of panda bears. But kids wouldn’t be kids if they didn’t push some boundaries, and at one point Will went back to practicing hockey, this time attempting to use the fireplace as the goal. “Are you kidding me,” Mr. Tarica said, barely raising his voice. “Please cut that out.” Over the course of their 12-year-marriage, the couple have developed a shared understanding of not just child rearing, but also art. Ms. Tarica tends to be slow and deliberate about her choices, she said, while her husband is more impetuous. Advertisement “In the end," she added, “we usually agree on everything — art, design, furniture — which is good.” They’re hoping their passion for art will eventually rub off on the children. In the meantime, it’s enough that nothing has been hurt or ruined. “Intuitively, they know how to keep their bodies away from the art,” Ms. Tarica said. And when the children’s friends come over for play dates, she said, Will takes it upon himself to issue a warning. “Just be careful around the art,” he tells them. “Some of it is really fragile.” A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2014, on page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Break It and No Allowance.

Politics   In PracticeTracking the Affordable Care Act. View All Posts » When the federal online marketplace for the Affordable Care Act stumbled out of the gate last fall, leaving would-be applicants unable to sign up for care or even to view their plans, three young programmers thought they might be able to help frustrated users. In October, they packaged reams of publicly-available data into a website, healthsherpa.com, that allowed users to immediately view exchange plans in their area. But the site was intended for research only; users still had to purchase them through the federal and state health exchanges or, in some cases, directly through insurers. That changed last week, when the programmers — Michael Wasser, George Kalogeropoulos and Ning Liang — added functionality to their website that allows people to actually sign up for plans on their site, and joined a group of so-called Web brokers who offer a way to enroll in qualified health plans that they say is quicker and simpler than using the federal exchange. “We’re hoping that we’re building an easier place to sign up for health insurance where you get the same exact results as you would on HealthCare.gov,” said Mr. Wasser. Mr. Wasser said the programmers were approached last fall, after they started their website, by Bryan Sivak, the chief technology officer for the Department of Health and Human Services. They made an agreement that would allow healthsherpa.com to integrate with elements of HealthCare.gov and sign individuals up for on-exchange plans, with subsidies. The HealthSherpa team has since added two more employees and raised $1.1 million in seed funding. Their business model is similar to that of an insurance broker, since they will earn commissions from insurance companies when the individuals who use their site to sign up for coverage pay their premiums. Mr. Wasser said it currently took users on the site about an hour to sign up for care. First, users enter their zip code to see a list of available plans in their area, which they can refine according to their age, family size and their preferred level of coverage. After selecting a plan, they are directed to a page on healthcare.gov, where they enter information to determine their eligibility for tax credits and cost-sharing reduction. Users are then directed back to healthsherpa.com to confirm and enroll. “We’re just working to try to find as many ways as we can to shorten the time it takes for people to sign up,” said Mr. Wasser, who said he and his team would eventually like to reduce sign-up time to as little as 10 minutes. So far, according to Mr. Wasser, several hundred people have started the application process on his website, and about 40 had completed the signup process — about a third of whom had applied for subsidies. The Department of Health and Human services has about 30 agreements with Web brokers intended to enable the sites to offer consumers options outside the federal exchange to sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act. “By strengthening the multiple channels to enroll in quality, affordable coverage through the Marketplace, we are offering Americans more options to purchase new coverage,” said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But the sites have offered varying levels of functionality, in part because of technical issues in determining users’ eligibility, which is still done through the federal system. “The reason we’re not seeing more web brokers doing this process online right now is because the eligibility system is still being fixed,” said Claire McAndrew, the private health insurance director of FamiliesUSA, a health care consumer advocacy group. GoHealth.com, for example, has been signing up users for exchange plans with subsidies using a call center since November. And last month, GetInsured.com announced the launch of a web-only enrollment process for plans under the Affordable Care Act — something the company had initially planned on offering sooner. As HealthSherpa does, it now directs customers to HealthCare.gov and then back to its own sites during the process. The website eHealth can sign people up for plans, but the company’s C.E.O., Gary Lauer, recently told CNBC it had been unable to process subsidies. The private exchanges say that their tools make it easier for users to see available plans, and that their sign-up process is quicker than the federal exchange. But consumer advocates warn that Web brokers’ presentation of insurance plan information may be influenced by their commission deals with those companies. “For some plans you’ll see the premiums, the benefits, the cost sharing — for other plans you’ll see a name. That can really influence which plan a consumer might pick,” said Ms. McAndrew, who added, “I always recommend that people go to the official marketplace website.”
Science   Allergies Are Everywhere Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement People hoping to find an allergy-free haven may be out of luck. A new study has found that no region of the United States is allergy-free, but the kind of allergy people are likely to suffer from varies by region, race and socioeconomic status. Researchers gave blood tests to 8,124 people, 856 of them children under 6, to detect immunoglobulin E antibodies, or IgEs. The presence of an IgE antibody that reacts to a specific substance increases the risk of having an allergy-related illness ike allergic asthma, hay fever or rash. The scientists tested people for antibodies to a range of potential allergens, including cats, dogs, milk, cockroaches, peanuts, grass, ragweed and shrimp. No matter where they lived, about 45 percent of people over 6 had positive tests for at least one allergen, and so did 36 percent of the children 1 to 5 years old. “To me, the biggest surprise is that the level of sensitivities didn’t differ region to region,” said the senior author, Dr. Darryl C. Zeldin, a scientific director at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. “This goes completely against what most people would have said. The bottom line is that sensitization patterns differ by region, but overall sensitization rates are high.” Grass and ragweed sensitivities were higher in the West, mold allergy more common in the East. Positive tests for indoor allergens were higher in the East than the West, but there were almost no regional differences for peanut, shrimp, egg, dog, cat, rat and mouse sensitivities. The most common positive tests among the adult group were for dust mites, grass and ragweed, with almost 20 percent of the population showing sensitivity to each. About 12 percent of people over 6 were sensitive to dogs or cats, and among the youngest children, milk and eggs were the most common positive tests. Inhalant allergies like ragweed and grass peaked in the teens and 20s, then decreased later in life. Race and socioeconomic status also made a difference. Non-Hispanic blacks had the highest sensitivity to all tested allergens except Russian thistle and egg. Sensitivity to cockroaches and shrimp were associated with lower economic status, and dog and cat allergies were more common in higher income groups. In large metropolitan areas, 50 percent of the population was sensitized to at least one allergen, but only 40 percent in rural areas. Outdoor allergens like grass and ragweed affected 37.8 percent of the urban population, but less than a quarter of people in nonmetropolitan areas, possibly because respiratory allergies are associated with air pollution. The study, published online in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, also found that allergies cluster in groups: people sensitive to dust mites are also likely to be sensitive to grass and tree pollen; sensitivity to peanuts, usually considered a food allergy, tends to cluster with plant allergies; cockroach and shrimp sensitivity are a common pair, probably because they contain a similar allergen, a protein called tropomyosin. Ganesa Wegienka, an epidemiologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit who was not involved in the research, said that the paper provided “a nice snapshot of what’s going on in the U.S.,” and she was especially impressed with the data on clusters of sensitivities. “This has implications for doctors and patients,” she said. “If a child is sensitized to one allergen in a cluster of allergens, maybe the doctor should be looking at other allergens in the cluster to think about treatment plans.” Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Travel   Trips from Outside Magazine. Advertisement Outside magazine has long taken readers on armchair trips. Now the monthly, which covers adventure, has linked up with travel outfitter Uncharted Outposts to create a new travel company called Outside Go. “The new brand is really creating one-of-a-kind experiences,” said Outside Go’s president, Sandy Cunningham, mentioning safaris by mountain bike or multisport trips in Turkey and Greece. “If offers the opportunity to inspire people to live a more active life in whatever destination they visit.” Outside Go will offer three kinds of services, including scheduled group trips, independent trips and custom-designed itineraries. Another nine trips will be announced in the next several weeks, but the company has already begun selling a six-day surfing trip to Nicaragua departing March 22 ($2,795 per person, double occupancy). Of 15 independent trips, called Go Anytime, only one is currently available, a six-day, lodge-based trip in Alaska with daily outings by bush plane to visit glaciers, remote rivers and lakes and Pacific shores with options to hike, ice climb, fish or raft depending on the day’s itinerary. The trip, available June 1 through September, starts at $7,995 per person, double occupancy. The outfitter says it can handle all kinds of requests, including tracking pumas in Chile, planning alpine ascents and guiding trout fishing trips on remote North American rivers. So far, Mount Everest is not in the plans. “It’s not about super uber danger for us,” Ms. Cunningham said. “We’re not looking at doing the craziest adventure, but if people want to kite board in Morocco or Nicaragua, we will make it happen.” In Transit is a blog on travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.

Business   Havana Highball. Advertisement By David Steinberg Mar 8, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — I’m going to open today’s discussion with a couple of questions: Why is it so hard to get restaurants in countries that are not the United States to put an ice cube in a drinking glass? Also, how is it that these same countries, with their high standards of education, do not understand the singular concept of “Diet Coke”? I bring this up because today’s puzzle by David “I Don’t Even Have My Driver’s License Yet” Steinberg has the entry COKE ZERO at 12 Down, and in my recent South African and less recent European travels, I noticed two crucial cultural differences that might just erode any chances we have for world peace. I’m positive that this has come up at Camp David at least once. First, other countries apparently like to drink their carbonated beverages lukewarm and ice-free, even if the temperature outside is so hot that one’s underarm areas could legally be declared flood zones. Requests for ice in one’s glass are met with a quizzical, somewhat pitying look that says “Really? You want your beverage cold? And you used to think of yourself as a superpower.” Second, in the United States we have two basic, utilitarian Coca-Colas: Coke and Diet Coke. One has sugar and the other does not. It’s a simple concept, and it works for us. Outside of the United States, however, ordering the right sugar-free beverage becomes a little more complicated. They have Coke (contains sugar), Coke Light (does not contain sugar), COKE ZERO (does not contain sugar), and Another Sugar-Free Coke That Is So Light It Levitates (O.K., I made that one up. But you get the idea.) Does anyone else see the problem here? How are you supposed to know which beverage to order so you can complain that there is no ice in your glass? Of course, I am now back in the United States and, according to the rules of international law, I am entitled to have as much ice as I want in my beverages, which is great, because now my core body temperature has cooled off enough to enjoy Mr. Steinberg’s puzzle [We were wondering when you were going to get to the point. –Ed.] As you’ll read below, Mr. Steinberg’s seed entries were JAILBREAK and CANDY SHOP in the northwest and GOOGLEBOT and SEXY SADIE in the southeast, which, coincidentally, were also my own favorite entries. I also liked JUST DO IT, CLARITIN, the shout out to the much-missed Gilda RADNER, and yes, even COKE ZERO, as long as it is served over ice. Let’s chat with Mr. Steinberg: In September 2012, I noticed that I had a lot of nine-letter seed entries lying around, so I decided to throw some of them together into a high-word-count, themeless grid. I was particularly happy that JAILBREAK and CANDY SHOP fit into the upper left corner and that GOOGLEBOT and SEXY SADIE fit into the lower right. In the other two corners, I especially liked COKE ZERO, CLARITIN, JUST DO IT, and MOJITO. ARIOSI, AIOLIS, and LLDS weren’t (and still aren’t) my favorites, though I was pleased with how the fill turned out overall, so I wrote up the clues and submitted the puzzle to Will. Will liked the puzzle but had concerns about BIG HOAX sounding a bit contrived; luckily, though, he decided to let it stand. When I first saw the edited version of this crossword, I couldn’t tell which one of my puzzles it was, since Will’s brilliant “Cooler idea?” and “One stocking bars” clues completely eluded me! I had clued JAILBREAK in the sense of jailbreaking a phone [To jailbreak a phone means to hack into its operating system to maintain greater control over what you download –D.A.] and CANDY SHOP as the 50 Cent song, so it took me an embarrassingly long time to identify the puzzle, because Will’s clues for these entries were completely different. Enjoy my puzzle, and I look forward to seeing some of you at the A.C.P.T. (perhaps even solving this crossword!) Finally, many thanks for the TaD (Tall and Dapper) Tom Gaffney for holding down the fort.

Foreign   Building Bridges Between the Military and Universities. Advertisement   The president of Columbia, Lee C. Bollinger, stood beside retired Rear Adm. James Lowe, class of 1951, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Juan Garcia III in a ceremony that, according to Mr. Bollinger, ofﬁcially “healed the breech” between the university and the military that developed during the Vietnam War and continued until the university senate voted in April 2011 to allow the Naval ROTC program’s return. But only 50 blocks downtown, at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York, an attempt to integrate the military with academia has been met with heated resistance. David Petraeus, the retired general hired as an adjunct instructor last year, faced a small but vitriolic group of students who confronted him in the street on the way to his first class. They called him a “war criminal” and protested his appointment to the university. The group has since organized and gained support from other students and faculty under the name the “Ad Hoc Committee Against the Militarization of CUNY.” The markedly different scenes, which played out late last year, exemplify the tension between American universities and the military, particularly during a time of transition for the armed forces. As the military downsizes and returns to pre-war force levels or below, many of those leaving the service will take advantage of the post-9/11 GI Bill to obtain a university education. At the same time, senior military leaders of the last decade are seeking post-retirement opportunities, with some turning to universities to take positions as lecturers. Historically, the relationship between universities and the military has been complicated, though it wasn’t always so tense. During both World Wars, universities commissioned thousands of new ofﬁcers to serve in all branches of the armed forces. At the forefront of this effort was, perhaps surprisingly, the Ivy League. In World War II, Cornell University commissioned 4,598 ofﬁcers, more than any other institution in the country, including the United States Military Academy at West Point. Each of the other Ivy League schools contributed as well, including hosting the largest Naval training program in the nation (Dartmouth), filling up the most positions in the Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (Yale), or conducting the ﬁrst research on atomic ﬁssion for The Manhattan Project (Columbia). But public opposition to the war in Vietnam brought a wave of anti-military sentiment that never subsided within traditionally liberal universities. Under increased pressure from anti-war activists on college campuses, as well as stricter academic conditions imposed by university administrations, the military terminated 88 ROTC programs across the country in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including in ﬁve of the eight Ivy League schools. By the early 1990s, academia’s disapproval of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy created a new barrier to military presence at universities until it was repealed in 2011. In effect, for whatever reason they had at a given time, many of the nation’s elite schools closed their doors to the military as a national institution and kept them locked for more than 40 years. In their book, Arms and the University, scholars Donald Downs and Ilia Murtazashvili present rational arguments for why an increased military presence on university campuses beneﬁts both sides, particularly in the form of ROTC programs. But universities since Vietnam have pushed back, and although, the authors write, they “pride themselves on being liberally minded and open to challenging ideas, this pride seems less merited when it comes to the military, even though the military is one of the most important institutions in American society.” The case of CUNY and General Petraeus comes at a time when American society has broad respect for the military, but a limited understanding. Other retired high-proﬁle ofﬁcers have taken positions as university lecturers without incident, including Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal at Yale, Adm. Mike Mullen at Princeton, Adm. Eric T. Olson at Columbia and Gen. James Mattis at Dartmouth. A handful of others are full professors, such as retired colonels Peter Mansoor at Ohio State and Andrew Bacevich at Boston University. The notion that the presence of General Petraeus and other former ofﬁcers is somehow an attempt by “the U.S. government and the CUNY administration to turn the university into an infamous ‘war college,’ ” as the student group’s ofﬁcial statement declared, seems overstated. If anything, exposure to the military through faculty, student veterans and ROTC programs is the best way for universities to play a part in bridging the civilian-military divide. Shutting the military out of these institutions only creates a separate class of citizens who volunteer to serve their country but have limited interaction with the very people they are charged with defending. To their credit, the CUNY administration upheld the university tradition of the “reasoned expression of dissent” despite pressure to do otherwise. The interim chancellor, William P. Kelly, released a statement in support of General Petraeus’s appointment, citing that “foreclosing the right of a faculty member to teach and the opportunity of students to learn is antithetical to that tradition, corrosive of the values at the heart of the academic enterprise. We defend free speech and we reject the disruption of the free exchange of ideas.” Back at Columbia, after the ofﬁcial ROTC ceremony ended, a group of civilians, veterans and service members mingled on the veranda to the background music of a Navy jazz ensemble. A few of the new midshipmen, several of whom are in their ﬁrst semester of college, had to leave the reception early to get to their next class. As they crossed under the bridge near 118th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, a few students walking in the opposite direction stopped to take a longer look at their fellow classmates wearing white Navy dress uniforms. They stared curiously, and then continued walking. Maybe next time they’ll say hello. David Eisler is the program manager for Words After War, a literary nonprofit based in New York City.

Science   Geriatricians Question Five Common Treatments. Advertisement It tells you something about American health care that scores of medical societies have joined a major campaign aimed at telling patients and doctors what not to do. That’s not exactly the language the Choosing Wisely initiative uses, admittedly. It has recruited more than 60 groups, representing specialties from dermatology to thoracic surgery, to come up with lists delicately called “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question.” “Question” sounds better than “flee,” doesn’t it? And it allows for individual differences in a way that a campaign called “Danger: Unacceptable Side Effects Ahead,” or “Watch Out: Useless Procedures,” might not. Still, Choosing Wisely wants to help us select drugs and tests and procedures that are backed by evidence, that don’t duplicate other treatments, that are “truly necessary” and won’t hurt us. Since 2012, its lists have included hundreds of drugs, tests and practices that fail to meet those standards, with more to come. Point made. We reported the American Geriatrics Society’s first “Five Things” list last year. The society has just published its second list, so I again turned to Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, and a member of the panel that developed both lists, to help explain what else older adults should be dodg — um, questioning. (You can see all 10 items here.) Topping this year’s list is a caution against dementia drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors — Aricept is the most widely used — without following up to see whether they’re really helping. Dementia is so feared, and the eventual prognosis so grim, that doctors and patients want to do something, anything, to stop its progress.  But while the drug may produce cognitive improvement that is statistically significant in a clinical trial, “it’s not clear that it’s big enough for a caregiver to even notice, or big enough to make a difference in a patient’s quality of life,” Dr. Lee said. “We’re learning, after more experience with these drugs, that they benefit a minority of patients.” On the other side of the equation, most patients who take them will experience gastrointestinal problems like nausea, cramping and diarrhea that often cause weight loss. So the society urges extensive discussion before doctors prescribe cholinesterase inhibitors and suggests no more than a three-month trial. If there’s no meaningful improvement by then, there won’t be later. “This is not a medication to start and then forget about,” Dr. Lee cautioned. Grouped second on the list are several tests we’ve often written about: mammograms for breast cancer, colon cancer screenings and P.S.A. tests for prostate cancer. Older people who are already frail or coping with several chronic diseases, and have life expectancies of less than 10 years, are not likely to benefit from finding such cancers — but they will face the short-term risks of complications and overtreatment from screening. “It may not make sense to expose them to these harms,” Dr. Lee said. Next to avoid: appetite stimulants in cases of weight loss, including high-calorie supplements like Boost and Ensure, or prescription drugs like megestrol acetate (brand name Megace) or the antidepressant Remeron. “The evidence that they actually improve outcomes is very, very thin,” Dr. Lee said. For the few patients who have trouble swallowing because they have head and neck cancer or esophageal cancer, these drugs or supplements may make sense. But in general, they may add a couple of pounds without improving survival or quality of life, because they don’t address the underlying reasons for weight loss. “Sometimes, families think patients are dying because they’re losing weight,” Dr. Lee said. “I tell them, they’re losing weight because they’re dying of something else.” There’s no evidence that adding calories, increasing fat but not muscle mass, will help them recover. And the drugs have side effects; the hormone-based Megace increases the risk of blood clots, for instance. The geriatrics society’s list also warns doctors not to prescribe new medications without reviewing the drugs that older patients are already taking, since so many can interact in harmful ways. “In a busy practice, it’s hard to look at everything someone is on, every time you prescribe a new drug,” Dr. Lee acknowledged. Older adults can be taking a dozen drugs daily. But at the least, the panel said, doctors should review all medications annually. Finally, the list concludes by cautioning against the use of restraints — tying down hands or legs, using vests or mitts, keeping people in beds with rails or in reclining chairs they can’t climb out of. Federal regulations already largely prohibit restraints in nursing homes, but they’re still widely used in hospitals, especially in intensive care units, where older patients frequently develop delirium. But when agitated patients are in restraints, “they generally get more agitated,” Dr. Lee said. And when forced to remain in bed, “they can lose strength and muscle mass very quickly. Instead of restraints, we should be thinking about keeping them as active as possible.” Family members or “sitters” who can help them walk safely would help, along with tested anti-delirium strategies. You can read fuller explanations of the list in the current issue of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Overall, Dr. Lee said, these aren’t things that should never happen. “They’re things that may be appropriate rarely but are being done frequently,” he said, “things that are commonplace and should be much, much less common.” Paula Span is the author of “When the Time Comes: Families With Aging Parents Share Their Struggles and Solutions.” The blog is ending, but our coverage of caregiving and aging is not.

Travel   A London Hotel Has a Focus on Sustainability. Advertisement According to London’s Draycott Hotel, encouraging guests to just reuse towels doesn’t cut it anymore when it comes to being eco-friendly. Its new “Keen to be Green” initiative is part of an effort to become the most sustainable boutique hotel in the city, including finding creative ways for travelers to reduce their carbon footprint. As part of this program, guests receive a curated map that details a CO2-emissions-free way to explore London, with suggested walking and biking routes as well as ideas for a green day out. The 35-room red brick Edwardian hotel also provides elegant recycling bins; a room service menu with English fare prepared from locally sourced ingredients like Scottish salmon and Welsh honey; and paraben-free toiletries from Penhaligon’s. Over the past four years, the hotel has also gradually replaced fluorescent lights with LED bulbs, and has favored electric over gas in the kitchen. Although it does not provide bike rentals, a Barclays-sponsored bike docking station is close to the hotel. The hotel uses recycled paper and provides ice only upon request in order to eliminate the energy consumed by idle ice machines, the general manager Melissa Stoman said in an interview. Staff members are also encouraged to bike to work whenever possible. The Cavendish was London’s first central hotel to merit the city’s gold “Green Tourism” award, which measures more than 150 indicators of sustainable practices ; the Draycott received the award in January 2013. The hotel does not, however, function on solar-powered energy. “With the gray weather in London, that would be rather difficult,” Ms. Stoman said. Rates start at £190 , about $327, for single occupancy (and include complimentary afternoon tea).

In the declaration, the 27 countries, including Britain, France, Turkey and the United States, called on the Egyptian government to be held accountable for its actions. “We express concern about the restrictions on the rights to peaceful assembly, expression and association, and about the disproportionate use of lethal force by security forces against demonstrators which resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries,” the declaration said.

Travel   A Finger Lakes Women’s History Focus. Advertisement It’s the wineries of New York’s Finger Lakes that usually get the most attention from tourists, but a trail of restored homes, parks and museums may have visitors picking up a bit of women’s history with their cabernet franc. At the heart of the trail — and the early women’s reform movement — is Seneca Falls, N.Y., and the 19th-century home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who organized the first women’s rights convention at the Wesleyan Chapel there in 1848. The chapel, Stanton’s house and other notable landmarks there and in nearby Waterloo now make up a Women’s Rights National Historical Park, which offers self-guided and ranger-led tours through the area. In March, Women’s History Month, the park’s programming is abundant with lectures, films and other events focused on how both 19th-century and modern-day activists have worked to achieve equality. In Rochester, N.Y., the trail leads to the former home of Susan B. Anthony, which served as a base for the National American Woman Suffrage Association, of which she was a president. A series of expansions and restorations has resulted in an ever-growing museum and research center. In Auburn, the Harriet Tubman Home is a stop that would surely have been approved by the foremothers, considering that most were also active abolitionists. This month, the Seward House Historic Museum down the street, home of Tubman’s friends and allies William and Frances Seward, will host a series of special programs. The National Park Service plans to introduce an official “Votes for Women History Trail” in early 2015.

Business   China’s Tencent to Buy Stake in JD.com as Part of E-Commerce Push. Advertisement   Today, one of the biggest rivalries in the tech world is playing out in China, where Alibaba and Tencent are locked in a battle for dominance in the world’s biggest market of Internet users. Alibaba, founded by the billionaire Jack Ma, is an e-commerce behemoth: the equivalent of Amazon and eBay rolled into one. Tencent, founded by the billionaire Pony Ma (no relation to Jack) is China’s champion of social messaging and online games, a dynamo of the mobile world. Lately, each company has been eyeing the other’s turf, relying on a strategy that boils down to buying into your competitor’s competitor. The latest example of this came on Monday, when Tencent, whose own e-commerce business is an also-ran in China, announced a deal to pay $215 million for a 15 percent stake in JD.com, the country’s No. 2 e-commerce company, behind Alibaba. Tencent’s latest encroachment into Alibaba’s business calls for it to buy an additional 5 percent stake in JD.com after JD.Com’s planned $1.5 billion listing on the Nasdaq is completed, and for the two companies to cooperate in China’s fast-growing e-commerce business. For Tencent and Alibaba, ‘‘the trenches are being dug in across the various parts of the territories that they occupy,’’ said Duncan Clark, the chairman of BDA, an investment advisory firm based in Beijing that is focused on the digital and consumer sectors. ‘‘Obviously, a weak point for Tencent versus Alibaba has been e-commerce,’’ he said. ‘‘And similarly, mobile for Alibaba is an area they are trying to address versus Tencent. The battle lines are becoming increasingly well- defined.’’ Alibaba, for its part, is expected to seek a listing this year in a deal that would be many times as large as JD.com’s. Analysts expect it to eclipse Facebook’s $16 billion initial public offering in 2012. JD.com, formerly known as 360buy.com, is a distant second in the Chinese e-commerce market to Alibaba’s shopping sites, Taobao.com and Tmall.com. By joining forces, Tencent and JD.com are seeking to challenge Alibaba, which handles the bulk of online purchases made by China’s rising consumer class. JD.com, whose I.P.O. is expected to be one of the biggest Chinese listings of the year in the United States, will seek to increase its sales by tapping into Tencent’s strong position in social networking. Tencent, with a market value of about $150 billion, operates Weixin, or WeChat, a popular messaging service similar to WhatsApp that has more than 200 million active monthly users. Analysts said that while Alibaba is the clear leader in e-commerce in China, there are areas in which JD.com has proved to be a tough competitor, particularly in sales of large appliances and consumer electronics. As part of the cooperation, JD.com will absorb several of Tencent’s unprofitable e-commerce businesses. E-commerce accounted for about 15 percent of Tencent’s 14.4 billion renminbi, or $2.3 billion, in revenue in the third quarter of last year, the most recent data available. In an announcement to the Hong Kong stock exchange, Tencent said the tie-up with JD.com would help to ‘‘extend the company’s presence in the fast- growing physical goods e-commerce market and to achieve economies of scale.’’ Under the terms of the deal, Tencent’s president, Martin Lau, will get a seat on JD.com’s board of directors, and Tencent is restricted from selling its stake for three years. The partnership, which will also include the online payment business, is for an initial term of five years. Alibaba, for its part, has been branching into Tencent’s core business of social media. It struck a $586 million deal last April for an 18 percent stake in Weibo, the Sina Corporation’s popular microblog service. Alibaba has also been reinforcing its strengths in e-commerce, agreeing in December to invest about $360 million in the Haier Group, one of China’s biggest manufacturers and distributors of household appliances, and to form a joint-venture logistics business with Haier. JD.com also has a substantial logistics network in China. The online retailer has 36 million active customer accounts and operates 82 warehouses in 34 cities, according to a filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and analysts say it stacks up well against its competitors in terms of the speed with which it processes orders and makes deliveries. JD.com’s earlier backers include the American hedge fund Tiger Global Management; the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner’s DST Global; Sequoia Capital, a California venture capital firm; and the Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and China Renaissance acted as financial advisers to JD.com on the deal, while Tencent was advised by Barclays. Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   China Warns of Risks in Plan to Retire Windows XP. Advertisement Microsoft’s plans to retire its Windows XP operating system have raised concerns in China, which has been slow to upgrade its computers. Microsoft says it will no longer be offering technical support or security patches for Windows XP after April 8, and it is encouraging users to upgrade to newer operating systems, such as Windows 8. Although the percentage of computers running Windows XP in China is declining ahead of Microsoft’s deadline, it’s still quite high. As of January, 49 percent of Chinese computers were using the 12-year-old operating system, according to StatCounter, an analysis firm. That compares with less than 18 percent worldwide and less than 11 percent in the United States.  Experts say the pervasiveness of software piracy in China, though it has tapered off in recent years, means that computer users are unenthusiastic about shelling out for upgrades. In China, the official retail price for Windows 8 is 988 renminbi, or about $160, for the basic version and 1,988 renminbi, or about $325, for the professional version, though discounted prices are widely available. China’s efforts nearly a decade ago to promote the use of legitimate software were a boon to the fortunes of Microsoft, which had struggled with widespread copying of its products. The government took steps to ensure that its own computers were not using pirated software and introduced rules that new machines had to have pre-installed, licensed operating systems. Beijing argues that Microsoft’s push to wean users off Windows XP and onto newer operating systems could harm its antipiracy efforts. In December, Yan Xiaohong, the deputy director of the National Copyright Administration, told a representative of BSA: The Software Alliance, an industry trade group, that Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows XP meant that Chinese consumers were facing grave security risks and that efforts to reduce software piracy would be undermined, because users would balk at the cost of upgrading their operating systems, according to a report in Legal Daily, a newspaper run by the Chinese Ministry of Justice. But those costs are part of the reason why Microsoft is unlikely to back down on its plan to phase out Windows XP. Erwin Visser, senior director within Microsoft’s Windows division, said last year that moving users off Windows XP was a $32 billion service opportunity for its commercial partners, ZDNet reported. The pressure for Chinese users to upgrade their systems has also revived longstanding concerns within China about United States government agencies using hidden security flaws in software developed by American companies for surveillance purposes. Ni Guangnan, a computer scientist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that Windows 8 would leave users open to security threats and urged Chinese government agencies and important industries not to adopt it because of the risk of American intrusions, according to Global Times, a newspaper run by the Communist Party-owned People’s Daily Group. Microsoft allows China and other countries to examine its source code and offer their own substitutions to ease concerns about vulnerabilities. Chinese technology firms say they plan to help users with some of the difficulties they will face with the changeover. Tencent, Kingsoft, Sogou and others will provide technical assistance with security problems and operating system upgrades, services they expect could be needed for the next two or three years, the state news agency Xinhua reported. “The upcoming shutdown will seriously affect Chinese users,” Ding Ke, a senior manager of Tencent, a major Chinese Internet portal, told Xinhua. Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world. Drawing on timely, engaging dispatches from The Times’ distinguished team of China correspondents, this blog brings readers into the debates and discussions taking place inside a fast-changing country and details the cultural, economic and political developments shaping the lives of 1.3 billion people.

Science   Every Dog Has Its Data Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Dropcam is like a nanny cam for your dog. With it, it’s easy to communicate with your pet remotely — but obedience is not included. Personal technology for health and fitness. A half-century ago, dogs lived in barns or backyards, domiciled in shabby little doghouses. Now they have the run of our houses and apartments. They sleep in our beds (full disclosure). In some cases, they are considered by their owners to be like children, and possibly a bit cleaner. So it is not so strange that the connected technologies that are creeping into the lives of humans are doing the same for pets. Wearable pet activity trackers keep tabs on Bella’s or Bear’s exercise. Some go further, monitoring dogs’ heart and respiratory rates and tracking locations in case they escape their homes. Webcams allow people who are away from home to monitor, communicate and play games with their pets, breaking up the monotony of lonely days. What’s making all these devices possible is an abundance of increasingly inexpensive miniature components created for the smartphone business: wireless chips, motion sensors and high-resolution camera lenses that can be jammed into pet-friendly devices. Smartphone apps, meanwhile, are giving people a way to visualize the biometric data these devices collect and to snoop on pet behavior from anywhere with a wireless connection. These device manufacturers are chasing the growing pile of money people are lavishing on animals. Total annual spending on pets in this country, including food, veterinary care and medicine, more than tripled over the past two decades to $55.5 billion last year, according to the American Pet Products Association. The tighter bond between household animals and the people formerly known as owners has established pet wellness as a serious business, and tech firms are taking note. “It is the idea of being able to interact with your pet in a more meaningful way,” said Con Slobodchikoff, an emeritus professor of biology at Northern Arizona University. “Right now, pretty much all people have is voice to interact with their pets or touch. People want more.” Heidi Hurn recently clipped one of these gadgets, the Whistle Activity Monitor, to the collar of Hoosier, her 11-year-old chocolate Labrador retriever. This $130 brushed metal device, about the dimensions of a ketchup bottle cap, records when he is active, for how long and at what intensity level.  It is the canine equivalent of the Jawbone UP, a fitness tracker that Ms. Hurn bought for her fiancé. Through an app on her iPhone, Ms. Hurn, 32, who works in medical device sales in Seattle, can see a bar chart showing how hard and for how long her dog walker is exercising Hoosier. She can see how active he is when she and her fiancé are not at home. (Revealed: Hoosier is sacked out from five minutes after they leave until the moment they get home.) Ms. Hurn said she and her fiancé got the device because Hoosier’s veterinarian emphasized that keeping him active is likely to extend his life. She said the detailed logs of his exercise make the couple feel more responsible. “We are very attentive parents,” she said. “He’s our only child.” I, too, recently put a Whistle on the collar of Mitzi, my 5-year-old pit bull/Labrador retriever mix. After a few days, I was able to compare her activity level to other mixed-breed dogs. I felt small glow of pride when the Whistle app sent me a congratulatory text after Mitzi surpassed her daily exercise goal four days in a row. More wearable tech for pets is on the way.  Already on sale is a collar device called Tagg that combines activity monitoring with location tracking to help recover lost pets. Voyce, an activity tracker available later this year, also monitors a dog’s heart and respiratory rates. “We really see ourselves as the wellness coach for the life of the dog,” said Jeff Noce, president of i4C Innovations, the maker of Voyce. It’s possible the data from these devices could eventually help medical researchers better understand pet ailments. According to a 2012 study commissioned by the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, more than 52 percent of dogs and more than 58 percent of cats are overweight or obese, conditions which can lead to diabetes and worsen arthritis. A 14-year study commissioned by Purina, the pet food company, found that a dog’s median life span can be extended by 15 percent by restricting the diet to maintain ideal weight, or almost two years for the Labrador retrievers in the survey. Veterinarians have used expensive motion sensors for years to study pet activity levels, but they say the new devices aimed at pet owners have the potential to be used far more broadly. “I’m very excited about the activity monitors,” said Dr. Ernie Ward, a veterinarian and founder of the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention. The solitude of pets is another concern that technology is tackling. Many animals spend hours alone at home while their owners are at the office. Separation anxiety, lack of exercise and other factors can lead to destructive tendencies. Dropcam is a wireless security camera that can also be used as a pet monitor. It has a microphone and speaker so people can both speak to and hear their pets via a mobile app.  I used a Dropcam to spy on Mitzi, who had positioned herself on a couch in my living room while I was out of the house. Through the speaker, I ordered her down. She cocked her head like the RCA dog and stared at the camera — and didn’t move. I’m hoping for an update of the product that includes pet obedience. A device called Petcube, coming out in May, combines a webcam, microphone and speakers with a low-intensity laser pointer, the direction of which can be controlled remotely through a smartphone. Owners will be able to play games with their cats and dogs using the laser, assuming the animals are receptive to the idea of chasing a bright red light around a room. People will be able to invite Facebook friends to play with their pets, too, by sharing access to their Petcubes. While cats seem to pursue lasers without problems, Dr. Margaret Gruen, a veterinary behaviorist at North Carolina State University, said using a laser pointer with dogs could lead them to become shadow and light chasers, a compulsive behavior. Dr. Gruen said it was unclear what effect owners talking to their pets through a webcam could have. “When they can’t see them, will that be confusing or comforting?” she said. “I don’t think we know yet.” There are effective medications and behavior changes for treating separation anxiety in pets, and playing classical music while an owner is gone can relax dogs, too, Dr. Gruen said. While it isn’t clear yet whether these new technologies actually improve the lives of pets, they are certainly likely to answer the emotional needs of many pet parents. Remember the Baby Einstein DVDs, said to enhance the intellectual development of infants? “There’s this industry that springs up around selling highly specialized products that will allow you to feel like you’re doing a better job of parenting,” said Aaron Easterly, the chief executive of the dog-sitting website Rover.com. “It’s really the exact same pitch for these products.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/11/2014, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: With Technology, Every Dog Has Its Data.

Society   Finally Arriving at Romance. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIMARCH 9, 2014 Dr. Diana Cristina Montoya-Fontalvo, a daughter of Miryam I. Fontalvo-Montoya and Luis F. Montoya of Gainesville, Fla., was married there Saturday evening to Dr. Brendan Alexander Williams, the son of R. Kay Tolle and Wendell S. Williams of Silver Spring, Md. Dr. Daphna Yasova Barbeau, a Florida notary, officiated, with the Rev. Alberto Esposito, a Roman Catholic priest, taking part in the ceremony, at the home of the bride’s parents. The couple met at Columbia, from which they each received a medical degree. They are now second-year residents with theUniversity of Florida Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, the bride in pediatrics, the groom in orthopedic surgery. The bride, 28, graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. Her parents retired as owners of Lightronix Research Laboratories, an electrical engineering consultancy in Gainesville. Her father was an electrical engineer, her mother a metallurgical engineer. The groom, 30, graduated from Princeton University. His mother is a social worker at the Ivymount School in Rockville, Md., which offers school- and community-based services for children and young adults with special needs. His father is a psychologist for the Department of Defense in Washington. Dr. Montoya-Fontalvo and Dr. Williams began their friendship as study partners at Columbia in August 2007, helping each other through the rigors of medical school by listening to music and taking frequent television breaks together. Advertisement “From our early interactions at school orientations, there was an instant connection,” Dr. Williams said. “We both loved to dance and we also found that we shared an interest for working with children.” Dr. Montoya-Fontalvo and Dr. Williams soon found themselves spending their free time together, going to Central Park, restaurants and nightclubs. They were falling in love, but the timing wasn’t right. “I was already in a relationship that was slowly dying,” Dr. Montoya-Fontalvo said. “Brendan kind of patiently waited until I was firmly single before he made a play for me.” During their first and second years of medical school, they traveled together to Ecuador as volunteers for the Child Family Health International program. Dr. Williams spent four weeks at various hospitals in Quito observing surgeries while Dr. Montoya-Fontalvo spent four weeks in Puyo learning about indigenous medicines and visiting rural clinics along the Amazon border. Before returning home, they spent leisure time in the Galápagos Islands, where the timing was right to begin falling in love. “He is this unique combination of a free spirit who is driven and motivated, just like me,” Dr. Montoya-Fontalvo said of Dr. Williams. “He’s the kind of person who enjoys dancing on a beach and yet puts in enough hours to one day become a successful surgeon. I admire that.” VINCENT M. MALLOZZI A version of this article appears in print on March 9, 2014, on page ST18 of the New York edition with the headline: Finally Arriving at Romance.

Sports   Intrigue Over Jackson Continues to Percolate. Advertisement Advertisement By SCOTT CACCIOLAMARCH 9, 2014 As far back as 15 years ago, the Knicks looked to Phil Jackson to help rescue them. Now, after all these years of yearning, it seems possible that he will rejoin the team, with whom he was a championship player more than 40 years ago. James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, recently met with Jackson while on the West Coast, according to a person in the N.B.A. with knowledge of the situation. There has been increasing speculation that Jackson, 68, might agree to take a leadership role in the Knicks’ front office, although he has never had that sort of role in his distinguished N.B.A. career. A return to the Knicks by Jackson would be a public-relations boon for a franchise that is in dire straits and fearful that its best player, Carmelo Anthony, will go elsewhere when he can opt out of his contract at the end of the season. The presence of Jackson could persuade Anthony to stay — assuming Jackson agreed that Anthony should remain the Knicks’ centerpiece in coming seasons. Todd Musburger, Jackson’s agent, did not return a message seeking comment. A Knicks spokesman declined to comment. If Jackson were to take a front-office position with the Knicks, it is unclear how that might affect Steve Mills, who in his first year as the team’s general manager has made very few personnel moves, even as the Knicks have continued their plunge from a 54-28 record last season. Advertisement Even with a 107-97 victory over Cleveland on Saturday night, the Knicks are an almost unthinkable 24-40. Yet they still have an outside chance of claiming a playoff spot in a weak Eastern Conference. While winning a record 11 championships as a coach, with the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers, Jackson established a reputation as a person who speaks freely. That runs counter to the way the Knicks have typically operated under Dolan, who has restrictive policies when it comes to his employees’ interactions with the news media. However, when Donnie Walsh, an esteemed, longtime N.B.A. executive, ran the Knicks’ front office, from 2008 to 2011, he insisted on operating without those sort of restrictions, and Jackson might choose to do the same. Jackson has not coached since he left the Lakers after the 2010-11 season. They are now in the midst of a season as tumultuous as the Knicks’, which has raised questions about the future of Lakers Coach Mike D’Antoni. But for now, the speculation is focused not on a Jackson reunion with the Lakers, but with the Knicks, who have not won a title since Jackson wore the team’s uniform.

Travel   George Takei Reflects on Travel, Both Painful and Pleasurable. Advertisement Advertisement By RACHEL LEE HARRISMARCH 7, 2014 George Takei is a man of many speaking engagements. He talks at “Star Trek” conventions about his role as Mr. Sulu. He tells soldiers and students about the role of Japanese-Americans during World War II, a subject in which he is well versed. In a new musical, “Allegiance,” based on his family’s experience living in internment camps during the war, he actually sings the story. With one million Twitter followers, he is also a major Internet presence, which leads to more talking — on news shows, usually about his political activism. And in January, he was chatting up crowds at the Sundance Film Festival, promoting a new documentary about his life, “To Be Takei: A Star’s Trek for Life, Liberty and Love.” (Mr. Takei and his husband, Brad Takei, have homes in Los Angeles, Arizona and New York City.) In May, Mr. Takei, 76, will do a speaking tour at universities in Japan and Korea, organized by the State Department, to talk about his life and career as an openly gay Asian-American. Below are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Takei. Q. Why were you speaking at military bases in Bavaria a few years back? A. May is Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month, and about five years ago the military decided they needed to know more about the Asian-American contribution to our military. I spoke at every American base in southern Bavaria and described some of the battles. I talked about the absolutely amazing heroism of the Japanese-Americans during World War II, young men who came from behind barbed-wired internment camps, who were labeled enemy non-aliens. They even took the word “citizen” from us. And yet, a year later, when they opened up service to us, thousands went to fight in Europe, in a segregated unit. When they came back, they were welcomed back on the White House lawn. Advertisement Where was your family interned during World War II? I will never forget that scary day. My parents were packing, and I saw two soldiers with bayonets march up to our front door, and we were marched out simply because of our ancestry. We were taken to a swamp in Arkansas and later to California. Do you travel there?  I’ve gone back many times to Arkansas. First in 2004, to verify my childhood memories: the lush forest, the pools of water. As we drove down, it was miles and miles of cotton fields, and I didn’t recognize any of it. Our guide told us the swamp was drained and the forest was chopped down. There was no evidence of the camp having been there, except for the cemetery, which had been maintained by a Japanese-American family that remained there. The most prominent marker was a crumbling concrete pylon with an eagle on the top listing the names of the men who went from that camp to perish on the bloody battlefields. It was wrenching. I owe the America I enjoy today to those incredible, crazy young men. But let me put in a good word for Little Rock, Ark. We are great fans of the Clintons and contributed to the Clinton Library there. My autobiography, where I talk about my childhood in the camp in Arkansas, is in that library. Where do you travel for pleasure?  I’m an Anglophile, so usually London for theater. And Japan. I’m fascinated with Japanese history and its relationship to the United States. What are your favorite places in Japan?  We just love Nagoya, Kyoto, Nara, Hiroshima and, a short ferry ride from Hiroshima, the sacred island called Miyajima, or the “shrine island,” where the lovely Itsukushima Shrine looks like it’s floating in the bay. There is no hospital there because no one should be born or die on that island. We love to stay at ryokans, Japanese inns. These are all ancient inns — as a matter of fact, there is a separate residence for the emperor at one in Miyajima, called Iwaso, on the side of a ravine. You go off and tour around and when you come back, they give you a cotton kimono and suggest you have a good soak in the mineral bath. By the time you come up, your room has been transformed into a dining room with a low jet-black lacquer table set with kaiseki, a tasting menu with a dozen different dishes. Then you go down the path to visit the temple in moonlight. When you come back, your room is transformed again into a bedroom. There is an inn in Nara, Kikusuiryo-ryo, which translates into English as “chrysanthemum water inn.” There is a great big beautiful Japanese garden there you can stroll through. Incongruously, in your room is a huge 60 or 70-inch Sony television. They have private mineral spring baths as well as a huge bath for everyone. You don’t seem to hold a grudge. Will you visit Arizona soon?  If the governor had not vetoed that bill, it would have been a very serious situation. What’s surprising is that Arizona’s Legislature is dominated by religious extremists that don’t really represent the people of Arizona. They embarrass the state, put a stain on the state’s reputation and do economic damage. They won’t be allowed to do that to such a beautiful state anymore. After your work with “Star Trek,” are you interested in space travel? Isn’t this an exciting new phase? I’m particularly impressed with Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla. He is such a visionary. And now free enterprise instead of government is going into space travel, and he’s going to provide the kind of shuttle service NASA used to, through SpaceX. Richard Branson is working on space tourism, which is also very exciting. So, yes, I do want to be in line for that kind of trip. An answer on March 9 in the Q&A column, about the actor George Takei, misidentified one of the camps in which he and his family were interned during World War II. They were indeed interned in Arkansas, but later were taken to California, not Wyoming. A version of this article appears in print on March 9, 2014, on page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: George Takei on Visiting Places of Past Stress and of Great Pleasure.

Business   About to Bloom. Advertisement By Mel Rosen Mar 11, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — It’s been a while since we’ve seen Mel Rosen. His last New York Times puzzle was the infamous “Question Box” grid, but he’s back today with a puzzle that hopefully will be more reliable in predicting the arrival of spring than Punxsutawney Phil. At first glance, Mr. Rosen’s theme seems to be a few random phrases that might or might not suggest an anagram theme, since the letters seem to be fairly common. What we actually have here, however, is one of those clever “take a common phrase and find other phrases that follow its directions” themes. More specifically, Mr. Rosen has found four phrases that all start with the letters “B-U” and end in “D” so that we have a theme that is, as 49 Down reveals, IN BUD. I don’t know about you, but I’m taking that as a warning to start a regular regimen of antihistamines. What I find interesting about this theme is that all four of the theme entries seem to be making their debuts in The New York Times puzzle, but the rest of the entries have been seen before. One thing that made me smile was that Mr. Rosen managed to get the word DONE (clued cleverly as “Puzzle solver’s happy shout”) at the very end of the solve. Clue of the Day for me was 39 Down’s “Volume that requires lots of preparations to compile?” for COOK BOOK. Let’s welcome Mr. Rosen back: Some puzzles can truly be characterized as “inspired.” This one, however, came from my “I really ought to compose a puzzle” muse. That said: Daily crosswords in most markets carry no titles; consequently, constructions utilizing a “reveal” entry appeal to me because they offer the solver an “aha” moment. “Reveal” entries are sometimes as long as the theme answer phrases: for example, the theoretical-but-probably-not-useful reveal AFTERMATH could be a hint for the same-length answer MAJOR DOMO (as in MATH MAJOR) as well as unrelated answers like SYMBOL FOR LEAD and TEST MARKET. Casting about for ideas for this puzzle I thought of IN BUD, which is apt for springtime. Then I found four suitable long entries that seem to be first-timers, which is always fun: BUms arounD, BUrma roaD, BUll-noseD, and BUttonwooD. As to the development of the grid: I don’t remember what I had for lunch yesterday, so other than making sure the reveal was in the grid — near the bottom to delay the “aha” — I honestly don’t recall if there were tricky regions of the construction. The grid design has lots of relatively isolated areas with many options everywhere. I knew I was aiming for Monday-Tuesday difficulty and tried to keep the fill on the straightforward side. And now, to take us to the Wednesday puzzle, Fats Waller and Thelonius Monk playing “LULU’s Back in Town”: Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Foreign   Welsh University to Open Mauritius Campus. Advertisement Advertisement By THE INTERNATIONAL NEW YORK TIMESMARCH 9, 2014 Aberystwyth University, in Wales, plans to open a campus on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius and begin offering academic programs there in September. Students at the campus, in Port Louis, the capital, will be awarded Aberystwyth University degrees, the university said last week, and courses will be taught in conjunction with a commercial provider of higher education on the island. “The government of Mauritius has ambitious plans to establish the country as an international knowledge hub and attract 100,000 students to study there over the next 10 years,” said April McMahon, an Aberystwyth professor who announced the plan in London. The Mauritius campus will initially offer four undergraduate degrees and a Master of Science in international business, subject to accreditation by the education authorities on Mauritius. Aberystwyth will be the second British university on the island, after Middlesex University opened a campus there in January 2010. — CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE   Harvard retains top spot in survey of academics Harvard University remains the world’s most reputable university among academics, according to an annual ranking by Times Higher Education in London. In the four years since the magazine started the World Reputation Rankings in 2011, Harvard has led the list every year. Advertisement Almost half of the Top 100 universities — as ranked by 10,536 academics from 133 countries who participated in the survey — were based in the United States. The number of American universities in the Top 100 rose to 46 this year from 43 in 2013, the magazine said Thursday. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was ranked second, followed by Stanford University, which was sixth last year. After the United States, the country with the most universities on the list was Britain, with 10. The University of Cambridge was fourth and the University of Oxford was fifth, and they were the only non-American institutions in the Top 10. Germany had six universities in the Top 100, Australia and Japan each had five, and the Netherlands had four. — PETER TEFFER A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Science   The Monitored Man Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Personal technology for health and fitness. For years, health advocates have been telling us to move more. But just how much more? A multitude of activity tracking devices now promise to answer that question. Generally, these digital monitors, which can be worn around the wrist, on collars and belts, even as jewelry, record how and how much you move throughout the day. Some aim to do a great deal more. Makers of the devices have begun intensive campaigns aimed at convincing the large population of “worried well” consumers to get wired and start recording their every move. We tested some of the latest and most popular trackers to compare how they work and the various features they offer. Here’s what we found. High-tech fitness and activity trackers all share one thing: an accelerometer. Here’s how they work — and don’t. How well do these work? Curious about the benefits and limits, I’ve been testing as many different models as possible — wearing them day and night for six months, 11 models in all, sometimes four at once. I’ve learned a great deal about these gadgets. And about myself. I’d thought I was a fairly active person: I bike to work most days and hit the gym or get other physical activity two or three times a week. The trackers, on the other hand, showed that aside from those spates of exercise, for the vast majority of each day I was completely sedentary. But that may not be the whole story. Activity trackers typically combine a wearable device with a website or smartphone app to view data collected about your movements. The goal is to measure not only your steps from the parking lot to your desk, but also your sedentary down time at work or in front of a television, bursts of intense exercise and even your sleep habits — all to create a complete picture of your most and least healthful behaviors. Some models also offer tips and set goals based on your data. The most popular models are made by Fitbit, Nike and Jawbone; the gadgets typically cost $60 to $200. Most are made of rubber and plastic and come in a choice of colors, with the notable exception of the Shine, made of metal by Misfit Wearables. In 2013, activity trackers generated an estimated $290 million in American retail sales, according to Ben Arnold, an analyst at New York’s NPD Group, who says the market could double this year. The sharp rise of trackers stems from advances in chip technology. The devices all share a common sensor, an accelerometer that can track movement in three dimensions (up and down, side to side, and forward and back). Accelerometers can now be made small enough and at a low enough cost that they can be embedded in almost anything. While all activity trackers have an accelerometer, some include additional sensors to pick up other signs of activity. BodyMedia makes an armband that measures perspiration and muscle heat for a more accurate assessment of activity level and calories burned. Basis Science sells the B1 Band watch, which measures heart rate, perspiration and skin temperature. The Pulse, from Withings of France, can measure resting heart rate. Many trackers estimate the length and fitfulness of sleep by sensing how much you move throughout the night. And Polar and Garmin both make trackers that can pair with chest straps to record heart rate during a workout. But even the best tracker can’t recognize all of your movements. As I sit writing this, my wrists are motionless, but my leg is tapping to music. My activity trackers don’t seem to notice — fidgeting won’t be reflected in the calorie counts they show me. That’s too bad, because there’s an interesting body of research suggesting that a propensity to fidget is one reason lean people stay lean. More surprisingly, perhaps, only the trackers made by Basis and BodyMedia gave me credit for being active when riding my bike. Most of the rest just sat on my wrist, recording no activity — and true enough, my wrist wasn’t moving much as I pedaled through the city traffic. All of them were more accurate when I was playing tennis. Activity trackers usually don’t measure exertion, only motion. Company officials say that intense exercise is just a small part of the average consumer’s day, and that it’s more useful to capture the bigger fitness picture. For “high-resistance, low-movement exercises, none of these work really well, including us,” said Sonny Vu, chief executive of Misfit Wearables. But “it’s the other 23 and a half hours that’s the most interesting.” Despite the occasional gaps, I found tracking to be useful if I focused less on the precise numbers and more on day-to-day variations in activity. Comparing the 16,000 steps I take on some weekend days to the 6,000 or 7,000 on a typical workday made me work harder to move more on weekdays. Can trackers really change behavior in people? Last year, Dr. Rajani Larocca, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, conducted a six-week lifestyle program for 10 patients with diabetes ages 50 to 70 that included weekly sessions to encourage exercise and healthful eating; each participant also was outfitted with a Fitbit Zip tracker. “Every single person increased their activity,” Dr. Larocca said. “People felt more knowledgeable.” Eight months later, about half the patients from the group still wear a tracker. Researchers at the Center for Connected Health in Boston have been giving activity trackers to subjects for six to nine months, then studying changes in their behavior. Dr. Kamal Jethwani, head of research at the center, said he saw three distinct groups of people among study participants. About 10 percent are “quantified selfers” with an affinity for this kind of feedback; just by looking at the numbers, they are motivated to be more active. An additional 20 percent to 30 percent need some encouragement in addition to tracker data to effectively change their behavior. But most of the subjects observed by Dr. Jethwani don’t understand the data and need help making sense of it. For them, he said, social motivation from a friend or joining a team or workplace challenge may be more effective. I figure I’m in the second group, the ones who need a little push. One of my favorite features is the Jawbone UP’s inactivity alert. I set mine to vibrate on my wrist if I haven’t moved in the past hour. And Jawbone’s smartphone app offers personalized tips that are actually interesting. For instance: “When you go to bed 30 minutes later than average, you tend to take 971 fewer steps the next day.” And after several late nights, I was told: “Go to bed before 12:44 a.m.” Well, O.K. Other trackers, like Fitbit’s, have tried to increase motivation by focusing on short-term goals — making it to 10,000 steps each day, for example. The Basis tracker awards points for keeping to “streaks” of healthy activity, like the number of days you’re active for more than 30 minutes. Of the trackers I tested, Nike’s FuelBand put the strongest emphasis on competition with friends. But almost all the apps now have social features allowing you to share your activities, offer encouragement and hold one another accountable for goals. All the data you’re recording is tied to a particular company’s software, so you can’t take it along if you decide to switch tracking devices. But many allow calorie data to be shared with other apps, like MyFitnessPal or LoseIt. Having worn more of these trackers than any human should, I have to admit I am less captivated than I once was. Now I almost never look at the data that they collect. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. “The goal should not be to make people wear the activity tracker for the whole year,” Dr. Jethwani said. “It’s to have them wear it when it’s meaningful” — that is, when better habits start to slip away. These days, I’ve become keenly aware of how active I am and how active I need to be in order to feel healthy and energized. I don’t need a monitor anymore. I’m tracking me. Have you used an activity or fitness tracker? Tell us about it. A version of this article appears in print on 03/11/2014, on page D1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Monitored Man.

Sports   Photos: The Big East’s Garden Party. Advertisement Advertisement By LYNN ZINSERMARCH 12, 2014 The way the Big East tells it, this year’s men’s basketball tournament represents a return to the conference’s roots as a group of proud basketball schools that escaped from under the thumb of all-powerful college football to revel in their sport’s greatness. And they will do it at Madison Square Garden, the conference tournament’s home since 1983. In reality, the Big East’s current membership would stump most “Jeopardy” contestants, and the gathering is certain to feel haunted by the ghosts of departed stalwarts like Syracuse, Connecticut and Pittsburgh. In 1983, when the conference talked its way into the World’s Most Famous Arena, after three years of shuttling among less famous ones, there were no ghosts lurking in the Garden’s hallways. There was just Commissioner Dave Gavitt and his audacious creation, a nine-team cabal with an ESPN contract, riding a wave that would lift college basketball to unimagined heights in the world of television and entertainment. The conference’s initial tournament, in 1980, had been played — and rather sparsely attended — at the Providence Civic Center, which made sense because Gavitt was Providence College’s former coach and put the conference’s first headquarters there. The tournament migrated to Syracuse’s Carrier Dome in 1981, where more than 15,000 people watched the title game. They were treated to Syracuse’s three-overtime victory over Villanova, which raised the league’s profile. By the time the Big East tournament went to the Hartford Civic Center in 1982, Georgetown had Patrick Ewing in the fold and the big time was beckoning. Moving to the Garden came with a little controversy. People believed it gave St. John’s a home-court advantage because it played many home games there. To that, St. John’s Coach Lou Carnesecca scoffed. “There is no such thing as a hometown advantage,” Carnesecca said. “For one thing, the refs don’t want to be called homers. For another, the fans are not as provincial here as other places. If you play well, O.K. If you don’t, you’d better wear a helmet.” St. John’s, powered by Chris Mullin and David Russell, won that first tournament at the Garden, but as if to prove Carnesecca prophetic, it won only two more in the next 30 years. But unlike many of the combatants of those early tournaments, St. John’s is still in the Big East, trying to win more. Go to Home Page »

Travel   A Ski Pass for the States — and Japan. Advertisement Vail Resorts already offers holders of its season Epic Pass access to all 10 resorts it operates primarily in Colorado, Utah and the Lake Tahoe region. Next year the pass will include ski days in a more distant locale: Japan. The 2014/2015 Epic Pass, which goes on sale Monday for $729, will include five consecutive days at Niseko United, a ski area 60 miles south of Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido. Skiing in Japan is certainly more complicated to get to than Colorado for most Americans, but partnering with the Asian destination was intended in part to appeal to Epic Pass holders in the Asia Pacific region, specifically Australia, one of the top foreign markets for visits to its resorts, said Kirsten Lynch, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Vail Resorts. According to the company, pass holders represent 50 states and 80 countries, and almost half of all season pass holders reside outside Colorado, where the company operates Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone. To test the willingness of holders to travel on its pass, Vail Resorts held a race this year to reward the first 10 skiers or snowboarders to ski at all of the mountains on the pass – which was 24 in 2013-14 – with a season pass for life. “Internally, we thought 30 to 70 would sign up for it,” Ms. Lynch. said. “But 340 signed up for it. At least 150 have finished it, and the season isn’t over yet.” Bragging rights apparently are an equally motivating prize.

Business   I’m Buying!. Advertisement By Jeff Chen Mar 12, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — This is one of those themes where you would be well-advised not to be drinking a beverage when that “Aha!” moment comes, lest you blow said beverage out your nose. I’m just warning you. I knew we were doing some sort of beverage theme when I dropped MILK and JUICE into Jeff Chen’s puzzle, because it’s just too much of a coincidence to have such similar clues and entries next to each other. Most of the TEA that I drink isn’t “tan,” but it was easy enough to guess that one. So what we end up with, at the end of today’s solve, is DRINKS ALL AROUND the grid, and the reveal stretched across the center. Nicely done, Mr. Chen. And it’s a fairly smooth solve, too. The only place I hit a speed bump was at 25 Across’s C.S.A. (Confederate States of America) I knew that R.E. Lee had to be Robert E. Lee, and that C.S.A. had to be Confederate States of America, and yet it just would not go in. Thank goodness for crossings. In nontheme news, I enjoyed SNOOKERED, TOONIE and PAPER DOLL.

Science   Steel-Cut Oats With Amaranth Seeds, Chia Seeds and Blueberries. Advertisement Advertisement Recipes for Health By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN MARCH 10, 2014 Fresh blueberries are not in season at the moment, so I put my frozen organic wild blueberries to good use in this hearty mix. The chia and the amaranth pump up the nutritional value of this cereal — both are high in calcium, amaranth is high in protein, and chia seeds are a great source of healthful omega-3s. They also contribute texture. For even more great texture, top the cereal with chopped toasted hazelnuts or almonds. Total time: 5 minutes (plus overnight soaking) For each bowl: 1/4 cup regular or quick cooking steel-cut oats 1 tablespoon amaranth seeds 1 teaspoon chia seeds Salt to taste (I use a generous pinch) 1 heaped tablespoon fresh or frozen blueberries, or more to taste (out of season I recommend small frozen wild blueberries) 3/4 cup water 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup, plus more as desired for drizzling Optional toppings: milk, chopped toasted skinned hazelnuts, chopped toasted almonds, grated apple or pear, freeze-dried blueberries Advertisement 1. The night before, stir together steel-cut oats, amaranth seeds, chia seeds, salt and blueberries in a medium microwave-proof bowl. Bring water to a boil and pour over mixture. Add honey or maple syrup and stir, then cover bowl with a plate. 2. In the morning, microwave mixture for 2 minutes on 100 percent power. Remove bowl from microwave and carefully remove plate (bowl will be hot and steam will rise from cereal). Stir mixture, cover again and return to microwave. Heat for 2 minutes more, or until mixture is no longer watery. 3. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle on toppings of your choice.

Sports   Islanders Score 7 Goals in 3rd Period to Top Canucks. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSMARCH 11, 2014 VANCOUVER, British Columbia — Matt Martin scored the winner in the Islanders’ seven-goal third period, and New York erased a three-goal deficit in the final frame to beat the Vancouver Canucks 7-4 on Monday night. Martin made it 5-4 at 10:04 for the third for the Islanders, who reversed a recent trend and rallied late instead of squandering a lead. Josh Bailey, Ryan Strome, Calvin de Haan, Frans Nielsen, Anders Lee and Cal Clutterbuck also scored for the Islanders (25-33-9), who scored four times in the first 6:22 of the third. The Islanders tied the team record for goals in a period, matching the mark set in the second period of a 9-4 win over the New York Rangers on Dec. 23, 1978. Chris Higgins, Henrik Sedin, Ryan Kesler and Chris Tanev scored for the Canucks (29-28-10), who lost for the 12th time in 14 games. Advertisement Evgeni Nabokov made 20 saves in the win. Eddie Lack stopped 21 shots for the Canucks. The Islanders let two-goal leads get away in the third periods of losses to Edmonton and Calgary on consecutive nights last week. New York went 2-1-1 on its four-game trip and improved to 8-22-2 when trailing after two periods this season. The Islanders are only 9-6-5 when leading after two. Vancouver was ahead 1-0 after the first period and 3-0 following the second before allowing the Islanders back in it. New York’s first three goals came on power plays, and Nielsen’s goal came right after another Vancouver penalty had expired. Higgins opened the scoring on a power play at 15:16 when he put in a backhand after Yannick Weber’s slap shot hit the post. Henrik Sedin put the Canucks ahead 2-0 at 4:52 of the second as he put a shot in off Clutterbuck from the behind the net for his first goal in 24 games. Canucks rookie Nicklas Jensen, recently called up from the AHL, earned his first NHL point with an assist. Kesler made it 3-0 about five minutes later when he put in Kevin Bieksa’s rebound off the goal post. Alex Burrows earned an assist for his 300th NHL point. Advertisement Bailey started the comeback at 1:13 of the third while Jensen was serving a slashing penalty that carried over from the second period. Strome and de Haan scored power-play goals 22 seconds apart to tie it. Nielsen put the Islanders ahead 4-3 just under three minutes later with a shot from the wing. The crowd let out a huge roar of relief when Tanev tied it 4-4 at 9:54. Martin, however, gave the Isles the lead only 10 seconds later on a backhand from the slot, and Lee padded New York’s lead 1:44 after that. Lee put in Okposo’s rebound off defenseman Dan Hamhuis, who had tended the goal while Lack was caught out of position following the initial save on the first of three New York shots. Clutterbuck added an empty-net goal in the final minute. NOTES: The Islanders had seven rookies in their lineup. ... New York lost forward Michael Grabner late in the second period after he collided with Tanev. ... Canucks forward Zack Kassian served the second of a three-game suspension. ... Islanders D Thomas Hickey is the only player to dress for all of New York’s 67 games this season. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Hotel Discounts for Egencia Users. Advertisement An increasing number of travelers are turning to their smart phones and tablets to make travel arrangements on the fly. In turn, hotels, travel Web sites and application developers seem to be scrambling to offer more services via mobile applications. Egencia, the business travel brand of Expedia, has made headway in that area recently, launching “mobile-only” hotel discounts for Egencia members who book through its Trip Navigator app. The discounts give 10 to 50 percent off regular room rates at more than 7,000 partner hotels in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East and Africa, according to a statement from the company. More than a third of those hotels will also allow users to accrue loyalty points through these bookings and will waive same-day cancellation fees. Egencia members can search for discounted rates through the company’s Trip Navigator app, which was released in November 2013. In addition to providing a mobile reservation and booking service, it allows users to view a detailed timeline of their travel plans, including flights, car rentals, hotel reservations and rail service, along with an interactive map for each stage of their trip. Flight status updates and connection to Egencia’s travel consultants are also available through the app, which is compatible with iOS devices. Until the company launches its version for Android devices–expected within the next few months–those members can access the service through Egencia’s mobile booking Web site.

Business   Kid’s Art Activity. Advertisement By Alex Vratsanos Mar 13, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — To whom do you silently give thanks when you solve a New York Times crossword puzzle? Of course, there’s editor Will Shortz; we wouldn’t be having this discussion if he didn’t select seven crosswords each week for us to dig into. I’m talking about those who have taught you the popular and sometimes arcane things you need to know in order to be a decent solver. I’m not ritually observant, but I mutter a special “thank you” under my breath to all of the people I’ve learned things from that help me solve my crossword puzzles. My mother first sat me down and made me watch the gorgeous movie based on Edna FERBER’s novel “Giant” so I could moon over James Dean and Rock Hudson with her, but she had no idea that I was also taking in more information than how handsome the stars were. I also thank The Boy for being obsessed with the history of video games, so I could confidently write in EIGHT-BIT at 10 Down (and he thinks I’m not listening!). While we’re busy thanking people, let’s stop to thank Alex Vratsanos, who constructed today’s COLOR BY NUMBERS-themed puzzle for us. I saw the hint at 13 Down that warned me there would be something extra to look out for, but it took me a while to actually see the colors emerge. This is why it pays to read the documentation, people; for some reason (I’m pleading fever), I thought that maybe the colors would be crossing the numbers, but that’s not what Mr. Vratsanos said, is it? He said they would be BY the numbers, and by golly, there they are. In the northwest, we have SIX sitting closely by RED, in the northeast we have EIGHT by BLACK, the southwest has THREE by GREEN, and the southeast has ONE by TAN. In nontheme news, I had to look up the only film to have won Best Picture that was RATED X (1969’s “Midnight Cowboy”). I also didn’t immediately recall that the Boston legend Phil was Phil ESPOsito (apologies, Boston fans) or who Conrad NAGEL was. Also, I learned to spell Rembrandt’s name as RIJN, not RYN, and spent more time than I care to tell hovering over that three-letter entry muttering “Maybe it’s a rebus…” Once I got over that hump, however, I went back to thanking people. One of the things I love about crossword puzzles, even more than the technical proficiency it takes to construct them (which is considerable and which I greatly respect), is the warm feelings that the puzzle entries evoke for me. Let’s learn more about Mr. Vratsanos’s construction: I don’t quite remember exactly when this theme came to me but, according to my files, my original draft dates back to March 2013. That original draft was not as good as what you now see; BLACK OPS / EIGHT BIT was there, but opposite it was NINE IRON / BLUE NILE, which is not very elegant because of the differing lengths of the colors and numbers as well as their positions in the entries. The other themers were even less elegant, as they were not directly on top of one another (I had been working with horizontal themers up to this point): TEN SPOT was at the right of row 5, and NO TURN ON RED was at the left of row 6. Yes, TEN was right on top of RED, but now BLACK OPS / EIGHT BIT was the only theme pair that was not “number by color” (the other pair was ONE SHOT DEAL / FAKE TAN). A few months later, I tried it again, and it was a step forward, but it did take some more drafting after that to come up with this grid. Even after it was accepted on Jan. 16, I continued to play around with it, but now that it is in The New York Times, I am very satisfied with my work and Will’s. Will did a great job with the clues (I loved his clue for MARGIN), but his biggest contribution was making the themers vertical — much more appropriate considering the revealer. Wish I’d thought to do that, having liked Joe DiPietro’s “Bywords” a few months before it all started for this puzzle. All that said, it’s been a winding road for me since my last New York Times [puzzle] … Jeff Chen and I had sent that puzzle a couple weeks before I reported to the University of Delaware for what proved to be my last semester there. Since then, I’ve found an affinity for numbers at a different school and did really well in my macroeconomics classes there. In fact, I am seriously thinking of making a career of accounting. I hope you all enjoy solving it as much as I did making it! (Would you say I’ve thrown AN AX AT SOLVERS with it?) We wish you well in your studies and hope to see more puzzles from you in the future, Mr. Vratsanos. Let’s move on to the Friday puzzle by following the character of “Joe Buck” in the movie “Midnight Cowboy”: Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Foreign   Offering a German Lesson for Asia’s History Wars. Advertisement ‘‘Why not let him visit the Holocaust memorial?’’ asked Chan Koonchung, a Beijing-based Hong Kong writer, of President Xi Jinping of China. Mr. Chan, the author of ‘‘The Fat Years,’’ a novel about an überconfident China, was talking about media reports that the German government did not want the Chinese leader to make an official visit to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe during his visit to Berlin this month. With its intimate experience of the difficult intellectual debates and honesty needed to work through a national trauma of totalitarianism and wartime aggression, the German government feared being dragged into the history wars between China and Japan over World War II, Reuters and Der Spiegel reported.  For months, senior Chinese and Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, had traded veiled and not-so-veiled barbs about who was more dangerous to peace in Asia — a rising, undemocratic China, or a Japan whose prime minister prayed at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, where 14 Class A war criminals are honored. Fueling the tensions was a dispute over islands in the East China Sea that are claimed by both countries. On Jan. 24, Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, appeared to drag Germany into the quarrel when it posted on Twitter an iconic photograph of Willy Brandt, the late German chancellor, on his knees in Warsaw in 1970 in front of a memorial to the Jews murdered by Nazi Germany, in a gesture of humility that stunned and impressed the world. ‘‘Only a correct attitude towards history can shape future: Chinese Ambassador,’’ Xinhua said. Japan, implied China, lacked Mr. Brandt’s ‘‘correct attitude.’’ Yet neither Japan nor China was ‘‘correct,’’ Mr. Chan said. In 2011, appreciating the depth of the problem, he and other intellectuals tried to organize a conference of Japanese and Chinese historians willing to talk — honestly, painfully — about the past. It was to take place in 2012, the 75th anniversary of the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, when Japanese soldiers went on a deadly rampage in the Chinese city. The Chinese government says at least 300,000 Chinese were killed in Nanjing, while other estimates have ranged from 30,000 to 200,000. Last month, Beijing declared two days of national remembrance — one on Dec. 13, for the massacre, and one on Sept. 3, to mark the victory over Japan in 1945. Yet the war is so politicized in China, and dislike of Japan runs so deep in some quarters, that it was hard to find Chinese historians willing to challenge the state’s narrative, Mr. Chan said. Over all, China’s record of truth-telling about its own past was poor. There were real issues to face, such as collaboration during the war. But in the absence of honest discussion, what was the point of a conference? Mr. Chan gave up. For historical reasons Berlin could have been a good place to hold such an event, he said, but ‘‘it never got into the planning stage.’’ Meanwhile, the reports that Germany rejected Mr. Xi’s Holocaust memorial visit seem to have alarmed officials in Berlin, who need China’s support for a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine, where Russia has effectively seized Crimea. On Sunday, in a call with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Mr. Xi offered his support and Ms. Merkel told Mr. Xi she was ‘‘very happy’’ about his coming visit, a spokesman said. So far, no itinerary has been announced. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, Konrad Lax, said that was merely because it was too early. ‘‘We were not negative or laggardly towards the wishes of the Chinese delegation,’’ Mr. Lax said. Another German official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an itinerary would probably be known on March 21. If Mr. Xi wants to visit the memorial, he can do so privately, the official said. ‘‘It’s often the case that visiting heads of state’’ undertake activities ‘‘that are not part of the official program,’’ he said. Mr. Chan, for one, hopes Mr. Xi will see the memorial. The president might learn something about history, about truth-telling and about reconciliation, he said.

Science   Questions About a Popular Heart Procedure. Advertisement Our great-great-grandparents probably didn’t have to think much about the way the heart’s aortic valve slowly stiffens and narrows over decades, a condition called aortic stenosis. Most of them died before they could experience its distressing symptoms — shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, fainting. Now, an estimated quarter of a million older adults get that diagnosis annually. When the stenosis becomes severe, they have to grapple with their medical options, a decision becoming steadily more complicated. “There’s no real medical therapy for this” – no drug, that is – “because it’s a mechanical problem,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale University. For decades, the standard treatment has been aortic valve replacement surgery: opening the chest and stopping the heart to replace the malfunctioning valve. “That used to be the only treatment that improved symptoms and survival,” said Dr. Dae Hyun Kim, a gerontologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Once older people develop symptoms, about half die within two years. Surgery drastically reduces that risk. Still, it is such a big operation that about a third of elderly patients either decide to avoid it or are warned they won’t survive it. Dr. Krumholz, senior author of a recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association looking at the surgery’s growing use and declining mortality risk, calls it “a technique that’s been around for decades, that’s getting better, but that is traumatic.”  Enter a newcomer, transcatheter aortic valve replacement. T.A.V.R., as it is known, involves a catheter, usually inserted through the groin, that delivers a new valve without a big incision and sometimes without general anesthesia. The Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2011 for patients whose aortic stenosis is considered inoperable, then in 2012 for the larger group of patients deemed “high risk” (an expansion skeptics call “indication creep”). It sounded like a big step forward. “Here was this new, sexy-sounding procedure that had a huge amount of press,” said Dr. Torrey Simons, a palliative care specialist at Stanford University who has been analyzing the operation’s cost-effectiveness. If you watch television in New York, you might have seen ads for NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in which lively older women testified to their happy experiences with T.A.V.R. “No stitches, no pain and in three days, I was home,” an 83-year-old announces. “Unbelievable.” She was particularly lucky, perhaps. Appearing in the same issue of JAMA with Dr. Krumholz’s article was a review of the first 7,710 procedures reported to a national T.A.V.R. registry. The study reported that the median hospital stay was six days, two of them in intensive care. Moreover, patients who opt for the transcatheter procedure face complications that in some cases outweigh those of traditional surgery. The most sobering is stroke: Data from a subset of the registry shows that within 30 days, 2.8 percent of T.A.V.R. patients (median age 84) had had a stroke, 2.5 percent needed to begin kidney dialysis, and 7.6 percent had died, about half of noncardiac causes. After a year, all those measures were higher. Some T.A.V.R. patients need pacemakers or sustain blood vessel damage. A minority see no meaningful improvement in their condition. “It’s still a relatively new technique, and there’s still a learning curve,” Dr. Krumholz said. Traditional aortic valve replacement surgery has a lower stroke risk, and its 30-day mortality rate – 4.2 percent in 2011, according to the JAMA study, a review of 12 years of Medicare records – is lower than that reported to the T.A.V.R. registry. But most patients require longer hospitalizations – a risk in itself to vulnerable older people, which almost by definition these are – and longer recoveries. In both cases, the procedure corrects problems with a single organ. Most patients in their 80s and 90s have multiple chronic diseases. “Fixing one abnormality out of many may not make a huge difference to a patient,” Dr. Kim cautioned. “It doesn’t necessarily translate to better long-term outcomes or a better life.” He and his colleagues recently reviewed 62 T.A.V.R. studies. Many were small and of questionable quality, the team found. They concluded that while most patients with aortic stenosis had reduced symptoms and better physical functioning after the procedure, improvements in general health and on psychological measures were modest. Moreover, some medical centers – about 250 now offer T.A.V.R. – have better results than others. “I’m very concerned that we’re subjecting a lot of people to a procedure that sounds like it makes so much sense before we have all the data,” Dr. Simons said. How are patients faced with these choices – assuming they are surgical candidates and have a choice – supposed to understand the trade-offs? (If you or a family member has undergone treatment for aortic stenosis, please tell us about it below.) Naftali Zvi Frankel knows firsthand how bewildering the decision can be. His grandfather, who received a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis last year, was eligible to join a clinical trial at a New York hospital. (Mr. Frankel declined to say which.) It would randomly assign him to receive conventional aortic valve surgery or T.A.V.R. “The phrasing used was ‘non-inferior,’ ” Mr. Frankel told me, meaning that one option was no worse than the other. Was that true? Mr. Frankel, a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Talmudic Studies in New York, told his grandfather he would find out. For more than a month he researched online, poring over medical journals. He even submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the state Department of Health to try to learn which surgeons and hospitals had the best outcomes. “These facts should be available to the consumer,” Mr. Frankel said. Writing about this experience in JAMA Internal Medicine, he noted that patients get “an idealized vision of T.A.V.R.” but not much information about its risks. His grandfather eventually decided on conventional surgery, recovered well and is living at home in Queens. But how many people can undertake that depth of research? Most will have to rely on carefully questioning their cardiologists and seeking second opinions. Perhaps most important, they will have to consider their own values as they approach the end of their lives. “There are no certainties,” Dr. Krumholz said. Each option involves risks – as does aortic stenosis itself, of course. “This is medicine in the modern age,” he said.

Travel   China, With You Behind the Wheel. Advertisement Steppes Travel, a London-based company specializing in high-end cultural and archaeological tours, has introduced a 10- to 15-day trip to China with a self-drive component. The itinerary starts in Beijing to see landmarks like the Summer Palace and Tiananmen Square. Travelers then take a high-speed train to Xian to see the terra-cotta warriors. The driving happens on the second half of the trip: travelers fly to Kunming,  the capital city of the Yunnan province in the country’s southwest, where they can get behind the wheel. The area is largely undiscovered but has one of the best road networks in China and is among its most picturesque regions; it’s where the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween Rivers descend from the Tibetan Plateau into lush valleys. The route takes travelers to the cobbled town of Shaxi, the town of Tacheng along the Yangtze, and the Meili Snow Mountain range, a sub-range of the Hengduan Mountains, which marks the boundary between Tibet and Yunnan.

Business   Singapore Government Firm Pursues Buyout of Olam International. Advertisement HONG KONG — Olam International, a Singapore agricultural commodities company that has been targeted by the short seller Carson C. Block, said on Friday that it had received a cash buyout offer led by a Singapore government investment firm valuing it at more than $4 billion. Temasek Holdings, the Singapore government investor, is leading a consortium of investors that already controls 52.5 percent of Olam. The buyout group is offering to pay 2.23 Singapore dollars, or $1.76, for each share they do not already own — a premium of about 12 percent to where the stock last traded. The deal values Olam at 5.3 billion dollars and the buyout consortium, which in addition to Temasek included a group of Olam’s founding shareholders and senior management, will have to pay 2.5 billion dollars for the shares they do not already own. In late 2012, Mr. Block’s firm, Muddy Waters Research, placed a bet that Olam’s shares would fall and launched a high-profile attack on the Singapore firm, likening it to Enron and saying it was at risk of collapsing. Olam mounted a vocal defense of itself and its accounting measures, which Mr. Block had targeted, and responded by suing in the Singaporean courts. The suit was later withdrawn. Olam’s shares rose only slightly after Temasek’s offer was announced Friday and were trading at about 2 dollars apiece. That was near their highest level in a year, and more than 10 percent above where Olam’s shares were trading in November 2012, when Mr. Block announced his bet against the stock. David Heng, a director of the Temasek unit leading the buyout bid, said that, if successful, they intend to maintain Olam’s Singapore listing. The bidders “share a common investment philosophy to invest and build for the long term,” Mr. Heng said. “We believe a successful offer will provide Olam with a stronger and more stable shareholder base to support Olam’s strategy and business model,” he added.

Home   Brown Is the New Green. Advertisement Advertisement In the Garden By STEVEN KURUTZ MARCH 12, 2014 Yolanda Muñoz was leading a double life, water-wise. As an accountant for the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, in Monterey, Calif., Ms. Muñoz heard grim predictions of water shortages and rationing as the state’s continuing drought intensified. But each night, she returned to her home in an older neighborhood on the peninsula, which had a lawn so large and lush she and her husband, Ed, put in a bench. “We had a beautiful parklike setting,” Ms. Muñoz said. “It had a lot of curb appeal. I hated to give up the lawn.” Still, it seemed like the only responsible thing to do. How could she continue to justify this profligate use of water in the face of such widespread shortages? Contemplating life without a lawn, she moved through the stages of grief, from anger (“I want this lawn!”) to bargaining (“We thought about doing a design where half the lawn would be saved and half ripped out, like a kidney shape”) to depression (“I felt it was kind of hypocritical of me”) and finally to acceptance (“We contacted Hill and Dale,” a local landscaping company). Four months ago, Ms. Muñoz replaced her guilty pasture with a mix of drought-tolerant plants and non-thirsty boulders and gravel. In place of the daily sprinkler rinse, she now has a water-conserving drip irrigation system. She is slowly adjusting to the native look, she said, scattering wildflower seeds that will sprout this spring. Advertisement With rainfall at below-normal levels for several years, and streams dry and reservoirs critically low, particularly in northern areas — even after the storms at the end of last month — many Californians are facing the reality that in the arid West the well-manicured lawn is no longer realistic, or even possible. Some cities have tightly restricted water use; others have raised usage rates to levels that make grass a luxury item. As for what constitutes a suitable alternative to the lawn, opinions abound. The Seaside Garden Center, on the Monterey Peninsula, recently held a workshop on artificial turf. Chuck Ingels, a horticulture adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension, in Sacramento, has experimented with meadow-like buffalo grass and dune sedge. And one Oakland couple is starting a neighborhood competition next month to promote replacing the lawn with vegetable gardens and native plants. Lorena Gonzalez, an assemblywoman whose district includes southern San Diego, believes “brown is beautiful,” as she put it, and has proposed a bill to allow residents of homeowners’ associations to put in drought landscaping or artificial turf or stop watering their grass without incurring fines. Meanwhile, in Beverly Hills and other affluent Southern California communities, bright-green, golf-course-plush, triple-fescue lawns remain as ubiquitous as the teams of gardeners required to tend them. • In true California fashion, the garden hose (or, more precisely, what comes out of it) has lately taken on a mystical bent. This weekend, Paola Berthoin, an artist, will be a leader of a retreat to explore the sacred nature of water. Participants will visit the Hastings Natural History Reserve in Carmel Valley, with its brittle, moisture-starved underbrush, and, among other activities, explore in a journal humankind’s connection to water. “We thought this was the best way to push the message out there that we are water,” Ms. Berthoin said. At her home in Carmel Valley, Ms. Berthoin’s water concerns are more practical. Though she has installed drought-tolerant and native-plant landscaping and seven tanks to collect rainwater, she worries about the two ponds on her seven-acre property. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with the ponds,” she said. “They’re not getting what they need.” Advertisement The recent storms across the state aren’t likely to squelch the soul-searching over proper drought landscaping, said Mitsugu Mori, the owner of the Seaside Garden Center. “Even if it rained every single day until April,” Mr. Mori said, “we don’t have enough water.” Grass has slowly been disappearing from California yards for several years, especially in cities that offer rebates to encourage homeowners to uproot (Ms. Muñoz paid for part of her lawn conversion this way). Menlo Park, for instance, has a Lawn Be Gone program that gives homeowners up to $3,000 if they convert their grass lawns to water-efficient landscapes. But the drought has sped up changes to the landscape, as homeowners opt for more eco-friendly, cost-saving options. Kathleen Brenzel, the garden editor of Sunset magazine, who lives in Menlo Park, said several of her neighbors have recently pulled up their lawns, planting meadows or succulents instead. “I’ve seen blends of shrubs that bloom in spring and ornamental grasses,” Ms. Brenzel said. “They catch the sunlight in their wispy blades.” Ms. Brenzel, who has a native plant garden at her house, featured a section on drought landscaping in the “Sunset Western Garden Book of Landscaping,” out last month, which she edited. “Streamscaping,” one of the techniques the book spotlights, is a favorite of Christine Watten, a designer at Hill and Dale Landscapes, the firm that converted Ms. Muñoz’s yard. “We do a lot of dry stream beds with rock,” Ms. Watten said. “It’s like an Arroyo Seco look. It gives dimensionality to the garden, focal points.” Advertisement Ms. Watten also likes native ground covers like coast buckwheats and low-growing manzanitas, which have an expansive green look. What’s happening as a result of the water shortage, Ms. Brenzel said, “is that front lawns are getting more interesting, and saving water at the same time.” • How interesting front yards become, however, depends largely on what is seen as acceptable landscaping. And even in the midst of a drought of biblical proportions, longstanding ideas hold sway. Advertisement When Cory Wechsler and her partner, Alicia Gilbreath, decided to start a water-saving competition in their Oakland neighborhood, announcing in an email last month that “a brown lawn is the new cool,” they were surprised by the reaction. The couple had led by example: in the front yard of their duplex they planted a vegetable garden and fruit trees, and added another vegetable patch and a chicken coop in the back. What grass remained had gone unwatered for more than a year. “You just have this brown piece of land,” Ms. Wechsler said. “With a little rain, it’s almost as green as anyone else’s lawn.” But their neighbors showed little enthusiasm for letting their own lawns go brown, she said. “Instead of getting excited, people felt like we were attacking their green lawns,” she said. “I do think people place value in the idea that something is healthy when it’s green, and when it’s brown, it’s not so.” The couple have since reframed the competition, downplaying the brown-lawn aspect and focusing instead on other ways of decreasing water use, from installing a gray-water system to planting drought-tolerant flowers and herbs like rosemary. “There’s no judgment,” Ms. Wechsler said. “Let’s just talk about the decisions each of us are willing to make.” • Soon, though, homeowners with a traditional green lawn may not have a choice. An average of 50 to 60 percent of a household’s water consumption goes to outdoor use, which includes the landscape, said Mr. Ingels, the horticulture adviser. He envisions a future in which lawns go dormant in winter, and possibly even in summer, if watering is not allowed. “The water bills are going up,” Mr. Ingels said. “I think we’re going to start seeing more and more people opt for a brown lawn. I think it could become more traditional.” In Southern California, where water reserves are in (marginally) greater supply than in the northern part of the state, many homeowners have not yet reached a lawn reckoning, said Peter Eberhard, a designer with the Los Angeles firm GDS Designs. Advertisement “We’re not at that point in the ’70s when people are draining their pools and in panic mode,” Mr. Eberhard said. “The trend here is about reducing the size of the lawn.” He has torn up plenty of grass in the last few years, but that was motivated less by his clients’ desire to conserve water, he said, than their requests for “outdoor rooms” focused around barbecue pits, kitchens and entertaining areas.   “People want to use their outside areas as an exterior house,” he said. “That’s a huge feature in almost every house we do now.” Tine Nilsen wanted a similar kind of hardscape at her house in the Mar Vista section of Los Angeles, and over a year ago hired Mr. Eberhard’s firm. But she was concerned that removing the grass would create a barren-looking landscape. “I wanted a modern feel and low maintenance,” Ms. Nilsen said. “What I didn’t want was for it to feel very desert-y.” Mr. Eberhard used granite and mulch with new hedging and minimal low-water plants in the backyard, and in the front yard planted beds of succulents that are hand-watered periodically and native low-water shrubs, along with a few trees. “The little bushes are very lush and green,” Ms. Nilsen said. “But not so heavy that they cover everything.” And her new landscaping, which is fed by a drip irrigation system, consumes a quarter of the water her lawn did, she said. Despite the drought, few people in Ms. Nilsen’s neighborhood have followed suit. Not yet, anyway. Californians have a complicated, ambivalent relationship with water and, like much of the rest of America, a deep-seated allegiance to their grass lawns. If Ms. Nilsen needs any proof of that, all she has to do is step outside in the morning and look up and down her street, where the sprinklers are all working furiously at keeping her neighbors’ grass green. ■ Going Brown With summer on its way, and tighter water restrictions likely, more Californians may soon decide that grass isn’t green enough, and opt instead for a different kind of landscape. Here are a few basics for installing a drought-tolerant garden. Advertisement WHEN TO UPROOT Even drought-tolerant plants require water to get established. If there is mandatory rationing, it may be best to let the lawn go brown and wait until fall, said Kathleen Brenzel, garden editor of Sunset magazine. Putting down newspaper around the edges and topping it with mulch will kill the lawn after three to four months. “That’s a summer project, something you can do to prep for fall,” Ms. Brenzel said. COST To replace grass with drought-tolerant plants and inexpensive hardscaping usually runs $10 to $12 a square foot, said Tim Hill, an owner of Hill and Dale Landscapes in Monterey, Calif. More-elaborate plantings or masonry work will raise the price. Mr. Hill suggested avoiding the “instant look” and planting less. It may take a few years for the yard to fill out, but it will bring costs down. Synthetic grass is another option. Marianna Mori, of the Seaside Garden Center on the Monterey Peninsula, said her company charges $14 a square foot, which includes installation. MAINTENANCE The amount of watering required should be significantly reduced — to one to three days a week, maximum, for drought-tolerant or native plants, down from three to four days a week for a typical lawn, said Peter Eberhard of GDS Designs in Los Angeles. And “it can even be less depending on the plant selection,” he said. An article last Thursday about homeowners in California who are switching away from traditional lawns because of a continuing drought described incorrectly Hill and Dale, which installed drought-resistant plants for a homeowner. It is a landscaping company, not a landscape architecture firm. A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2014, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Brown Is the New Green.

Science   To Keep Teenagers Alert, Schools Let Them Sleep In Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   COLUMBIA, Mo. – Jilly Dos Santos really did try to get to school on time. She set three successive alarms on her phone. Skipped breakfast. Hastily applied makeup while her fuming father drove. But last year she rarely made it into the frantic scrum at the doors of Rock Bridge High School here by the first bell, at 7:50 a.m. Then she heard that the school board was about to make the day start even earlier, at 7:20 a.m. “I thought, if that happens, I will die,” recalled Jilly, 17. “I will drop out of school!” That was when the sleep-deprived teenager turned into a sleep activist. She was determined to convince the board of a truth she knew in the core of her tired, lanky body: Teenagers are developmentally driven to be late to bed, late to rise. Could the board realign the first bell with that biological reality? The sputtering, nearly 20-year movement to start high schools later has recently gained momentum in communities like this one, as hundreds of schools in dozens of districts across the country have bowed to the accumulating research on the adolescent body clock. In just the last two years, high schools in Long Beach, Calif.; Stillwater, Okla.; Decatur, Ga.;, and Glens Falls, N.Y., have pushed back their first bells, joining early adopters in Connecticut, North Carolina, Kentucky and Minnesota. The Seattle school board will vote this month on whether to pursue the issue. The superintendent of Montgomery County, Md., supports the shift, and the school board for Fairfax County, Va., is working with consultants to develop options for starts after 8 a.m. New evidence suggests that later high school starts have widespread benefits. Researchers at the University of Minnesota, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, studied eight high schools in three states before and after they moved to later start times in recent years. In results released Wednesday they found that the later a school’s start time, the better off the students were on many measures, including mental health, car crash rates, attendance and, in some schools, grades and standardized test scores. Dr. Elizabeth Miller, chief of adolescent medicine at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the research, noted that the study was not a randomized controlled trial, which would have compared schools that had changed times with similar schools that had not. But she said its methods were pragmatic and its findings promising. “Even schools with limited resources can make this one policy change with what appears to be benefits for their students,” Dr. Miller said. Researchers have found that during adolescence, as hormones surge and the brain develops, teenagers who regularly sleep eight to nine hours a night learn better and are less likely to be tardy, get in fights or sustain athletic injuries. Sleeping well can also help moderate their tendency toward impulsive or risky decision-making. During puberty, teenagers have a later release of the “sleep” hormone melatonin, which means they tend not to feel drowsy until around 11 p.m. That inclination can be further delayed by the stimulating blue light from electronic devices, which tricks the brain into sensing wakeful daylight, slowing the release of melatonin and the onset of sleep. The Minnesota study noted that 88 percent of the students kept a cellphone in their bedroom. But many parents, and some students, object to shifting the start of the day later. They say doing so makes sports practices end late, jeopardizes student jobs, bites into time for homework and extracurricular activities, and upsets the morning routine for working parents and younger children. At heart, though, experts say, the resistance is driven by skepticism about the primacy of sleep. “It’s still a badge of honor to get five hours of sleep,” said Dr. Judith Owens, a sleep expert at the Children’s National Medical Center in Washington. “It supposedly means you’re working harder, and that’s a good thing. So there has to be a cultural shift around sleep.” Last January, Jilly decided she would try to make that change happen in the Columbia school district, which sprawls across 300 square miles of flatland, with 18,000 students and 458 bus routes. But before she could make the case for a later bell, she had to show why an earlier one just would not do. She got the idea in her team-taught Advanced Placement world history class, which explores the role of leadership. Students were urged to find a contemporary topic that ignited their passion. One morning, the teachers mentioned that a school board committee had recommended an earlier start time to solve logistical problems in scheduling bus routes. The issue would be discussed at a school board hearing in five days. If you do not like it, the teachers said, do something. Jilly did the ugly math: A first bell at 7:20 a.m. meant she would have to wake up at 6 a.m. She had found her passion. She seemed an unlikely choice to halt what was almost a done deal. She was just a sophomore, and did not particularly relish conflict. But Jilly, the youngest of seven children, had learned to be independent early on: Her mother died when she was 9. And she is energetic and forthright. That year, she had interned on a voter turnout drive for Missouri Democrats, volunteered in a French-immersion prekindergarten class, written for the student newspaper, worked at a fast-food pizza restaurant and maintained an A average in French, Spanish and Latin. “It’s about time management,” she explained one recent afternoon, curled up in an armchair at home. That Wednesday, she pulled an all-nighter. She created a Facebook page and set up a Twitter account, alerting hundreds of students about the school board meeting: “Be there to have a say in your school district’s decisions on school start times!” She then got in touch with Start School Later, a nonprofit group that provided her with scientific ammunition. She recruited friends and divided up sleep-research topics. With a blast of emails, she tried to enlist the help of every high school teacher in the district. She started an online petition. The students she organized made hundreds of posters and fliers, and posted advice on Twitter: “If you are going to be attending the board meeting tomorrow we recommend that you dress up!” The testy school board meeting that Monday was packed. Jilly, wearing a demure, ruffled white blouse and skirt, addressed the board, blinking owl-like. The dignitaries’ faces were a blur to her because while nervously rubbing her eyes, she had removed her contact lenses. But she spoke coolly about the adolescent sleep cycle: “You know, kids don’t want to get up,” she said. “I know I don’t. Biologically, we’ve looked into that.” The board heatedly debated the issue and decided against the earlier start time. The next day Jilly turned to campaigning for a later start time, joining a movement that has been gaining support. A 2011 report by the Brookings Institution recommended later start times for high schools, and last summer Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, posted his endorsement of the idea on Twitter.   Should high schools adjust their start times out of concern for students’ health? How would any changes impact your family’s schedule? Join in the discussion.    The University of Minnesota study tracked 9,000 high school students in five districts in Colorado, Wyoming and Minnesota before and after schools shifted start times. In those that originally started at 7:30 a.m., only a third of students said they were able to get eight or more hours of sleep. Students who got less than that reported significantly more symptoms of depression, and greater use of caffeine, alcohol and illegal drugs than better-rested peers. “It’s biological — the mental health outcomes were identical from inner-city kids and affluent kids,” said Kyla Wahlstrom, a professor of educational research at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the study. In schools that now start at 8:35 a.m., nearly 60 percent of students reported getting eight hours of sleep nightly. In 2012, the high school in Jackson, Wyo., moved the first bell to 8:55 a.m. from 7:35 a.m. During that academic year, car crashes by drivers 16 to 18 years old dropped to seven from 23 the year before. Academic results improved, though not across the board. After high schools in the South Washington County district, outside Minneapolis, switched to an 8:35 a.m. start, grades in some first- and third-period classes rose between half a point and a full grade point. And the study found that composite scores on national tests such as the ACT rose significantly in two of the five districts. Many researchers say that quality sleep directly affects learning because people store new facts during deep-sleep cycles. During the rapid-eye-movement phases, the brain is wildly active, sorting and categorizing the day’s data. The more sleep a teenager gets, the better the information is absorbed. “Without enough sleep,” said Jessica Payne, a sleep researcher and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, “teenagers are losing the ability not only to solidify information but to transform and restructure it, extracting inferences and insights into problems.” Last February, the school board in Columbia met to consider later start times. “It is really reassuring to know that students can have a say in the matter,” Jilly told them. “So thank you, guys, for that.” The moment of decision arrived at the board’s next meeting in March. Jilly sat in the front row, posting on Twitter, and addressed the board one last time. “I know it’s not the most conventional thing and it’s going to get some pushback,” she said, referring to the later time. “But it is the right decision.” The board voted, 6 to 1, to push back the high school start time to 9 a.m. “Jilly kicked it over the edge for us,” said Chris Belcher, the superintendent. It is now seven months into the new normal. At Rock Bridge High School, the later end to the day, at 4:05 p.m., is problematic for some, including athletes who often miss the last period to make their away games. “After doing homework, it gets to be 11:30 p.m. pretty quickly,” said Brayden Parker, a senior varsity football player. “I would prefer to get home by dark and have more time to chill out.” The high schools in the district have tried to adjust, for example by adding Wi-Fi access to buses so athletes can do homework on the road. Some classes meet only one or two days a week, and are supplemented with online instruction. More sports practices and clubs convene before school. Some parents and first-period teachers are seeing a payoff in students who are more rested and alert. At 7:45 a.m. on a recent school day, Rock Bridge High, a long, one-story building with skylights and wide hallways, was sun-drenched and almost silent. Then, like an orchestra tuning up, students gradually started arriving, some for debate club and choir, others to meet in the cafeteria for breakfast and gossip. Laughter crackled across the lobby, as buses dropped off more students, and others drifted in from the parking lots. The growing crowds could almost be described as civilized. At 8:53 a.m., Jilly burst through the north entrance door, long hair uncombed and flyaway, wearing no makeup, lugging her backpack. “Even when I am late to school now,” she said, dashing down a corridor to make that 8:55 bell, “it’s only by three or four minutes.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/14/2014, on page A1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: To Keep Teenagers Alert, Schools Start to Let Them Sleep In.

Travel   A Wow of a Water Slide. Advertisement Hold on to your bikini straps. Schlitterbahn, the Texas water park company, is opening its newest location in Kansas City, Kan., this spring, featuring what it claims will be the tallest and fastest water slide in the world. Although the slide’s exact height has not yet been revealed, the company has made statements claiming that Verrückt, which means “insane” in German, is taller than the Statue of Liberty, toes to torch, and that it is sure to surpass the current record holder, Beach Park’s “Insano” in Fortaleza, Brazil, which drops riders 135 feet at speeds up to 65 miles per hour. Verrückt requires the use of a four-person raft, which, after the initial drop, estimated to be 17 stories, will be propelled up another five-story hill before the final plunge. A net tunnel will cover parts of the slide, including the initial drop, for safety reasons. “We have always been family friendly, but this will attract those adrenaline junkies who are always looking for that next biggest, coolest thrill,” Layne Pitcher, Schlitterbahn’s director of marketing and sales, told The Kansas City Star.

Business   Song of Exultation. Advertisement By Ed Sessa Mar 15, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Ladles and gentlemints, we have a winner. Ed Sessa has actually included a pop culture/social media reference in his puzzle that I didn’t know. Do you know how hard that is? It’s my job to stay current on these things, but somehow the concept of TWITTER JAIL has eluded me thus far. Maybe it’s because I am way too verbose for Twitter, which limits users to 140 characters a tweet (I exceed that when ordering lunch). Apparently, you get put in TWITTER JAIL if you send out more than 100 tweets an hour or more than 1,000 tweets a day. While you can still see what others are posting, your ability to continue posting is curtailed until such time as you promise to go outside and get some sun already. Anyway, I thought Mr. Sessa’s puzzle was loads of fun, and challenging to boot. KISSYFACE! Clued as “Indication that one wants to get smacked.” I love that. And that’s crossed by the beautiful word ELYSIAN, which as far as I’m concerned, is outstanding in its field. I also loved BANANA PEEL, TIP JAR, BODACIOUS, BRAIN FREEZE, HUMAN RACE and APPLE SAUCE. What fun. And the cluing is pretty awesome, too. “Swiss bank depositor” is a grand misdirection; instead of banking, we need to think about the river AARE. “Uplifting company” is a hint about the OTIS Elevator Company. “A lot of the time?” is definitely EONS. “Less likely to have waffles” is a great clue for SURER. There’s more, but I’ll leave you to discover them on your own. Let’s chat with Mr. Sessa: With this puzzle there were four “seed” words which I wanted to keep if possible, one in each section: HOLMESIAN, leading off the puzzle in the NW, reminded me of the similarly eponymous KAFKAESQUE which had been used in the Los Angeles Times, BRAINFREEZE in the NE which would allow for a clue take-off on “cold comfort,” BODACIOUS in the SE, a portmanteau word (“bold” and “audacious”), and TWITTER JAIL in the SW. I wasn’t sure this last entry would fly, and the puzzle was only provisionally accepted last June, as Will said he wanted to see if the phrase had “staying power.” I hope solvers have some challenges and fun with this one. So, yes, I really enjoyed this one and I learned how to stay out of TWITTER JAIL. What more could you want from your Saturday puzzle? Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Politics   Mitch McConnell Is Not as Vulnerable as He Seems. Advertisement Advertisement By NATE COHNMARCH 13, 2014 WASHINGTON — It has been a dreadful winter for Democrats as red state incumbents struggle to overcome President Obama’s sagging popularity. But there’s one person in particular Democrats still hope to beat: Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Polls say Mr. McConnell is locked in a dead heat for re-election in Kentucky. Some surveys even show him trailing Alison Lundergan Grimes, his Democratic challenger. But the polls overstate his vulnerability. A McConnell defeat would be all but unprecedented. Mr. McConnell is not only an incumbent senator who represents the party opposed to the White House in a midterm election, but he also comes from a state that opposes the president. Since 1956, only seven senators in these circumstances have lost re-election. The last time was in 1998, when John Edwards defeated Senator Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina. But 2014 is not 1998. Back then, President Bill Clinton’s approval rating was in the mid-60s. Today, President Obama’s ratings are mired in the low 40s. Kentucky is also not North Carolina, which only narrowly voted against Mr. Clinton. Kentucky is an extremely favorable state for a Republican candidate: It voted for Romney and McCain by an average of 25 points to the right of the country. Senate incumbents rarely lose on friendly territory. When they have lost, the state was usually less solidly partisan than what Sen. Mitch McConnell faces in Kentucky. Below, the list of incumbents who have lost in friendly territory when the president represents the opposite party. STATES WHERE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENTS LOST Sen. McConnell’s Kentucky, 2014 PCT. POINTS TO THE RIGHT OF THE COUNTRY IN THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS STATE YEAR INCUMBENT North Carolina South Dakota Indiana Wisconsin South Dakota 1998 1962 1962 1962 1996 Lauch Faircloth Joseph Bottum Homer E. Capehart Alexander Wiley Larry Pressler +25 pts. 10 15 +20 pts. STATES WHERE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENTS LOST PCT. POINTS TO THE LEFT OF THE COUNTRY IN THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS STATE YEAR INCUMBENT Kentucky Connecticut Kentucky Delaware Maryland California 1956 1970 1984 1960 1970 1976 Earle Clements Thomas J. Dodd Walter D. Huddleston J. Allen Frear, Jr. Joseph D. Tydings John V. Tunney 5 10 15 +20 pts. From that perspective, there is no precedent for a McConnell defeat. No senator has lost in a state as favorable as Kentucky when the president represents the other party. And it’s not even close: North Carolina, it turns out, is the closest example. States with serious reservations about the incumbent president seem unwilling to dismiss the president’s opponents in the Senate. Very few incumbent senators lose re-election in states as favorable as Kentucky, period. Since 1956, only one incumbent senator has lost re-election in a state more favorable than Kentucky under any circumstance. That senator was Ted Stevens, who was convicted on seven counts of corruption just one week before the 2008 election, in a tough year for Republicans. Despite all of that, he lost by only one percentage point. He is the exception that seems to prove the rule. Advertisement Mr. McConnell, of course, is not a convicted felon. And unlike Mr. Stevens, Mr. McConnell comfortably won re-election in worst-case circumstances in 2008, just one month after shepherding TARP, the bank bailout package, to passage in the Senate. Since then, Mr. Obama has alienated eastern Kentucky’s coal country, traditionally the most Democratic-leaning stretch of the state. Without those voters, it is unclear whether there’s still a path to victory for Democrats seeking federal office. Yet the polls show a close race. So long as that’s true, Ms. Grimes can’t be counted out. Still, most surveys show Ms. Grimes, Kentucky’s secretary of state, polling in the low-to-mid 40s. That’s not bad, but each of the last three Democratic Senate candidates in Kentucky reached 44 percent of the vote. To win, Ms. Grimes needs to make inroads into Kentucky’s Republican-leaning voters, and, so far, it hasn’t happened. Campaigns tend to move partisans toward their respective corners. Campaign advertisements, messages, and even gaffes, emphasize the ideological differences between the candidates and polarize voters along party lines. Mr. McConnell will spend the next eight months reminding voters that he’s the president’s most reliable adversary, and that control of the Senate is at stake. That message seems likely to resonate with Kentucky’s anti-Obama electorate.

Science   Mammography’s Limits, Seldom Understood. Advertisement A sad fact: None of the eight major clinical trials looking at whether regular mammograms reduce a woman’s risk of dying from breast cancer has included women over age 75. Older adults are frequently excluded from trials, a problem for those trying to treat them based on information, not hunches. This helps explain why the United States Preventive Services Task Force says the current evidence is “insufficient” to assess mammography’s value for those over age 75, and why the American Geriatrics Society cautions against it for women with limited life expectancies. Not only may mammograms not help, like any medical procedure, they may also harm. Mammograms can result in false positives that require additional tests, including biopsies, and bring anxiety. The scans may identify small tumors that wouldn’t have caused problems for years — or at all, since older women are far more likely to die from other causes. Yet once a mammogram detects even a non-invasive cancer, “it’s very hard to decide not to be treated,” said Dr. Mara Schonberg, an internist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Since most women over age 75 still get mammograms, thousands of them undergo unnecessary surgery, radiation and medication every year. What women need, she and several colleagues agreed, is a “decision aid,” a tool that clarifies a medical procedure and its likely results. Once they understand the pros and cons of mammograms, “women can make better decisions based on realistic information about their risks,” she said. Dr. Schonberg, who has investigated breast cancer screening among older women for years, noted that women don’t hear much about the cons.  She and her colleagues decided to put together an 11-page pamphlet, written clearly at a sixth-grade reading level. It points out that doctors don’t know whether mammograms lower mortality in this age group. (Indeed, there is wide disagreement over whether regular mammograms lower mortality in any age group.) The guide estimates that out of 1,000 women over 75, three of those who get mammograms will die of breast cancer and so will four of those who don’t, a tiny difference. Its charts show that heart disease, other cancers, stroke and dementia are far greater threats to elderly women. It even helps women calculate their life expectancy, to see whether a mammogram is likely to extend their lives. Then the researchers tried a small pilot study, asking 45 women aged 75 to 89 who’d had a mammogram within two years to use the pamphlet. Did it help? Maybe. Sort of. Yes, the information did significantly improve their knowledge, results published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine show. The women scored higher on a true-false test about the benefits and risks of breast cancer screening after they read the pamphlet than they had beforehand. Yes, it did lead to more conversations about the decision with primary care doctors: In the five years before this experiment, patient medical records showed, only 11 percent had had such discussions. In the six months after reading the guide, 53 percent did. And yes, the proportion of this small group who intended to continue screening dropped substantially, especially among those with a calculated life expectancy of nine years or less. In that group, 85 percent had earlier said they intended to get another mammogram; after the guide, 50 percent did. The guide didn’t make a significant difference in the group with a longer life expectancy. Women said they liked the pamphlet and found it useful. Their doctors said so, too. And yet 60 percent of these older women went ahead and got another mammogram within 15 months, including more than half of those with a lower life expectancy. It was tough to persuade women to start getting regular mammograms back in the 1970s, when the American Cancer Society and the former first lady Betty Ford began campaigning for annual screening. Decades later, it’s tough to get older women to stop. Ditto for other cancer screenings — Pap tests, prostate tests, colonoscopies —among both older men and women. These decisions involve more than a risk/reward calculation, clearly. When it comes to mammograms, “women go for reassurance, for affirmation of their health,” Dr. Schonberg said. Her own studies show that “they felt this was the responsible thing to do,” what Dr. Alexia Torke, associate director of the Indiana University Center for Aging Research, has termed “a moral obligation.” Some women don’t recognize that there’s a decision to be made at all. “Radiologists send you an annual reminder card,” Dr. Schonberg said. “You’re just told, ‘go.’” (The Preventive Services Task Force recommendation is every two years, not annually, up to age 74.) Still, this remains an individual decision. Women who see the whole picture and decide to continue with mammograms — Medicare pays for one each year — at least have reached an informed decision. So I hope Dr. Schonberg’s pamphlet gets widely circulated. She’s about to test it with a much larger sample of about 500 women in Massachusetts and North Carolina, then report her findings. And then we’ll publish a link to the guide here, for anyone to use.

Travel   Orient-Express Hotels Gets a New Name. Advertisement Orient-Express Hotels, more than decade old,  and with  45 luxury hotels, as well as trains, safari camps and river cruises in its collection, got a new name this week: The London-based brand is now called Belmond. The purpose of the relaunch, according to president and chief executive John Scott, is to bring more awareness to the group as a single portfolio. (The new name is derived from words for “beautiful” and “world.” ) “When I became C.E.O. in 2012, I realized that travelers associated with our individual properties such as Cipriani in Venice or Copacabana in Rio but didn’t identify with the overall brand,” he said. “We were missing the opportunity for guests to know us as a whole and needed one voice.” The makeover includes new websites for each offering, which have a cleaner and more contemporary look, and, unlike before, when the Orient-Express logo was a small footnote, the Belmond logo will be prominently displayed on the sites’ home pages. Mr. Scott said that the change will be financially advantageous for the company but will also benefit its guests. “We will connect with our customers as a collective and be able to do more to build and manage relationships with them,” he said. Belmond said it has spent $15 million on the initiative, which includes the sites, social media and its first large-scale international advertising campaign in magazines, newspapers and online.

Business   Celebrity Guest Solver Suzanne Whang: It’s Better This Way. Advertisement   By Jeremy Newton Mar 16, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — Well, I don’t have to say very much today, because Suzanne Whang, stand-up comedian, actress and host of HGTV’s “House Hunters” for 10 years, is going to tell you about her experience solving today’s crossword puzzle. More importantly, you know how I always encourage people to talk about what the puzzle brings out for them? You’re going to read a surprising and very touching twist at the end of Ms. Whang’s write-up, and I promise you that neither of us thought of this when I scheduled her for today’s post. That’s all I’m going to say. I’m just glad things are working out for her, because we need more bright lights like her in the world. When my friend Elayne Boosler told me that she was a celebrity guest crossword solver for The New York Times, I plotzed (Koreans are the Jews of Asia.) I blurted out, “You WERE? What exactly does that MEAN? I want to do that!!” I’ve been in love with crossword puzzles for as long as I can remember. And lately, here’s how it works. Every time I get on an airplane from L.A. to New York City, as soon as I get through security, I go straight to the nearest newsstand and I buy USA Today, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and a bottle of water. I head to my gate and then proceed to do what would appear to be an odd ritual to anyone who cares about what’s going on in the world. First, I find the section of each newspaper that has the crossword puzzle. I remove those sections, and I give away the rest. Then I open each section to the page with the crossword puzzle. First, I carefully fold backward at the main vertical seam, then backward at the main horizontal seam, and then I create a new vertical fold so that now all that’s visible is the puzzle itself. Then I put the puzzles in order of increasing difficulty: USA Today, then The Los Angeles Times, then The New York Times. If it’s a Monday, I can sometimes get all three puzzles finished before the plane takes off. If it’s a Saturday, I will most likely not finish the New York Times puzzle by the time I land in New York, and I’m furious that it’s so freakin’ difficult. I use pen. It has to be a Pilot Precise pen, in black, blue or purple. It’s the only pen for me. It gushes with ink. It glides. It makes writing a pleasure. The only problem is that these pens sometimes explode in the airplane, leaking ink everywhere. But I digress. The only exception to my folding ritual is when it’s a Sunday, which means that the holy grail of puzzles is in The New York Times Sunday Magazine. Ahhhh. It’ll be close to the last page. And it’s on smooth magazine paper. And there will be some sort of theme for me to figure out, so it’s a puzzle within a puzzle. And it’s bigger than the other puzzles (21 x 21 instead of 15 x 15). And I love it so. And I don’t want your help until I’ve done everything in my power to solve it on my own. Once, on an airplane, the person sitting next to me just decided to tell me the answer to 7 down. Unsolicited help. Horrifying. I felt so violated, I needed a Silkwood scrub-down. I emailed Deb Amlen, introducing myself, hoping I was enough of a celebrity to be considered for this highest of all honors, pitching myself as if it were more important than anything else I had done in my 25-year show biz career. When I got her email saying that she knew who I was and yes I could be a celebrity guest solver, I squealed with glee. When she gave me a choice of what day of the week I’d like to solve, well, that was easy. Sunday! Most of my friends don’t do crossword puzzles, and they don’t understand my obsession with them. They also don’t understand why I don’t want crossword puzzle books, and I don’t want to do crossword puzzles online. This is a visceral experience that requires pen and paper, and it has to be in a newspaper, not in a book. It’s more special when you’re doing the puzzle in today’s paper. And the puzzles in The New York Times, thanks to Will Shortz, are the most elegant. There is a sweet spot between a clue being too easy and being impossible to figure out, and Mr. Shortz manages to make sure to create that perfect balance. Well, with the exception of Saturdays. Grrr. One of my favorite documentaries is “Wordplay.” Much like a support group meeting, it was wonderful to not feel like such a weirdo for loving crossword puzzles this much. Jon Stewart loves crosswords, too? Yay! When I printed out the Sunday puzzle I’d be solving, the first thing that occurred to me was, “I’m seeing this puzzle before the rest of the world! Wow!” The second thing that occurred to me was, “My father is going to LOVE reading this piece.” I got my father into crossword puzzles many years ago. But I got my love of the English language from him. O.K., let’s get to this puzzle. After wondering about the significance of the title, I notice the four circles in the squares of 1 Across, and the four circles in the squares of 119 Across. What is that? A word within a word? Hmm. I usually begin puzzles by looking through the clues for anything with a fill-in-the-blank. I’m not sure why I do this, but I do. Perhaps in my experience, I’m often able to solve those clues easily. 62 Across, “______ good cheer!” I write in “BE OF.” I write in all capital letters. Not sure why, it’s just what I’ve always done. I wonder why it doesn’t say (two words) in the clue. There was a time when the clues would tell us if the answer was more than one word. I’m mildly annoyed. 117 Across, “The ______ Project” (Fox comedy). MINDY! 2 Down, “______ de la Societe.” I think it’s “ILES”; that’s one of those crossword puzzle answers that I only know from doing crossword puzzles. Like knowing that a jewelry case is an ETUI. 15 Down, “Whack-_____” Well, it’s gotta be “A-MOLE”. 66 Down, “_____ and Thummim (sacred Judaic objects)” Darn you, Jeremy Newton and Will Shortz. Grrrrr. I rarely know world history or ancient terms for anything. Or the Latin words for anything. Now, what’s the theme of this puzzle? 23 Across, “*He bested Leonidas at Thermopylae.” Oh, come ON. Nobody knows that. And why is there an asterisk before the clue? Here are my favorite clues. 1 Down’s “Something dirty kept in a cell?” It took me a while, but I finally realized it was “SEXT.” Fantastic. 57 Down, “Loud beast heard in the theaters”. Huh? Godzilla? King Kong? Those don’t fit. Then I got the across answers that showed me the first two letters of the answer were MG. There’s no word that starts with MG. If it’s a Scottish word, it would be MCG. Then I realize. It’s the MGM LION. Woo hoo! I’m so pleased with myself now. 7 Across, “Touching words?” Eulogy doesn’t fit. And there’s a question mark, so there’s something punny going on. Oh! BRAILLE! Love it. 73 Down: “They’re 18 to 21”. What could that possibly mean? I can’t get past these numbers referring to a person’s age. Then I finally realize it’s referring to the letters of the alphabet. RSTU. I’m in heaven. I get that 31 Across is FOURXFOUR, and that 49 Across is THE WINTERX GAMES, and then I see the clue for 16 Down. It’s the key to this puzzle! In both of these starred clues, the answers contain the letters RX, which means “prescription.” And now I’m on my way. Figuring out the theme to a Sunday puzzle is what I would call a “wordgasm.” As soon as I figure out the theme, I have to leave the house to go to a meeting. I’m in my car, and I notice this license plate right in front of me. PARIS RX. I get chills. I recently married a man whom I’ve been friends with and secretly in love with for 20 years. Turns out he was secretly in love with me, too, and he chose to tell me. We want to go on a honeymoon to Paris, when we can afford it. And then RX, the theme of this puzzle is right after that? Paris prescription, indeed. I get that 1 Across is SICK OF, with SICK being inside the four circles, so I look at the four circles at the bottom right and wonder if those would contain the letters WELL. The clue is “Thrive,” so I write in “DOWELL.” Now the title makes sense. “IT’S BETTER THIS WAY.” We begin with SICK and end with WELL. This theme is poignant for me. In the last eight years, I had breast cancer three times, because like most Asians, I am an overachiever. Yay! The third time it metastasized to Stage 4, and I was given six months to live. But I reversed the disease, reclaimed my health, and am now cancer-free. I used Western medicine, Eastern medicine, holistic, alternative, illegal and revolutionary treatments. I came out of the cancer closet and started asking for (and receiving) help and love. My house became Grand Central Love Station. I felt like Jimmy Stewart at the end of “It’s a Wonderful Life.” I changed my nutrition and started meditating. And now I laugh, I bask in the present moment, and I overflow with gratitude. Every day feels like a bonus round. I wake up so grateful to be alive. I’m not just a survivor, I’m a thriver. And that today I get to be the celebrity guest solver for the New York Times Sunday puzzle is yet another miracle. The only thing that could top this would be for my name to be the answer to a New York Times crossword puzzle clue. In a random house in America: “Hey, sweetie, what’s a 12-letter-word for a crazy Asian?” Wow. That blew me away. Let it never be said that crossword puzzles don’t evoke strong emotions in people. Let’s catch up with the constructor, Jeremy Newton: A puzzle featuring “Rx” as the theme has been a personal constructor vendetta for me. Maybe it’s the lure of the Scrabbly X, or the excitement of getting a theme out that I haven’t seen before, or some unhealthy deep-seated obsession with prescription drugs. My first RX-related submission to The Times was a 15×15 rebus-style puzzle, the second a 21×21 rebus. Both had not enough theme material and some really strained theme entries (Example: RxKBP clued as a chess move. Yikes). Two rejection letters later, I submitted a 15×15 with entries containing RX in the very middle (COLORXEROX, DEERXING, etc), but Will Shortz found it not quite interesting enough. Next, I toyed with a diagonal offset of R/X in the grid. To represent how “Rx” is often hand written or how it traditionally appears on drugstore signs. The horizontal theme entries dropped down one row at the X, then continued along their way. While sort of a neat trick (and “Medicine Dropper” was screaming to be the puzzle title), I thought this gimmick would be too arbitrary for some, and probably too easy to find the R/X locations for other solvers. My final attempt at the RX theme (today’s puzzle) was inspired by the phrase “follow the prescription.” This felt “in the language” enough, and it seemed like a great start for a puzzle directive / theme revealer. From there, I needed something to drive the solver to follow “RX” pairs across the grid. Going from SICK to WELL seemed an appropriate solution. In the end, I was able to wrangle the theme answers into a fairly straight, easy-to-follow RX conga line. As luck would have it (thank you, Crossword Gods), the revealer FOLLOWING THE / PRESCRIPTION found a home in opposite corners by crossing nicely with my center entry, GROUCHO MARX MUSTACHE. I’m superpleased how the hidden trail of RXs turned out. And I’m relieved that my RX vendetta is over. As are we, Mr. Newton. Mr. Newton has a game coming out in two weeks for iPhone and iPad called “Cross Wars” that is free to download and was made with help from his colleagues at Team Chaos. Your thoughts?

Foreign   U.S. Navy Strategists Have a Long History of Finding the Lost. Advertisement Advertisement By BENEDICT CAREYMARCH 14, 2014 The uncertainties surrounding Malaysia Airlines Flight 370’s disappearance are enormous, but naval strategists have been unraveling lost-at-sea mysteries as far back as the U-boat battles of World War II, and perhaps most dramatically in 1968, when an intelligence team found the submarine Scorpion, which sank in the North Atlantic after losing contact under equally baffling circumstances. A United States Navy spokeswoman said that its involvement in the search so far has been in response to requests by the Malaysian government. The destroyer Kidd is patrolling west of the Strait of Malacca, and a P-8 search plane arrived in the area on Friday, but no submarines were involved, she said. Yet it is the Office of Naval Intelligence — and particularly the submarine division — that has refined some of the most creative techniques for finding sunken ships, spent warheads and downed pilots in vast, uncharted waters. Those techniques are now integral to forecasting by the intelligence community, economic prognosticators and the armed services, and will come into play if the Navy is asked to take a central role in the search for Flight 370. “The same approach we used with Scorpion could be applied in this case and should be,” John P. Craven, the former Navy scientist credited with finding the Scorpion, said in a telephone interview. “But you need to begin with the right people.” Advertisement The approach is a kind of crowdsourcing, but not one in which volunteers pored over satellite images, like they have in search of Flight 370. That effort is akin to good Samaritans combing a forest for a lost child without knowing for certain that the child is there. Instead, forecasters draw on expertise from diverse but relevant areas — in the case of finding a submarine, say, submarine command, ocean salvage, and oceanography experts, as well as physicists and engineers. Each would make an educated guess as to where the ship is, based on different scenarios: the sub was attacked; a torpedo activated onboard; a battery exploded. This is how Dr. Craven located the Scorpion. “I knew these guys and I gave probability scores to each scenario they came up with,” Dr. Craven said. The men bet bottles of Chivas Regal to keep matters interesting, and after some statistical analysis, Dr. Craven zeroed in on a point about 400 miles from the Azores, near the Sargasso Sea, according to a detailed account in “Blind Man’s Bluff,” by Christopher Drew and Sherry Sontag. The sub was found about 200 yards away. The idea behind such pooled forecasting is that each person offers a small bit of insight and that those “weak signals from diverse experts accumulate quickly,” said Philip E. Tetlock, a professor of management at the Wharton School who works with the Office of the director of National Intelligence on the Good Judgment Project, which tests forecasts of geopolitical events. In the case of the downed plane, forecasters might bring in climate and ocean scientists, engineers who worked on building the plane’s components and commercial pilots familiar with the route. Those specialists would then make judgments based on the scenarios already discussed as possible causes for the disappearance of Flight 370: terrorism, pilot error, sudden depressurization and engine failure. The experts are sometimes grouped in teams, whose prognostications are then weighted according to factors, such as how up-to-date their information is and how solid their previous track records are, said Lyle H. Ungar, a professor in the department of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania, who works on the forecasts. “We do a lot of this pooled forecasting and it works pretty well, sometimes spookily well,” Dr. Tetlock said. Sound-detection technology in and around the Indian Ocean may aid this forecasting — or render it moot, other experts said. The Chinese may already have sound-detection equipment in waters nearby. And any submarine in those waters — Chinese, American or otherwise — would be equipped with sound surveillance systems that could pick up the signature of a fallen plane, even many miles off, said Alfred Scott McLaren, a former submarine commander who has mapped Arctic waters, including the Siberian Shelf. Dr. McLaren said that the area where the Malaysian plane seems to have gone down lies amid “a cluster of potential global rivals” and that the sound of the airliner’s fall — if it hit the water — might already have been picked up by submarines watching each other. “In that case the information would be classified,” he said, “and we wouldn’t know anything until it was released through back channels somehow.” Walter Munk, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said that with international cooperation the technology exists to track almost any airliner that falls into open ocean, but the system needs to be in place before an incident. The Atlantic and Pacific are somewhat covered, but places like the Andaman Sea and the Indian Ocean are much less so. “I think you could put detection systems in about twelve places in the world, chosen carefully,” Dr. Munk said, “and then we would be much better prepared to find the next downed airplane that seemed to disappear.” A version of this article appears in print on March 15, 2014, on page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Navy Strategists Have a Long History of Finding the Lost.

Travel   Brand Placement Moves to the High Seas. Advertisement If your cruise ship makes you feel more at home than ever, it’s not just the comfortable cabins. The expansion of familiar brands on the high seas is showcasing American pop culture. Cartoon characters are a staple of many family-focused ships, including the new 4,028-passenger Norwegian Getaway that launched this year with a Nickelodeon-themed water park headlined by SpongeBob SquarePants. Last week, the Cat in the Hat, Sam-I-Am and other Dr. Seuss characters were aboard the 4,914-passenger Carnival Splendor. The new Dr. Seuss program includes a Green Eggs and Ham Breakfast, storytelling time and a character parade on each cruise. The line plans to expand its Seuss programs to all 24 ships by next year. For music lovers, Holland America Line is in the midst of expanding its B. B. King’s Blues Club from one ship to five. The B. B. King Blues Club Bands play in one of the ships’ lounges on a special stage modeled on the original Memphis club five nights each week aboard the Westerdam, Noordam and Zuiderdam, and is coming soon to the Eurodam and Nieuw Amsterdam. On the high end of partnerships, Celebrity Cruises links with the destination spa Canyon Ranch to offer SpaClub at Sea on 10 of its 11 ships by April 14. Its new shipboard treatment menu will include Reiki energy therapy, Pilates, acupuncture and chiropractic therapy. Frequent cruisers might already by acquainted with the spa; Canyon Ranch operates on Cunard, Oceania and Regent Seven Seas ships.

Business   Giant Interactive, a Chinese Web Video Game Operator, Agrees to $3 Billion Buyout. Advertisement   The buyout of Giant, which is based in Shanghai and listed in New York, ranks as the second-biggest such “take-private” deal for a Chinese company after the $3.8 billion privatization of Focus Media, which was delisted from the Nasdaq after being acquired last May by its chairman and a consortium of private equity companies. Giant on Monday accepted the leveraged buyout offer from its chairman, Shi Yuzhu, Baring Private Equity Asia and Hony Capital of China after the group raised its bid to $12 per share, up from the $11.75 per share originally offered in November. The buyers already controlled a 47 percent stake in the company and have lined up debt financing of $850 million, slightly more than half of the $1.6 billion they will need to pay for the shares they do not already own. While a new wave of Chinese Internet companies is lining up to sell shares in the United States — led by companies like the e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba and the Sina Corporation’s Weibo microblog unit — a group of companies that conducted American initial public offerings years ago is in the process of delisting. In many cases, these take-private deals are the result of slumping share prices that came after a spate of short-seller attacks on American-listed Chinese companies in recent years. Private equity companies have often teamed up with management to help bankroll the buyout bids. Giant, which develops and operates a number of popular multiplayer online games in China, raised almost $900 million when it listed in New York in 2007. In going private, Giant is following another major Chinese online game company, Shanda Interactive Entertainment, which was delisted from the Nasdaq in 2012 by its chairman in a deal that valued it at $2.3 billion. Giant’s board, which unanimously supported the buyout, was advised by Morgan Stanley. The buyers were advised by China Minsheng Bank, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, ICBC International Capital and JPMorgan Chase; those banks are also arranging debt financing for the buyout.

Foreign   In Varanasi, a Lifetime Spent in a World of Death. Advertisement VARANASI, India — In India’s oldest city, the only female gatekeeper of heaven sits in her homespun sari and tends to an open oven in a 14th-century building near the sacred Ganges River. In a city where Hindus come to die, Yamuna Devi, a member of the Dom, a century-old untouchable caste that handles cremation, oversees the earthly end of a Hindu’s spiritual journey. Ms. Devi, 65, is the keeper of the sacred fire at Manikarnika Ghat, the holiest crematorium for Hindus, who believe a cremation at Manikarnika prevents rebirth, ensuring entry into heaven. She contends that her oven has been been lighted for centuries, containing what she calls the eternal flame, without which the funeral pyres cannot be lighted. Everyone around her calls her a funeral director, a job she inherited from her husband, who died three decades ago. When Doms die, usually another male family member takes over the business of the final rites, but Ms. Devi decided to take on her husband’s work to support her two young sons. “My life is to live in a world of death,” Ms. Devi said in an interview earlier this month, sitting on a torn mat in a courtyard filled with smoke and surrounded by walls coated with soot accumulated over decades. She spends more than 10 hours daily at the ghat, or bathing place near a river, in Manikarnika. An estimated 100 bodies are cremated daily at Manikarnika, where a pyre burns 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Across Varanasi, nearly 200 bodies are burned every day. Manikarnika, which in regional Sanskrit means “earrings,” is an important place of worship for the Shaktism sect of Hinduism. One Hindu tradition says the ghat was formed when the ear jewel from Lord Shiva fell on the earth while he was dancing angrily. Doms are normally found near Manikarnika Ghat and Raja Harishchandra Ghat, the two most important crematoriums in Varanasi. It is imperative for those who bring their dead to cremate in Manikarnika to take a flaming bunch of hay from the oven Ms. Devi oversees. Nearby, a frail Hindu farmer, Ashok Singh, took a bit of fire from Ms. Devi’s oven, paid his fee and walked to light the pyre under his father. Mr. Singh, who is from Allahabad, about 75 miles from Varanasi, made the trip so that the soul of his father would go to heaven. “I traveled for four hours to reach Manikarnika to fulfill my father’s last wish,” Mr. Singh said. Every day, Ms. Devi makes sure to walk around the fire five times to honor the five elements — fire, water, earth, air and ether — as part of a Hindu custom to ensure her livelihood, which has been a good one for her family. The official price for use of the fire is 375 rupees, about $6, but because she has control over the only sacred fire at Manikarnika, Ms. Devi can charge 2,000 to 3,000 rupees per body. She collects the cash in an iron chest and ferries it with an armed guard at the end of the day. One of her sons, Arjun Chowdhury, 47, collects the fees for bodies that come after 8 p.m. and handles other funeral duties at night, sleeping only during the day. Mr. Chowdhury sells people standard pyre fare: wood, coconuts, bananas, flowers, ghee, milk, incense sticks and expensive sandalwood. Other packages on offer include a sandalwood sawdust bath for the corpse and a three-hour chant for peace. Mr. Chowdhury said he provides the first set of five logs of wood required for the funeral pyre. The rest of the wood is provided by the relatives of the deceased. He then hands over the lighted straw to the person, who then uses it to light the funeral pyre. Ms. Devi said she wanted her two sons to become doctors or engineers, but the boys were routinely taunted and ostracized at school because of their caste. Eventually, they came back to Manikarnika to help their mother. “A Dom’s life is valued only at the crematorium because people are uncomfortable handling a dead body,” she said, chuckling. Ms. Devi said she was happy with her job, although she said there were times when she tired of watching corpses burn and smelling their burning flesh. But beyond the ghats, Doms have no status, and a life that revolves around the dead is rarely a joyful one. She recalled talking about her work with a former deputy prime minister, Lal Krishna Advani, now a senior leader of the right-wing opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, who was attending a funeral during the dead of night many years ago. “He was keen to know about our lives. I told him we lead a life of no hope,” she said. Ashis Nandy, a noted Indian social scientist, said Doms in Varanasi rarely break away from their families’ profession because it is lucrative, thanks to the spiritual importance of India’s holiest city to Hindus. “It stems from devotion to rituals and adherence to caste,” he said. “It will not change. Thousands of Indians visit the city in the hope to die on the banks of the river to avoid rebirth.” Many of those Indians arrive in Varanasi thinking they have only days left to live but end up staying for years in crowded  homes for the elderly. “They all live close by, waiting for death,” said Satyendra Singh, a businessman whose hotel, which is in a 17th-century palace, is close to Moksha Bhavan, Varanasi’s biggest resting home for those awaiting death. After Mr. Singh’s comment was repeated to her, Ms. Devi just smiled. It was a familiar concept: Her life, and her livelihood, was all about waiting for death.

Business   World War I Novel. Advertisement By David Kwong Mar 18, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — David Kwong is two people: he is both magician and puzzle constructor. At his very best, he combines the two, and today is a very nice example of that. Magic tricks work because prestidigitators are experts at misdirecting the unwitting public, and Mr. Kwong has done just that. With a wave of his wand, he’s made all of the ARMs in the puzzle disappear. I thought all four of the phrases Mr. Kwong used worked very well, even though it took me a few minutes to figure out where the ARM went in 24 Across’s GENT DISTRICT because I solved that using the crossings. (The original base phrase was GARMENT DISTRICT.) Still looking for the rest? Try BURGLAR ALARM for “Home-invading Gore?”s BURGLAR AL, DEATH WARMED OVER for “Exchange of vows again for the Grim Reaper?”s DEATH WED OVER and SNAKE CHARMER for “Emmy, Oscar and Grammy-winning reptile?”‘s SNAKE CHER. In non-theme news, I’m always pleased to see the A-GO-GO suffix. Maybe it’s because I’m a lover of kitsch. When you drive around the part of Florida where my parents live, many of the names of some of the finer retail establishments seem to sport the “a-go-go” or “o-rama” designation. That’s how you know it’s a classy joint, apparently. I mistakenly had BVI for British Virgin Islands at first for 47 Down, even though the Bahamas are not part of that island chain. The correct answer, of course is BWI, for British West Indies. Clue of the Day for me was “One instrumental in history” for the famous violin maker AMATI. Had maestro AMATI had his studio in Florida at the time, I am fairly sure the engraving on his delicate instruments would have been “Made by Strings a-go-go”. The only bone I have to pick with this puzzle is that NOR is more to my mind an abbreviation for Norway than NORW. Other than that, the whole thing was completely ARM-less, as far as I’m concerned. Let’s chat with Mr. Kwong: I came up with the idea for this puzzle years ago and am grateful that it’s finally seeing print. It was inspired by one of my all-time favorite books. That book is well-worn and dog-eared, and sits on my coffee table with “Don Quixote” and “Expert at the Card Table”. What I love so much about crosswords is that they ask something of you. So often today we find ourselves consuming, glued to our computers, watching the latest Internet video. But puzzles allow us to turn that off and solve! I hope your Tuesday morning was by brightened a little by this puzzle. I thoroughly enjoyed constructing it! And we enjoyed solving it. Please come back soon. Updated, 8:44 p.m. | O.K. Time to spill the beans. Yes, we were being had, sort of. The crossword puzzle you solved today was also part of a TED Talk given by constructor David Kwong, and there was a hidden message in the clues, which may be why they sounded a bit awkward (Wordplay readers did not comment that much on them, but the acrostic nature of the cluing was discussed in the comments on other blogs.) If you read the first letter of each clue in Mr. Kwong’s puzzle, a message is spelled out that has to do with a special trick he performed during his talk. That message is seemingly a string of colors and animals, but why? Well, when you read the first letters of those words, what you wind up with is: CHAOS / ORDER / OH, BY THE WAY, THE SHEEP CAN BE LEFT ___ (blank). Mr. Kwong’s TED Talk had to do with bringing ORDER to CHAOS through magic. By asking an audience volunteer to color in some animals on an easel and revealing pre-colored cards of animals colored exactly the same way (a COBALT HORSE, an AMBER OWL, a SILVER OX, a RED DONKEY and an EMERALD ROOSTER … the sheep was left blank), he was able to show exactly how he was able to “suggest” these colors to his volunteer and pre-plant them in her head. Unfortunately, the Mr. Kwong’s video of his talk will not be up for a while on the TED site, but the organizers of the TED Talk have published a blog post about his presentation, which you can read here. In addition, here’s a Q&A with Will Shortz about how this whole thing came to be. Many thanks to Emily McManus and Thu-Huong Ha for passing these posts along.

Foreign   In Our Pages: March 18. Advertisement 1914: Old Jewelry at London Museum LONDON — When the London Museum is opened in Stafford House next Monday the surprise will be the cases full of Elizabethan or Jacobean jewelry. This collection is the only important addition to the museum since it was housed in Kensington Palace. Curiously, little has been heard about the hoard, as officials maintain silence on the subject. No one seems to know anything about it, except that about a year ago, near St. Paul’s, someone unearthed what was evidently the contents of a shop full of gold and silver work. 1939: Surrealist Loses His Temper NEW YORK — Salvador Dali found a violent new expression for his subconscious last night by heaving a surrealist bathtub, plus himself, through one of Bonwit Teller’s Fifth Avenue show windows and getting himself arrested on a charge of malicious mischief. The Catalan artist was unhurt by his Fifth Avenue bathtub episode, but was pretty excited about it. Dali had decorated two show windows with tableaux of “Day” and “Night” in accordance with his rather peculiar conception of such phenomena, and when he returned to admire his handiwork he discovered the tableaux had been altered in accordance with the staff window dressers’ notions of these phenomena.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life. The same stories that caught the eyes of our generations of editors now offer us insight into the lives and interests of generations of Trib readers.

Science   Study Questions Fat and Heart Disease Link Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Many of us have long been told that saturated fat, the type found in meat, butter and cheese, causes heart disease. But a large and exhaustive new analysis by a team of international scientists found no evidence that eating saturated fat increased heart attacks and other cardiac events. The new findings are part of a growing body of research that has challenged the accepted wisdom that saturated fat is inherently bad for you and will continue the debate about what foods are best to eat. For decades, health officials have urged the public to avoid saturated fat as much as possible, saying it should be replaced with the unsaturated fats in foods like nuts, fish, seeds and vegetable oils. But the new research, published on Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, did not find that people who ate higher levels of saturated fat had more heart disease than those who ate less. Nor did it find less disease in those eating higher amounts of unsaturated fat, including monounsaturated fat like olive oil or polyunsaturated fat like corn oil. “My take on this would be that it’s not saturated fat that we should worry about” in our diets, said Dr. Rajiv Chowdhury, the lead author of the new study and a cardiovascular epidemiologist in the department of public health and primary care at Cambridge University. But Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the findings should not be taken as “a green light” to eat more steak, butter and other foods rich in saturated fat. He said that looking at individual fats and other nutrient groups in isolation could be misleading, because when people cut down on fats they tend to eat more bread, cold cereal and other refined carbohydrates that can also be bad for cardiovascular health. “The single macronutrient approach is outdated,” said Dr. Hu, who was not involved in the study. “I think future dietary guidelines will put more and more emphasis on real food rather than giving an absolute upper limit or cutoff point for certain macronutrients.” He said people should try to eat foods that are typical of the Mediterranean diet, like nuts, fish, avocado, high-fiber grains and olive oil. A large clinical trial last year, which was not included in the current analysis, found that a Mediterranean diet with more nuts and extra virgin olive oil reduced heart attacks and strokes when compared with a lower fat diet with more starches. Alice H. Lichtenstein, a nutritional biochemist at Tufts University, agreed that “it would be unfortunate if these results were interpreted to suggest that people can go back to eating butter and cheese with abandon,” citing evidence that replacing saturated fat with foods that are high in polyunsaturated fats – instead of simply eating more carbohydrates – reduces cardiovascular risk. Dr. Lichtenstein, who was not involved in the latest study, was the lead author of the American Heart Association’s dietary guidelines, which recommend that people restrict saturated fat to as little as 5 percent of their daily calories, or roughly two tablespoons of butter or two ounces of Cheddar cheese for the typical person eating about 2,000 calories a day. The heart association states that restricting saturated fat and eating more unsaturated fat, beans and vegetables can protect against heart disease by lowering low-density lipoprotein or so-called bad cholesterol. In the new research, Dr. Chowdhury and his colleagues sought to evaluate the best evidence to date, drawing on nearly 80 studies involving more than a half million people. They looked not only at what people reportedly ate, but at more objective measures such as the composition of fatty acids in their bloodstreams and in their fat tissue. The scientists also reviewed evidence from 27 randomized controlled trials – the gold standard in scientific research – that assessed whether taking polyunsaturated fat supplements like fish oil promoted heart health. The researchers did find a link between trans fats, the now widely maligned partially hydrogenated oils that had long been added to processed foods, and heart disease. But they found no evidence of dangers from saturated fat, or benefits from other kinds of fats. The primary reason saturated fat has historically had a bad reputation is that it increases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL, the kind that raises the risk for heart attacks. But the relationship between saturated fat and LDL is complex, said Dr. Chowdhury. In addition to raising LDL cholesterol, saturated fat also increases high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. And the LDL that it raises is a subtype of big, fluffy particles that are generally benign. Doctors refer to a preponderance of these particles as LDL pattern A. The smallest and densest form of LDL is more dangerous. These particles are easily oxidized and are more likely to set off inflammation and contribute to the buildup of artery-narrowing plaque. An LDL profile that consists mostly of these particles, known as pattern B, usually coincides with high triglycerides and low levels of HDL, both risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. The smaller, more artery-clogging particles are increased not by saturated fat, but by sugary foods and an excess of carbohydrates, Dr. Chowdhury said. “It’s the high carbohydrate or sugary diet that should be the focus of dietary guidelines,” he said. “If anything is driving your low-density lipoproteins in a more adverse way, it’s carbohydrates.” While the new research showed no relationship overall between saturated or polyunsaturated fat intake and cardiac events, there are numerous unique fatty acids within these two groups, and there was some indication that they are not all equal. When the researchers looked at fatty acids in the bloodstream, for example, they found that margaric acid, a saturated fat in milk and dairy products, was associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Two types of omega-3 fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fats found in fish, were also protective. But a number of the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly found in vegetable oils and processed foods, may pose risks, the findings suggested. The researchers then looked at data from the randomized trials to see if taking supplements like fish oil produced any cardiovascular benefits. It did not. But Dr. Chowdhury said there might be a good explanation for this discrepancy. The supplement trials mostly involved people who had pre-existing heart disease or were at high risk of developing it, while the other studies involved generally healthy populations. So it is possible that the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids lie in preventing heart disease, rather than treating or reversing it. At least two large clinical trials designed to see if this is the case are currently underway.

Sports   Hirscher Adds Slalom Trophy to Overall Title. Advertisement Advertisement By KELLEY McMILLANMARCH 17, 2014 LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland — During the weekend, Marcel Hirscher of Austria sat in a hot tub and relaxed after a long season spent fighting for the World Cup overall title. After placing fourth in the giant slalom here on Saturday, the battle was over — he had statistically won the 2014 overall trophy. What was less certain on Saturday was the outcome of his final race, the slalom on Sunday. Going into the race, Hirscher, 25, trailed Felix Neureuther of Germany by five points in the World Cup slalom standings. In order to clinch the World Cup slalom title, he needed to win the race. On Sunday, Hirscher skied two aggressive runs for a total time of two minutes 07.74 seconds, to notch the victory, his fifth of the season, and edge Neureuther for the slalom trophy by 76-hundredths of a second. The 2014 Olympic gold medalist Mario Matt of Austria finished third with a time of 2 minutes 8.82 seconds. It was Hirscher’s second slalom globe and, in clinching the 2014 World Cup overall title, he became the first Austrian man to win three straight overall titles and only the fourth man ever to do so. Advertisement “It is unbelievable,” Hirscher said after officially winning the slalom and overall titles on Sunday. “But enough time hasn’t gone by to give you my impressions and emotions. For my first globe, I need more than a year and a half to realize what I had done.” However, Hirscher’s slalom victory was marred by allegations of unsportsmanlike conduct on the part of his coach Mike Pircher, who set the first slalom course and created a difficult and awkward run that favored his racer, who skied first in the opening leg. Advertisement Before each race, coaches are selected randomly to set racecourses in the slalom, giant slalom and super-G events. “I think it would be better if you had a race where the level of skiing could be higher with more guys. When you set a course where only the first guy has a real chance of having a good run, that kind of eliminates what kind of race” you can have, said Ted Ligety of the United States who won his fifth season-long giant slalom trophy on Saturday. Unreasonable course settings have been an issue simmering on the men’s World Cup circuit this season, with athletes and coaches also pointing to the strange and challenging slalom courses set by Ante Kostelic of Croatia, the coach and father of racer Ivicia Kostelic, who set a difficult course in Kitzbühel, Austria, and again at the Sochi Winter Olympics. Neureuther added: “When it’s a course setting like this, it’s bad for our sport. It looks bad for TV. People think we are not good skiers. At a time like this, we need to think about the future of our sport and how we can get people watching skiing, so our sport will survive, so the ski companies will survive.” Hirscher and Neureuther suggested that the International Ski Federation, ski racing’s governing body, should consider implementing professional course-setters. Although he was upset by the first run’s course set, Neureuther was quick to praise Hirscher. “It was a very tough end, but I have to accept everything. He deserved the globe.” Advertisement Over the past three seasons, Hirscher’s dominance in the technical events, the giant slalom and slalom, has been almost unprecedented. He has reached the podium in 48 of 64 World Cup events, won Olympic gold in slalom, and gold and silver in the slalom and giant slalom, respectively, at the 2013 Alpine World Championships in Schladming, Austria. He placed in the top three in 12 out of 17 technical events this season, whereas Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, a speed specialist, who Hirscher beat by 131 points in the overall standings, was on the podium in seven of 15 speed events. “His consistency over the last couple of years has been pretty amazing. To be able to get on the podium, even in the top five, in every single race, that’s pretty impressive,” Ligety said. “And he’s supertough mentally — and that’s tough to be at that level week in and week out. That’s something people are rarely able to achieve.” Throughout the season, Hirscher and Svindal swapped the overall lead. Going into the finals this week, Svindal had a four-point advantage over Hirscher, and each man had two of his preferred events on the docket. It was anyone’s battle to lose. Beginning at the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, Svindal began to uncharacteristically slump. He left the Games early and without a medal, and went home to Norway to recover. Ultimately, when he returned to the World Cup circuit, he was unable to find his footing in time to salvage the overall title. “I think he lost some energy, to be honest, physically and mentally. You have to have that extra something to give at the start, not just your skiing,” said Kjetil Jansrud of Norway, Svindal’s teammate and close friend. Although Svindal lost the overall, he did win the downhill and super G trophies for the second straight year and was pleased with his performance this season. “I try to look at the positive. Be proud about it. I have skied well and that’s why I’m in this position,” Svindal said after the race on Thursday. “For sure the overall title is the biggest one, but the disciple titles are also cool.” Advertisement He added: “You know, that battle for the overall, it’s a tough one. It’s never ending. When you get someone that’s as consistent as Marcel, you get no breaks.” After the race on Sunday, Hirscher planned to celebrate his season, but not for long. “As soon as one season ends, the next one begins.”  Another title to Fenninger Anna Fenninger of Austria, the World Cup overall champion, added the giant slalom title on Sunday by winning the season-ending race. In Lenzerheide, Switzerland, she had to finish ahead of the pre-race standings leader Jessica Lindell-Vikarby of Sweden.That she did and duly won her fourth straight World Cup giant slalom. Fenninger’s two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 1.28 seconds was 0.25 faster than teammate Eva-Maria Brem. Lindell-Vikarby was third, trailing 0.33 behind Fenninger, whose 100 race points lifted her to victory by 26 points over the eight-race giant slalom season. Fenninger, the Olympic silver medalist in the giant slalom, got her first career World Cup discipline title. She completed an Austrian sweep of race victories and discipline titles on Sunday. Fenninger and Marcel Hirscher have given Austria its first overall title double since 2002. Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States was fourth-fastest in the morning run but dropped to 12th in the second run, 0.95 behind Fenninger. Advertisement Shiffrin, 19, finished the season sixth in the overall standings and seventh in the giant slalom. On Saturday, she won her fifth World Cup slalom this season to retain her discipline title. A version of this article appears in print on March 17, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Travel   A ‘Frozen’ Suite at an Ice Hotel. Advertisement A suite at Quebec City’s Hôtel de Glace brings aspects of Disney’s animated movie “Frozen” to life. Modeled after the central characters’ bedrooms, the “Frozen Suite” was designed and supervised by Michael Giaimo, the film’s art director. Loosely based on a Hans Christian Andersen tale, the movie focuses on the story of sisters Anna and Elsa and how their mythical town, Arendelle, unexpectedly turns from summer into an arduous winter. This concept fit Hôtel de Glace’s overall “Myths and Legends from Around the World” theme for 2014. Inside the suite are Anna and Elsa’s queen-size illuminated beds, tapestry etched into snowy walls, an ice fireplace and two sculpted armchairs. A public area in the hotel features an “activity cave” with an ice slide as well as a mural with the cast of characters carved on a wall. The suite was created in a week by two sculptors and their assistants, with “Walt Disney Studios working with the Hôtel de Glace to determine what was feasible to build in ice and snow,” Alicia Rochevrier, the hotel’s communications manager, said in an email. Ms. Rochevrier said that the beds’ special headboards were the most complicated to craft because the ice and snow were quite heavy to form into an awning. The hotel offers 17 suites and 27 standard rooms, and accommodations include complimentary cocktails served in glasses made out of ice, a warm breakfast and access to the hotel’s outdoor spa baths and sauna. Visitors need to bundle up: the ambient temperature is a constant  23 degrees, and sleeping bags are provided on beds. Like Elsa’s spell on Arendelle, the Ice Hotel does not last forever: it will be dismantled on March 23 and rebuilt from scratch the next year. Room rates for the Frozen Suite start at 850 Canadian dollars  for weekends and 625 dollars during the week with accommodations for two adults and two children.

Business   Fortress, Benchmark and Ribbit Buy Stake in Pantera Bitcoin. Advertisement Several prominent investment firms are joining forces to buy stakes in one of the biggest Bitcoin operations in the world. The publicly traded New York private equity and hedge fund firm Fortress Investment Group and two other investors are buying a stake in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, a San Francisco-based hedge fund operator that buys and sells virtual currencies. The creation of the partnership represents a significant step in the push to move Bitcoin into the financial mainstream at a time when several well-publicized claims of theft have pointed to potential weaknesses in the digital currency economy. Pantera Capital, the parent of Pantera Bitcoin, was founded in 2003 by Dan Morehead, a veteran of the hedge fund giant Tiger Management. For most of its existence, Pantera was a macro hedge fund. But since 2011, Mr. Morehead has grown increasingly fascinated with Bitcoin, he said in an interview on Tuesday. In recent months, he said, the firm’s staff of 16 has shifted its attention to work full time on investments in the virtual currency world. “We’re very excited about the promise of Bitcoin and how it can transform the way we move money,” Mr. Morehead said. “The promise and possibilities here are very broad.” When Pantera made its first regulatory filing in December, its Bitcoin fund was worth $147 million. That is significantly larger than the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a $55 million fund run by the New York firm SecondMarket that holds virtual currencies on behalf of investors. The big venture capital firms Benchmark and Ribbit Capital are taking stakes in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, along with Fortress. All are committing to buy and sell Bitcoin and other virtual currencies through Pantera. While regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money? Michael E. Novogratz, an executive at Fortress, had previously talked about his interest in Bitcoin, but until now it has been unclear how the firm was approaching digital money as an investment. Moving forward, Fortress said that it would make all of its Bitcoin purchases through Pantera.“This partnership brings together leading companies with a range of relevant expertise, well positioned to lead and capitalize on a potentially transformative evolution,” Mr. Novogratz said. In the years after the Bitcoin program was released by an anonymous founder known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, most of the dominant players were small start-ups with few links to the traditional financial world. Part of the allure of Bitcoin was that it allowed users to move and store money outside the banking system. Recently, however, a number of pioneers, like the Japanese exchange Mt. Gox, have run into trouble, shaking confidence in the entire Bitcoin network. At the same time, investors and financial firms with more established credentials have been expressing their growing interest in Bitcoin. Last week, Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street firm to issue a research report on Bitcoin’s potential to shake up different parts of the financial system. Much of the research has been focused on Bitcoin not just as a form of digital money, but also as a new payment system, buttressed by the computers linked into the Bitcoin network. The system is run according to a prewritten set of rules, which determines how the coins are created and moved between digital wallets. Mr. Morehead’s management firm is giving up some of its ownership in Pantera Bitcoin Partners, which manages the Bitcoin fund.

Science   Scientists Sound Alarm on Climate. Advertisement Advertisement Justin Gillis BY DEGREES MARCH 18, 2014 Early in his career, a scientist named Mario J. Molina was pulled into seemingly obscure research about strange chemicals being spewed into the atmosphere. Within a year, he had helped discover a global environmental emergency, work that would ultimately win a Nobel Prize. Now, at 70, Dr. Molina is trying to awaken the public to an even bigger risk. He spearheaded a committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest general scientific society, which released a stark report Tuesday on global warming. The report warns that the effects of human emissions of heat-trapping gases are already being felt, that the ultimate consequences could be dire, and that the window to do something about it is closing. “The evidence is overwhelming: Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are rising,” says the report. “Temperatures are going up. Springs are arriving earlier. Ice sheets are melting. Sea level is rising. The patterns of rainfall and drought are changing. Heat waves are getting worse, as is extreme precipitation. The oceans are acidifying.” In a sense, this is just one more report about global warming in a string going back decades. For anybody who was already paying attention, the report contains no new science. But the language in the 18-page report, called “What We Know,” is sharper, clearer and more accessible than perhaps anything the scientific community has put out to date. Advertisement And the association does not plan to stop with the report. The group, with a membership of 121,200 scientists and science supporters around the world, plans a broad outreach campaign to put forward accurate information in simple language. The scientists are essentially trying to use their powers of persuasion to cut through public confusion over this issue. Polls show that most Americans are at least somewhat worried about global warming. But people generally do not understand that the problem is urgent — that the fate of future generations (not necessarily that far in the future) is being determined by emission levels now. Moreover, the average citizen tends to think there is more scientific debate about the basics than there really is. The report emphasizes that the experts have come to a consensus, with only a few dissenters. “Based on well-established evidence, about 97 percent of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening,” it says. That is not the same as claiming that all questions about climate change have been answered. In fact, enormous questions remain, and the science of global warming entails a robust, evolving discussion. The new report walks through a series of potential consequences of planetary warming, without asserting that any is sure to happen. They are possibilities, not certainties, and the distinction is crucial for an intelligent public debate about what to do. The worst-case forecasts include severe food shortages as warming makes it harder to grow crops; an accelerating rise of the sea that would inundate coastlines too rapidly for humanity to adjust; extreme heat waves, droughts and floods; and a large-scale extinction of plants and animals. “What’s extremely clear is that there’s a risk, a very significant risk,” Dr. Molina said by telephone from Mexico, where he spends part of his time. “You don’t need 100 percent certainty for society to act.” Some of the scientists on Dr. Molina’s committee like to point out that people can be pretty intelligent about managing risk in their personal lives. It is unlikely that your house will burn down, yet you spend hundreds of dollars a year on insurance. When you drive to work in the morning, the odds are low that some careless driver will slam into you, but it is possible, so we have spent tens of billions of dollars putting seatbelts and air bags in our cars. Advertisement The issue of how much to spend on lowering greenhouse gases is, in essence, a question about how much insurance we want to buy against worst-case outcomes. Scientists cannot decide that for us — and the report recognizes that by avoiding any specific recommendations about what to do. But it makes clear that lowering emissions, by some means, is the only way to lower the risks. Because so many people are confused about the science, the nation has never really had a frank political discussion about the options. Only a few decades ago, the world confronted a similar question regarding chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, then common in refrigerators, air-conditioners, cans of hair spray and deodorant. At a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., conference in 1972, a California scientist named F. Sherwood Rowland learned that they were accumulating in the air. What, he wondered, would happen to them? He eventually put a young researcher in his laboratory, Dr. Molina, onto the question. To their own shock, the team figured out that the chemicals would break down the ozone layer, a blanket of gas high above the ground that protects the world from devastating levels of ultraviolet radiation. As the scientific evidence of a risk accumulated, the public demanded action — and eventually got it, in the form of a treaty phasing out the compounds. Global warming has been much harder to understand, not least because of a disinformation campaign financed by elements of the fossil-fuel industry. But the new report is a recognition among scientists that they bear some responsibility for the confusion — that their well-meaning attempts to convey all the nuances and uncertainties of a complex field have obscured the core message about risks. The report reflects their resolve to try again, by clearing the clutter. Will the American people hear the message this time?

Business   Sixty-Five Minutes. Advertisement By Victor Barocas Mar 20, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — Sixty-five minutes. That’s how long it took me to figure this puzzle out. I did this mainly by staring at the grid, occasionally frowning deeply at it in order to scare it into submission. I worked the clues one at a time, not really sure why some had only dashes (in the print version, these clues are combined), and crawled my way through a Thursday puzzle. Thursday puzzles are supposed to bring light and joy. This puzzle, for me, highlights the observation that some puzzles are experimental, more than anything. Maybe you had better luck. So, here’s what we have: the theme Victor Barocas offers us today, as far as I can tell, has to do with phrases that contain the word GET. From there, we have instructions in the clues that tell us what we can do with the GET (Nobody say anything. I’m not done yet) . Now, I have solved a lot of crossword puzzles in my time, but this one frustrated me. From one theme entry to another, I had no idea what to expect, which decreased my ability to gain a toehold in this grid by, I don’t know, a whole lot. Sure, go ahead, experiment on the crossword form. But please, don’t take my Thursday solving joy away. This did not feel like a Thursday to me. I got stuck on the very first theme entry at 18 Across. I got PATE GURNER ( a “Gripping read”) from the crossings, and thought there might be some Spoonerisms going on. Fair enough. Who doesn’t love a good Spoonerism? I did not spy the word GET at that point. See that “Get back!” in brackets after the clue? Read GET backwards in the entry, like so: PATE GURNER. From there, the GETs git going all sorts of ways, including not even being there, which really threw me for a loop. I wondered why that last entry, A BRID OO FAR had the T on top. If the GET is simply “lost”, why curve the TOO? Is it because the entry itself starts to wander off? [3/20/14 UPDATE: In the original post, I accidentally listed the entry as A BRIDGE OO FAR. The correct entry is A BRID OO FAR. I’ve corrected it in my post.] Here are the theme entries, as they are meant to be read: 18 Across “Get back!” = PATE GURNER 24 Across “Get down!” = STORAGE TANKS, with the GET going downward 50 Across “Get up!” = COLLEGE TOWNS, with the GET going upward 61 Across “Get lost!” = A BRIDGE TOO FAR, with the GET removed or “lost” In non-theme news, I loved the entry JEZEBEL, although I, personally, do not think of it as a feminist blog. Your mileage, of course, may vary. So, to recap, it’s perfectly fine to experiment with the crossword form and, in fact, it’s highly encouraged. I just didn’t enjoy this one because the theme kind of got lost on me. Let’s chat with Mr. Barocas: The inspiration for this puzzle came from Matt Gaffney’s meta-puzzles, which I enjoy very much. Every so often, he addresses the solver directly in the puzzle as part of the meta, and although at first I found it strange, it kind of grew on me, so I decided to make a non-meta puzzle that included direct address. I was rather pleased when I realized that the different GET phrases all exist. The big challenge, though, was that GET up and GET down aren’t as symmetric as they feel like they should be, making it quite hard to construct a symmetric grid. I had an idea a couple of years ago for a GET LOST theme that would have the word GET disappear (so GET would be lost) in two entries (e.g., TAR AUDIENCE or FOR ME NOT) and the word LOST appear in two (so they would get LOST). My friend David Hanson suggested JLOSTACOBEAN; neither of us could really figure out what “J. Lo’s taco bean” meant or how to clue it, but it was a terrific find. Sadly, the puzzle never quite got off the ground, but I guess that GET LOST lived on in this one in its own way. As always, I hope that solvers enjoyed the puzzle.

Travel   A New Cruise on the Loire. Advertisement Europe’s booming river cruise industry has set its sights on the Loire in France, where the M.S. Loire Princesse, the first riverboat with overnight cabins to cruise this river, will launch next year. Though the Loire’s shallow waters have kept larger vessels from being able to navigate the river, CroisiEurope recently unveiled plans to build a sleek new paddle-wheel boat, which requires less draft, to circumvent the issue. It will be the first paddle-wheel to join the company’s fleet of almost 40 riverboats. The 300-foot, three-deck cruiser is to feature a contemporary, ecologically friendly design, with space to accommodate almost 100 passengers, along with a full-size dance floor, lounge, restaurant and balconied cabins. The company also plans to outfit the ship with amenities like Wi-Fi and individually operated heating and air-conditioning units in each cabin. “CroisiEurope has been in business for almost 40 years and is constantly trying to innovate new itineraries to add to its repertoire,” Michel Grimm, the company’s international sales director, said in an email. And though it did have to meet many new technical and environmental requirements, the company was compelled to build a vessel that could operate in the Loire overnight in order to make the region’s specific “cultural experiences” available to its clients, he added. The ship’s six- to eight-day cruises will travel the Pays de la Loire region of France beginning in April 2015, making stops in the communes of Ancenis, Saumur and Bouchemaine, as well as the cities of Angers and Nantes, to visit historic chateaus and Unesco World Heritage sites.

Business   Learning How to Refine Oils. Advertisement By Brendan Emmett Quigley Mar 21, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY PUZZLE — This, in my opinion, was a nice Friday offering. A bit of a wrestle, a little stretching, a few gimmes, and sooner rather than later the puzzle is solved. Also, Brendan Emmett Quigley makes a clean puzzle and fills it with some very interesting stuff. If you haven’t seen the most recent episode of the “BETWEEN TWO FERNS” web series hosted by the actor Zach Galifianakis on the “Funny Or Die” channel, you can watch it here. Whatever your political leanings, it’s a funny interview that gets off to a hilarious start by billing the president as “Barack Obama (sp?), Community Organizer”. The title of the series has been in the news precisely because of this interview and, as Mr. Quigley says below, the fact that it was a 15-letter entry and brand new makes it a particularly fun discovery for a constructor. There are quite a few (not quite whopping, but close) unique entries here, in fact. ART MAJOR also gets Clue of the Day from me because of the wonderful misdirection of the clue (“One learning how to refine oils?”) and because The Girl is an ART MAJOR who happens to be doing a lot of painting right now. I also loved DO IT BY THE BOOK, SNOWDEN, who makes a debut as Edward SNOWDEN today, but was in a New York Times puzzle back in 1987 as the British statesman, and the fabulous looking and sounding instrument the CRUMHORN. I didn’t know about Sir Henry BESSEMER, but he was a big name in steel. So much good stuff in here, and that long central Down was fabulous. How does Mr. Quigley feel about it? Let’s find out. In my job, discovering a new name in the news is 15 letters is the equivalent of a religious experience. Well said, sir. Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Foreign   What’s in Veterans Affairs’ $164 Billion Budget?. Advertisement The secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Eric K. Shinseki, last week, outlined President Obama’s 2015 budget for the department before hearings of the House and Senate veterans affairs committees, calling for total spending of $163.9 billion, a 6.5 percent increase from last year. The plan asks Congress to allocate $68.4 billion for discretionary spending, a 3 percent increase from last year, which is largely used for health care, and $95.6 billion for mandatory programs such as disability compensation and pensions for veterans. Mr. Shinseki said he wants the spending to address three major goals: the continued expansion of health care access and other benefits for both new and aging veterans, ending homelessness among veterans and clearing the extensive backlog of disability claims. Clearing the backlog – defined as disability claims that have taken 125 days or longer to process – remains a benchmark that the department struggles to reach. Though the backlog has decreased in the last year, to just under 370,000 claims, veterans groups continue to criticize the department for its inability to eliminate the delays. And the work continues to grow. According Mr. Shinseki, 1.5 million new compensation and pension claims are expected to be filed in 2015, an increase of 20 percent over 2014. Spending directed at ending homelessness, one of Mr. Shinseki’s personal priorities, will increase by 14 percent, to $1.6 billion. In particular, spending for the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans, a hotline developed in 2010 as part of Mr. Shinseki’s plan to end homelessness by the end of 2015, would increase by 45 percent to $5.6 million. Mr. Shinseki, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009, drew fire at the Senate hearing on two of the department’s toughest issues: providing adequate care to veterans who suffer from traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress, and expanding access to services for veterans in rural areas. Senator Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont and the chairman of the Senate committee, probed Mr. Shinseki and his under secretary for health, Dr. Robert Petzel, on the department’s ability to respond to the fast-growing need for mental health services. “We are dealing now with hundreds of thousands of men and women who have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan who are dealing with traumatic brain injury and PTSD,” Senator Sanders said. “Are we making progress?” “This is a tough area for us,” Mr. Shinseki replied. “We are putting $7 billion against mental health, we have a separate funding line for traumatic brain injuries and we do research in this area.” That research, which takes place largely at five polytrauma centers run by the department across the country, would receive $580 million in direct appropriations as well as an additional $1.3 billion from the department’s medical care program under the president’s budget. “Budgeting,” Mr. Shinseki confessed, “is a little bit reactive. We look at what showed up at our medical facilities and we ask for resources to take care of the next population. We are working with DoD (Department of Defense) to try to anticipate what our requirements are going to be, just writ-large, and trying to understand what the mental health piece of that is.” A need for increased collaboration between the departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs is precisely what veteran advocacy groups have identified as being at the crux of the larger issue. Alex Nicholson, Legislative Director for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, believes that many of the issues facing veterans today could be addressed more quickly through broader cooperation between government entities. “The problem is not just a V.A. problem,” explained Mr. Nicholson in a phone interview last week. “And, the fix is not just a V.A. fix.” As the Defense Department continues reducing troop levels and the number of new veterans continues to grow, many veterans wonder if veterans affairs can significantly reduce homelessness, tame the backlog and expand mental health services. “Frankly, we’ve been at war for over a decade and we have small professional formations, smaller than when I served, who have carried this responsibility for carrying on these two operational missions now for this long,” Mr. Shinseki said before the Senate committee. “Because of the size of the force, they are rotated a number of times, multiple times, and we compound the issues, especially in mental health.” He added: “We owe these youngsters the best we can provide.” Jacob W.

Home   Meet Me in Chicago. Advertisement Advertisement By JESSE McKINLEYMARCH 19, 2014 CHICAGO — It seemed like such a simple question. “What can you tell me about your trivet?” I asked, sounding like someone inquiring about a doctor for a sick oak. The French saleswoman looked perplexed. “Tree-vet?” she said. “What is a tree-vet?” The scene of my confusion — and hers — was the International Home and Housewares Show in Chicago, an annual four-day extravaganza of home goods (and bads); consumer gadgets and gizmos, and kitchen, bath and living-room accessories. Oh yes, and trivets, which I soon discovered was a fancy word for “elevated hot pad,” and rhymes with “rivet.” The trivet in question was a nifty silicon model unveiled by the Paris-based Mastrad, one of thousands of exhibitors from across the world vying for attention at the show, which wrapped up on Tuesday at McCormick Place, the city’s giant lakeside convention center. Ignorance of kitchen lingo, mind you, does not preclude a visitor from enjoying the show’s strange brew of new ideas, oddball innovations and other hints of the zeitgeist of the American homestead. This year those trends seemed to include, among other things, a desperate demand for ever-brighter colored pots, pans and espresso makers; a sudden uptick in women’s grooming products; and the ongoing battle between various juicers and smoothie makers, even as they confronted a counterintuitive challenger: the dehydrator. Ice balls, as opposed to cubes, were big (Zoku has a new device for making them), as was anything with grip-technology (like the new concave cutting boards from Architec). And if the show was any measure, the nation also seems to be suffering from a dire shortage of ground pepper: booths at McCormick were lined with hundreds of kinds of pepper grinders — sleek, tall, hand-operated, battery-powered — a roster that included a two-and-half-inch model, the David, from the German company Ad Hoc, and a three-foot-high monster known as the Princess, from Chef Specialties in Pennsylvania, which looks as if it could take two people (or two princesses) to operate. Advertisement Luckily, I had backup. My girlfriend, Sarah, had traveled from her home in San Francisco to Chicago on the kind of mission undertaken by everyone from the writer Joseph Conrad to the designer team Joseph Joseph: to understand the nature of man. Or, in Sarah’s case, just one man: me. Much of the gear in my Albany home, after all, never graduated from college. My plates and bowls are mismatched; my cookware and pots are stained; my hand towels and flatware, mismatched and stained. Coffee, wine and spaghetti sauce are major culprits, but I also have a passion for making soup. Very, very sloppy soup. Sarah, meanwhile, has elegant kitchenware: forks and knives that resemble one another, and grown-up things like stemware, cloth place mats and the aforementioned trivets. “I like to surround myself with things I love,” she says simply, a category that fortunately usually includes me. So it was that Sarah agreed to accompany me, to help train my eye for new stuff and to entertain herself with what is essentially an exercise in extreme window shopping. The show is geared toward wholesale and retail buyers, not casual shoppers, although many of the products are either debuting or coming soon to a retailer near you. It draws 60,000 participants, from major players like Costco to small dreamers like Maia Ming Fong, a Barcelona-based artist whose delicate black-and-white teapots ($95 with two cups) were in a tiny booth at the back of one of the giant convention halls. Indeed, discovering little treats is the fun of the show, as is finding clever things like the Clip & Drain, a clip-on colander from a company called Chef’s Planet that allows dads like me to strain pasta with one hand while clutching the remote in the other. We started our trek on Saturday morning with a stop at Garnier-Thiebaut, the esteemed French linen maker, which recently introduced its Rue Montmartre collection with a brighter, more graphic design presumably to appeal to jaunty Americans. Sarah, however, is a traditionalist (her underused microwave basically doubles as a breadbox), and she preferred the classic look of the company’s City collection: tablecloths with gentle grays and subtle geometric patterns. Better yet, all the City designs are treated to resist stains, a major bonus for a man prone to spillage. (Did I mention my hand towels?) The next stop was decidedly lower-brow: kitchen mats ($29.99 to $69.99 each), the subject of a soft-focus makeover by Comfort Co., an offshoot of Sleep Innovations, which estimates that the average person spends 90 minutes a day standing up in the kitchen. Hence the “anti-fatigue” mats, which can be disguised with a variety of patterned covers. As boring as mats may be, the booth was popular, if only as a pit stop for foot-weary visitors, many of whom walk miles during the show. Advertisement “We get people that linger,” said Barry Jacobs, a Sleep Innovations official. Sure enough, midday meant a need for coffee (me) and tea (Sarah). Coffee accouterments are a staple of the Chicago show, but this year, tea seemed to be gaining steam — in the is-this-really-necessary category as well. Take the Teafu, for example, an infuser that resembles a pair of tongs with a soft plastic beak that promises to make your tea ... faster! (You can almost hear the ad: “Because the price of waiting is just too steep.”) Sarah is considerably more patient, hence the survival of our relationship, and preferred the basic beauty of the tin tea containers made by the Japanese company Kotodo. Covered in paper made from mulberry trees, with patterns that featured small shells and floral motifs, the containers sell for $5.80 to $59.80. A similarly quiet ethos was on display in the wares of another Japanese company, Kinto, whose Atelier collection of ceramic and porcelain bowls came in an array of pastels and earthen tones. For bigger bowls, we headed over to the Boska booth, which was introducing what it called the “biggest fondue set ever sold.” With three flame burners, the Party Fondue Mr. Big ($400) holds nearly two gallons of cheese. “It doubles as a baby bath,” Matt Zagorski, the company’s national sales manager, told us. I was fascinated: so much cheese. But Sarah preferred the smaller square containers ($30 to $40), as well as the cheese curler (starting at $49.99) designed to shave a thin, twisty layer off any semisoft fromage. “It makes cheese actually interact with people,” Mr. Zagorski said mysteriously. Advertisement Interacting with your food was the idea behind the products made by a Connecticut firm called iDevices, which is committed to using smartphones to save America from undercooked pork and desiccated turkey. The iGrill 2 (available in May for about $100) is a thermometer that uses four small probes to allow users to control how their meat is done — rare, medium, etc. — and then sends them a cellphone alert when the meat is ready. (Note: You do not place your smartphone in the oven with the thermometer.) The iGrill 2 was in the show’s Wired and Well expo, along with other high-tech innovations including the latest entrant in our nation’s 90-year quest for the perfect blender: the new Blendtec 725 ($649). It promises 100 speeds and a near mercenary efficiency, a case the company made with a splashy video, underscored with rave music, depicting the blocky machine destroying an orange in slow-mo. (Watching the carnage, we couldn’t decide if the company loved fruits, or really hated them.) Cater-corner to the Blendtec booth, a company called Kuvings was selling a slow juicer, made for people “too busy to juice,” but with enough time to watch a vegetable being masticated by its languorous blades. Slower still was a new line of food dehydrators from Excalibur, a Florida company, all of which have a 26-hour timer (not 24 hours, mind you: 26) and aim to capitalize on what the company sees as a healthy need for less liquid in food. As a rep with the company told me, “Dehydrating is getting huge.” Advertisement Sarah’s attention, meanwhile, was drawn to a different gadget: the Emjoi Micro-Pedi machine, which alleviated a tough spot on one of her now aching feet in less time than it took the Blendtec 725 to flog an orange. The handy little device (about $70) was one of dozens of women’s products — curlers, dryers, foot baths — that jumped into the market this year, perhaps signaling the resurgence of American women as primary breadwinners. As we went along, Sarah had been gently offering a few suggestions (including a lovely little dustpan, the Tiny Team from Full Circle, which mixed bamboo and plastic) and discouraging overkill, like the knife-sanitizing system for Pure Living that promised to use UV rays to kill germs. So far, though, I had yet to discover anything that (in Sarah’s words) I just loved. Until she took me, ever so casually, by the booth for Mauviel 1830, the copper cookware company that has been making kitchenware since, you know, 1830. The company was unveiling several new products, including a lovely sauté pan ($425) and a bain-marie ($300), another word, like trivet, that I had never heard before. But my eyes were drawn in another direction: a gleaming stockpot sitting quietly on the shelf. With a hammered copper exterior, it had a kind of rosy glow, reflecting the show’s lights this way and that. I was entranced, and smitten, by both the pot and my partner’s reasons for bringing me there. “I thought you could make soup,” Sarah said, sweetly. At $775, the pot cost about a month’s rent in Albany, but I quietly put it on my list of things to buy eventually. That, of course, and something nice for my girlfriend.

Science   Living With Cancer: The Cost of Trials Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. A recent CT scan made me realize that the clinical trial extending my life effectively excludes all but the most privileged cancer patients. I used to weasel out of scans. Chalk it up to trepidation about radiation and possible kidney damage, along with paranoid suspicions that such scans don’t yield definitive pictures. My oncologist and I had agreed to fudge on frequent testing. But the clinical trial did not. When I registered for the CT, a woman wearing a badge that read “financial navigator” handed me the requisite forms to sign. I explained that the CT should be billed to the Phase I trial, since I was undergoing it so the investigators could measure the efficacy of their drug. Unable to reach the trial administrator by phone, she asked, “Can we put it down as a self-pay since you can change it afterwards?” The clock was ticking. I would need to start drinking the gallons of what I call Kool-Aid, the drink that people under 140 pounds need to gulp during the two hours before an abdominal CT. I knew that I had to concede but wanted to know how much it would cost. “Oh,” she replied, “I couldn’t say.” I signed the form and, after receiving the paper bracelet, trudged down to the basement and began the long haul of swilling and waiting. The Kool-Aid — in science-speak, the gastrografin contrast solution — brought to mind my friend Judy, vomiting the barium milkshake she had to ingest in a different hospital. It was impossible to keep down, she reported, but her oncologist insisted on it. I touted the less viscous Kool-Aid and she asked a hospital radiologist who replied, “Sure, you could try that instead.” We shook our heads in disbelief at his nonchalance. Running repeatedly to the bathroom, I thanked my lucky stars that I did not need to take the drugs prescribed for people with allergic reactions to this test. The CT would be brief and painless, I knew, and therefore none of the anxiety of the first few scans plagued me as the technician accompanied me down the hall to the scanner. “I can’t tell when I can get a nurse to access your port,” she said, positioning me on the narrow plank facing the gaping mouth of the huge machine. “There were massive cutbacks two months ago. Would you rather wait or have me stick you?” At least I was fully clothed while making this decision. Praying a vein would work, I eyed the triangular bar hanging from a pulley over my head while the technician established a line and took cover in another room. The conveyor belt moved me so deep into the bowels of the cave-like mechanism that the overhead metal bar, which I clutched with upraised hands, clanged against it. Only my head remained just outside of the giant doughnut. “Take a breath and hold,” a mechanical female voice said. Did they change it to a male voice for men? I wondered. Conveyed back out, I heard, “Breathe.” Through the IV line, the technician injected another contrast agent that, she told me, would give me an awful taste in my mouth and make me feel as if I were wetting my pants, and then the process was repeated. “Take a breath and hold.” “Breathe.” After the technician removed the needle in my arm, I limped out of the hospital determined to control my nausea with peppermint. Although I had not eaten for some 20 hours, I asked my husband to stop the car on the way home only to use a gas station restroom. The nausea I had felt that day returned some time later when I received a bill for $4,567. Because standard practice of care for recurrent ovarian cancer includes a CT every three months, the trial did not cover the cost of this scan. At registration, I had been thinking in terms of the trial paying or me paying. Instead of saying “self-pay,” I should have handed the “financial navigator” my insurance cards. Adjustments would have to be made with billing services. My mistake at registration revealed the exorbitant price of the CT, which otherwise would have been masked by the incomprehensible maze of paperwork sent by providers. The trial exacts large expenses: it requires that people have periodic scans and does not pay for them. How could patients who are under-insured or not insured at all be included in such a clinical trial? How could people working for the minimum wage afford $18,268 a year for CTs? If the trial were in a remote hospital, travel and lodging would raise that price tag, as would the need to take days off from work for recurrent blood tests. Now I understand why low-income patients are underrepresented in cancer trials, although they bear a disproportionate burden of cancer mortality. For economic status is of course a barrier not only to trials but also, more alarmingly, to detection and treatment. I made the call to billing services. I took a breath and got put on hold. Susan Gubar is a distinguished emerita professor of English at Indiana University and the author of “Memoir of a Debulked Woman,” which explores her experience with ovarian cancer.

Sports   Yankees’ Kelly Johnson Focuses on Playing Third, Not Replacing Alex Rodriguez. Advertisement Advertisement By PETER KERASOTISMARCH 20, 2014 LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — There are two holes to fill in the Yankees’ infield, and two questions are always asked about them. Who is going to replace Robinson Cano at second base? And who is going to play third base? Alex Rodriguez is rarely mentioned, as if he were not even a Yankee the past 10 seasons, much less one who hit 309 home runs during that time. The perception is not that Kelly Johnson is replacing Rodriguez. It is more that he is going to be the next Yankees third baseman. And Johnson is fine with that. “No, no,” Johnson said, shaking his head at the mere idea that he is replacing Rodriguez, who is serving a season-long suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs. “I don’t look at it like that. It doesn’t even cross my mind. And I don’t mean that in any disrespect. But that, to me, is not the case. And no one has said it’s the case, so it’s not anything that I would ever perceive, nor would I ever create that perception. I’m here to do what I can do, do my job, and that’s all I can worry about.” Johnson, 32, is an eight-year major league veteran. He has played in 1,051 games, but only 16 at third base. All 16 of those games came last season, when he played for Tampa Bay, occasionally filling in for Evan Longoria. He has been a career second baseman, but the Yankees have Brian Roberts, who, like Johnson, was an off-season free-agent signing, playing that position. Advertisement Johnson has been a fast learner, which was the Yankees’ hope when they signed him. He started at third base again Wednesday, going 0 for 2 with a walk and a run scored in the Yankees’ 7-0 win against the Atlanta Braves. The game lowered Johnson’s spring training batting average to .258, almost identical to his career .253 average. But the Yankees, in many ways, are not looking for another Rodriguez. They are looking for a third baseman who can field cleanly, hit a bit and stay healthy. They once had a player like that: Scott Brosius. Brosius, a career .257 hitter with the same type of occasional power as Johnson, spent four seasons with the Yankees. In three of them, 1998 through 2000, the team won the World Series. In Rodriguez’s 10 years, often filled with drama and occasionally with acrimony, the Yankees won one Series. Rather than copy a page from recent history, the Yankees have flipped back to what worked for them 15 years ago. Third base is a new position for Johnson, and he has been busy most mornings on the back fields of the Yankees’ spring training complex, working with Mick Kelleher, the team’s de facto infield instructor. “He’s picked it up real fast,” Kelleher said. “I think he’s confident. He likes the position. We’ve done a lot of early work this spring. His learning curve has been pretty rapid. We’ve covered a lot of stuff, and he has picked it up very well. I was surprised, because it’s a very difficult position to play.” There are intricacies to the position beyond the obvious — angles, reaction time, throwing distance and the like. “When you shift to a new spot, it comes with new responsibilities,” Johnson said. “At third base, you’re also responsible for bunts; there are cutoffs, relays, little nuances. I’m working hard.” Advertisement So far, the Yankees like what they see. Manager Joe Girardi stopped short of saying Johnson would be the everyday third baseman, but he said, “He’s going to play a lot; let’s put it that way.” Girardi added that before camp, the Yankees had weighed the idea of a third-base platoon. Johnson is a left-handed hitter, and Eduardo Nunez, a natural shortstop who has gained experience at third base, hits from the right side. “We kind of thought a little bit about that going into the season, when we signed Kelly,” Girardi said of a possible platoon. “But his at-bats have been good against right-handers and left-handers.” So the position continues to look like Johnson’s, with little mention of the superstar player who preceded him there. INSIDE PITCH Ivan Nova had his strongest outing of spring training, throwing six and a third innings of two-hit ball against the Braves, striking out five and walking none. Nova, 25, said he was feeling more comfortable as a major league pitcher, although he stopped short of saying he was a veteran. Nova offered an exchange he had with the pitching coach Larry Rothschild earlier in the week as an indication that he was maturing: “Larry said, ‘What are we going to work on?’ I told him, ‘Keeping my ball down.’ He said: ‘Wow. I remember you used to say, I don’t know; you tell me.’ ” ... Derek Jeter, who continues to receive warm applause in opposing stadiums, was 0 for 4, lowering his spring batting average to .132. Joe Girardi said he was not concerned. “My guess is that he’s not going to panic either way,” Girardi said. “I think the important thing is that he just feels good, and if he feels good, he’ll be in a good place.” ... Jacoby Ellsbury continued to nurse a tight right calf, and he will again sit Thursday, pushing the number of days that he has been unavailable to five. In his place against the Braves, the rookie Adonis Garcia knocked in two runs with a double. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Sierra Club Trips for Younger Travelers. Advertisement In order to take more young people into the wilderness and bring them onto its membership rolls, the Sierra Club is offering trips (some with discounts) that it hopes will entice the 30-and-under crowd. In addition to its usual lineup, the legacy environmental activist group with a long history of leading outdoor tours is publicizing a variety of domestic trips for younger participants, including backpacking, service trips, and multisport samplers. Some are run by their “more youthful leaders,” according to an announcement sent to members, or timed to coincide with holiday weekends, while others are tailored for anyone on a budget. While in the past, the Sierra Club was the go-to organization for people of all ages looking to visit wild areas and learn backpacking and outdoor skills, more options are now available with sites like Meetup and the growth in the adventure travel market, said a Sierra spokesman, Jason Halal. As a result, he said, Sierra’s demographics over the last couple decades have shifted toward retirees and baby boomers. Along with younger leaders and lower prices, this year Sierra Club is offering a “Young Adventurers Fund,” where those 18 to 30 can take $300 off of trips, such as a multisport sampler in Hawaii and several hikes in California, including a 20s-and-30s-only outing to Yosemite that touts youthful camaraderie, vegetarian meal options, and happy hours.

Business   Signs of Things to Come. Advertisement By Greg Johnson Mar 22, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Well, this was a zippy outing. With entries like FLEW BY and RAN ALONG, how could you not solve this puzzle by Greg Johnson at a relatively fast clip? I jumped around on this one, and was RED HOT until I got to 5 Down.

Science   In Many States, Few Legal Rights for C.C.R.C. Residents. Advertisement “I’m not naïve about the corporate world,” Burton Richter told me when we spoke about the class action lawsuit he and other residents are bringing against Vi at Palo Alto, a very upscale continuing care retirement community. Dr. Richter, 83, has served on corporate boards. He directed the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center for 15 years, among his other faculty and administrative positions at the university. And his honors include the Nobel Prize in physics. The five other named plaintiffs in the proposed suit have impressive resumes, too, with an abundance of advanced degrees. Yet when they grasped that Vi’s management had not stashed their sizable entrance fees in a reserve account, “it astounded me and a lot of the residents,” Dr. Richter said. C.C.R.C.s are state regulated, and “there is no consistency from state to state as to what residents’ rights are,” said Katherine Pearson, a Penn State law professor and authority on this type of senior housing. Though such communities come in many configurations — some operate more like rentals, without big upfront fees — buying into a place like the Vi can take most of a resident’s life savings. Yet most state regulations, if they exist at all, emphasize disclosure more than consumer protection. “You can have a financial disclosure law that puts 99 percent of the burden on the resident to understand its significance,” Ms. Pearson said. New York and New Jersey have strong C.C.R.C. regulations, she said; Virginia’s are weak, and California’s have serious gaps. Most don’t require reserve funds for the eventual refunds of entrance fees.  So how can older people who aren’t Nobel laureates, but are contemplating moving into a C.C.R.C., figure out whether a community is financially stable and smoothly run, whether residents’ interests are protected, whether the investment makes sense? The National Continuing Care Residents Association, incorporated in 1999, works to educate prospective residents and increase state oversight. With its 1,200 individual members, nine state associations and 38 member C.C.R.C.s, it probably represents close to 50,000 people, the group’s incoming president, Dan Seeger, estimated. One of its committees has drafted a national residents’ “bill of rights” and expects to present it at the group’s semi-annual meeting in Mystic, Conn., next month. Other committees are working on model laws to increase financial transparency and stability, which they hope state governments will adopt. The association also wants to develop an index of financial solvency, with which prospective residents can compare facilities. “Right now, the average shopper is floundering,” Mr. Seeger said. “This is a vulnerable population that probably believes there’s more government regulation than there is.” Let me direct you to two association websites. The main site contains information about the organization, including a list of state associations. The site informally dubbed NaCCRA U takes a more educational approach. Jack Cumming, an actuary and the group’s research director, has posted scads of videos and consumer guides, research documents and proposals. Neither site is a model of user-friendly navigation; finding the information you want requires some poking around. To see court filings from C.C.R.C. litigation, including the Vi lawsuit, for instance, you need to look under the News tab on the NaCCRA U top menu bar. (Can’t some semi-retired graphic designers and programmers design a snazzier and more serviceable website for these folks?) Nevertheless, novices in the world of C.C.R.C.s can learn a lot from what’s there. “They’re a good group, very committed to C.C.R.C.s and wanting to do things to strengthen the industry,” said Steve Maag, even though he’s often on the other side of the fence as the director of residential communities for Leading Age, which represents nonprofit providers. “The stuff they put out is fairly accurate and well thought out.” Ms. Pearson also recommends an online tool called LifeSite Logics, started by a financial planner and an accountant who operate independently of C.C.R.C. developers and providers. LifeSite delivers financial data for hundreds of C.C.R.C.s — occupancy rates, operating margins, recent fee increases — for about $40 a search. Ms. Pearson discusses and links to LifeSite in a post on the Elder Law Prof Blog, which she writes and edits with other law professors. People who live in these complexes tend to like them. “All of us believe in the C.C.R.C. way of life, the value and usefulness of seniors banding together to mutually help each other meet the contingencies of growing old,” Mr. Seeger said. But C.C.R.C.s essentially offer a form of long-term care insurance, in which seniors pay in advance to have care later on, with much less state regulation than insurance companies face. “In boom times, they make so much sense,” Ms. Pearson said of C.C.R.C.s. “With the slowdown in the economy, these issues have come about.” Now that the recovery means more C.C.R.C.s on drawing boards, she doesn’t want those issues forgotten.

Sports   Stung by an Upset a Year Ago, the Aztecs Avoid Another. Advertisement Advertisement By JOHN BRANCHMARCH 21, 2014 SPOKANE, Wash. — San Diego State knew that unsung New Mexico State had upset New Mexico this season. And the Aztecs had spent a year being reminded that they were victims of Florida Gulf Coast’s mesmerizing N.C.A.A. tournament run last March. The Aztecs, seeded fourth in the West Region, barely overcame those worries with a tense 73-69 overtime victory over 13th-seeded New Mexico State on Thursday, advancing to face another upstart team on Saturday. The Aztecs (30-4) will play 12th-seeded North Dakota State, a surprise winner over fifth-seeded Oklahoma. Guard Xavier Thames, the Mountain West Conference’s player of the year, led San Diego State with a game-high 23 points. San Diego State never trailed, and it seemed to have the game in hand with 32 seconds left and a 5-point lead. But New Mexico State’s Renaldo Dixon scored off a missed shot with 15.6 seconds remaining, and San Diego State turned the ball over on the inbounds pass. Advertisement Guard Kevin Aronis missed a 3-point attempt from above the top of the key, but the Aggies got the rebound and gave him another chance. Aronis moved to his left, stopped and drained the tying basket from about 25 feet, well beyond the arc, with six seconds left. Thames’s running shot at the buzzer missed. But his first jump shot in overtime gave the Aztecs the lead again, and they never gave it up. Dwayne Polee II missed a free throw with 6.8 seconds left in overtime and San Diego State clinging to a 70-68 lead. After a timeout, he made the second. Daniel Mullings was fouled with two seconds left, before he could attempt a potential tying 3-pointer. He made the first free throw and missed the second intentionally, hoping the Aggies would get the rebound. But Polee did, and he made two free throws to secure the victory. For most of the game, Thames was more than enough of a counterweight to New Mexico State’s 7-foot-5-inch, 355-pound Sim Bhullar. Bhullar, a sophomore center, scored 14 points, mostly on dunks. Mullings led the Aggies (26-10) with 15 points. Go to Home Page »

Travel   In Paris, Pictures at an Airport Exhibition. Advertisement The wait before boarding a plane can feel interminable, but those passing through Paris’s Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport have a stimulating alternative to idle perfume-testing in the tax-free zone. (Leave it to the French to offer a last gasp of art even as you’re on the brink of departure.) Espace Musées, a diminutive museum housed in the airport’s Terminal 2E, just inaugurated its third temporary exhibition. Open since late 2012, the free showcases — in English, Chinese, and French — are accessible for passengers who have checked in. This art-amid-transportation phenomenon exists in a handful of airports worldwide to lesser degrees: The Los Angeles International Airport held Influx, a public art festival in 2013, while Athens International Airport has a permanent exhibition related to Neolithic-era archaeological artifacts. Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum has a sister permanent space at Schiphol Airport featuring Dutch masters. Espace Musées, however, offers a rotating lineup of temporary exhibitions that shuffles every six months. It’s an ambitious rhythm commensurate with any cosmopolitan cultural institution. Serge Lemoine, who was president of the Musée d’Orsay from 2008-11, heads up and plans the exhibitions. For each show, Espace Musée teams with an individual Parisian art establishment. The inaugural exhibit was in partnership with the Rodin Museum; the second with the Dubuffet Foundation. The newest expo, “From Le Brun to Calder: Furniture from Louis XIV to Today,” is a selection of furnishings and tapestries pulled from the Mobilier National collection. Historically, it was the institution commissioned to provide lavish fixtures and tapestries for the king and his court; today, it conserves thousands of both modern and centuries-old furniture and textiles. (It runs through Sept. 17.) Twenty pieces compare works made over four centuries. A behemoth bronze-edged set of drawers used by Louis XIV (designed by André-Charles Bulle) is juxtaposed between bright abstract tapestries by Alexander Calder and Joan Miró. The architect Le Corbusier is here shown in flat tapestry form, the nonfigurative silhouettes from his painting “Les Musiciennes” hanging alongside the painter Charles Le Brun’s muted landscape, created almost three centuries earlier. Jean Veber’s fanciful world of fairy tale characters — sleeping gnomes, roaming giants, placid unicorns — is seen on seat backs and fire screens.

Business   What an Electric Current Does Not Flow Through. Advertisement By Ian Livengood Mar 23, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. SUNDAY’S PUZZLE — Today’s puzzle by Ian Livengood contains one of my favorite quotations, yet I am going to predict that we will have at least a few people who take issue with the fact that THOMAS EDISON is presented as the sole inventor of the INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULB. He patented it, of course, but there are many people who feel that, had EDISON not been a particularly good businessman, Nikola Tesla would have had a much more important place in the light bulb invention section of the history books. But back to the quote, and this terrific puzzle. If you are pursuing anything — a creative endeavor, an invention, a career — it is always worth remembering that failure is just another way to learn and refine your technique (Note: Because of stalking laws, this probably doesn’t apply to personal relationships.) The quote, as attributed to Mr. EDISON, is “I HAVE NOT FAILED; I HAVE JUST FOUND TEN THOUSAND WAYS THAT WON’T WORK.” See also, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” I love that. How many wonderful things would we be missing in life if artists and inventors just gave up the first time something didn’t work? So we have the quote and we have THOMAS EDISON, and we also have his nickname, THE WIZARD OF MENLO PARK in the grid, but there’s one more absolutely delightful part of this theme. See those circles in the grid? The make a funny shape, don’t they (don’t forget the two circling the O and the M in 96 Across.) Turns out that they make the shape of one of those INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBs Mr. Edison is famous for, and if you read the message counterclockwise from the A in 64 Across, you get a phrase that is not only familiar to inventors and artists, but to puzzle solvers as well: AHA MOMENT. Isn’t that just awesome? While you’re munching the SESAME BAGELS that Mr. Livengood thoughtfully left us for our Sunday Solvers’ Brunch, also take note of some of the groovy long entries, like DNA MOLECULE, OPEN CIRCUIT (a nod to the rest of the theme, perhaps?), METALLICA, CHICAGO BULLS and THE NINERS. Let’s hear from Mr. Livengood about why this idea turned him on: I saw a clue for AHA and — wait for it — the light went on in my head. The AHA MOMENT spelled out as a light bulb was the next logical step, followed by THOMAS EDISON and INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULB (a 21!). I toyed with listing other Edison inventions or accomplishments, but a quote seemed more appropriate. The construction was tricky since I couldn’t have the themers running through the middle of the grid mucking up the circled answers. But aside from two or three short clunkers, I’m pleased with the fill. I paused at inserting DNA MOLECULE and OPEN CIRCUIT since they seemed too close to the Edison/electricity/science theme, but eventually decided to roll with them. Hope solvers enjoy the puzzle!

Foreign   As Numbers Swell, Students Pledge to Continue Occupying Taiwan’s Legislature. Advertisement   The number of protesters in Taipei has grown dramatically since late Tuesday, when several hundred stormed the legislative chambers and barricaded themselves inside. Outside, thousands more supporters line the streets around the Legislature, and many of those Saturday had slept outside overnight. The protests were set off by efforts by Mr. Ma’s governing party, the Kuomintang, or K.M.T., to push through an agreement with China that would lower barriers for the two sides to each other’s service sectors. Lawmakers had previously agreed to a detailed review of the pact, which was signed in Shanghai in June 2013 by two semiofficial organizations representing China and Taiwan. Opponents of the trade deal say it will harm businesses in Taiwan and will allow China to greatly increase its economic influence over the self-governed island. A K.M.T. legislator, Chang Ching-chung, advanced the measure to the floor on March 17, skipping over the promised review, which incited the student-led protests. The opposition Democratic Progressive Party says that move broke an agreement to hold an itemized review of the trade deal. The K.M.T. said the move was necessary because the opposition was blocking the progress of the measure’s review. On Friday, students occupying the Legislature called for Mr. Ma to meet with them and discuss their demands that the service trade agreement be blocked and that cross-strait trade agreements be more closely monitored by the Legislature. The president declined, and the students announced that they would continue their occupation of the Legislature and called for protests at governing party offices. Prime Minister Jiang Yi-huah met with demonstrators outside the Legislature on Saturday afternoon and told them that the executive branch had no intention of dropping the trade pact. The students call their protests the Sunflower Movement, and say the flower is symbolic of the light and transparency they want to bring to the government. “When I saw that the trade services bill had advanced without any review, it seemed like an authoritarian technique,” said Sam Wu, a 33-year-old clinical psychologist who joined the protests on Friday. “I thought it was unjust. That’s why we’re upset.” An official from Mr. Ma’s office told the Central News Agency that the president was willing to discuss the trade deal but wouldn’t be forced into talks. The K.M.T, holds 65 of 113 legislative seats, versus 40 for the Democratic Progressive Party, giving the governing party the votes to push through the measure. The opposition has endorsed the protests, calling on its members to support the students and activists occupying the Legislature. The student leaders, for their part, have sought to distance themselves from the opposition. “This is not a party movement,” said Shih I-lun, a spokesman for the students. “This is a movement of the whole society.” The Legislature’s speaker, Wang Jin-pyng, has said that he does not plan to have the students removed by force, local newspapers reported Friday. There were attempts to oust them in the hours after the occupation began Tuesday, and students barricaded the chambers with chairs. Workers have placed barbed-wire barriers around nearby buildings. Large groups of police officers, some holding riot shields, have been stationed around the Legislature. As speakers alternate between lectures on economic matters and rallying songs, volunteers pass out food, water and blankets, clear trash and try to keep lines of supporters moving through the crowded, narrow streets. “I’m not sure what result this will have in the end,” said Mr. Wu. “But we should use every means to let our government know what we want.” Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world. Drawing on timely, engaging dispatches from The Times’ distinguished team of China correspondents, this blog brings readers into the debates and discussions taking place inside a fast-changing country and details the cultural, economic and political developments shaping the lives of 1.3 billion people.

Sports   20 Years Later, U.C.L.A. Knocks Off Tulsa. Advertisement Advertisement By BILLY WITZMARCH 22, 2014 SAN DIEGO — Geography has never been a strong suit of U.C.L.A. basketball players. Before one N.C.A.A. tournament game against Penn State, a Bruin said he thought the Nittany Lions played in the Ivy League. Before U.C.L.A. opened the 1994 tournament against Tulsa — with a 112-102 loss — another Bruin said he did not know the university was in Oklahoma. Twenty years later, the Bruins drew Tulsa again — and this time they proved they had learned not only their geography but some history, too. They avoided another stunner by the Golden Hurricanes, pulling away in the second half Friday night for a 76-59 victory in the South Region. Which team do you think will win? Eh, never mind that. Tell us which teams’ losses would give you the greatest joy, and which team’s success would make you most happy. U.C.L.A. has not advanced past the first weekend of the tournament since 2008, the last of three consecutive Final Four appearances. But all that stands between the fourth-seeded Bruins, who knocked off Arizona to win the Pacific-12 Conference tournament, and a trip to the Round of 16 is 12th-seeded Stephen F. Austin, which shocked Virginia Commonwealth earlier Friday. Norman Powell, playing in his hometown, ended the game emphatically for U.C.L.A. with a slam dunk in the final minute that delighted the large contingent of fans who had made the two-hour drive. But U.C.L.A.’s top performer was Jordan Adams, who had 21 points, 8 rebounds (5 on offense) and 4 assists. Adams may also be the best defensive player on a team that has just recently started to play well at that end. Tulsa narrowed its deficit to 35-32 early in the second half, but Adams hit a 3-pointer that began a 10-0 U.C.L.A. run, giving the Bruins a working margin the rest of the way. Tulsa cut the gap to 5 on a pair of occasions. But after DeAndre Wright sliced U.C.L.A’s lead to 59-54 with less than five minutes remaining, Tulsa could manage only two more baskets.

Travel   Sit Back and Soak Awhile in Natural Springs. Advertisement Instead of pushing traditional spa services, several hotels around the world are focusing on expanding natural hot springs on-site as a way for guests to unwind. A recent renovation at Calistoga Spa Hot Springs in Napa Valley, Calif., for example, added four mineral pools with temperatures ranging from 80 to 106 degrees. Dunton Hot Springs, a resort in Colorado’s San Juan Mountains, has five natural sulfur-free hot springs and is working on creating a sixth. The new Nayara Springs in northern Costa Rica has natural hot springs running through it, and each of its 16 private villas has a plunge pool fed by their waters. Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts has two properties in China where natural springs are a highlight: the Banyan Tree Chongqing Beibei in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing has a 100-degree hot spring attached to its 107 rooms and seven additional indoor and outdoor springs as part of its spa. Angsana Tengchong Hot Spring Village (another Banyan Tree) in the Yunan province has 43 mineral-based springs spread over 180,000 square feet. Two Bunch Palms in Desert Hot Springs, Calif., is in the midst of an $11 million renovation that includes adding two hot springs to its current one. The pools will be heated to 104 degrees and each will be able to accommodate at least 20 people. Susie Ellis, the president of SpaFinder Wellness Inc., an online service that connects consumers with spas, said that soaking in hot springs is an ancient practice that’s finally coming into vogue because travelers are more interested in natural treatments. “They feel good, relieve stress, and there are a lot of them around the world which are finally being tapped into,” she said. Any health benefits aside, the biggest perk of hot springs at hotels might be their affordability; most properties don’t charge their guests to use them.

Business   Start-Up Data Storage Firm Actifio Hits $1 Billion Mark. Advertisement   Today, a young start-up, Actifio, is drawing similar investor interest in a decidedly unflashy sector: data storage. On Monday, Actifio announced that it had raised $100 million in new financing, valuing the entire company at $1 billion. That vote of confidence places Actifio in an elite club of start-ups with 10-figure valuations, stepping up the pressure on the company to deliver on its ambitions. Though little known outside of technology circles, Actifio is rapidly gaining large corporate customers as it attacks a problem that the incumbent data storage firms have been slow to address. Its software, which costs an average of $349,000 for a three-year contract, allows a company access to a virtual version of backup copies of data, freeing up space and improving the overall efficiency of the company’s data storage. Actifio’s backers draw a comparison to VMware, which was a leader in creating software that was critical to cloud computing. While that expanded the amount of work a single computer server could do, Actifio’s product is aimed at enhancing a data center. “An idea like this comes along about once a decade,” said Jamie Goldstein, a partner at North Bridge, a venture capital firm that was an initial investor in Actifio and participated in the latest financing round. “Data has become such an important part of the tech economy, and the entire economy. Anybody who is collecting a lot of data is going to be facing this problem.” Actifio, which was founded in 2009, hopes to go public at some point next year, and its investors are betting on a big payday. An investment firm, Tiger Global Management, led the latest investment round, which included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and other venture capital firms. The company, based in Boston, is not profitable, but it had other impressive numbers to show its investors. It says that its bookings grew by 182 percent last year, and that it now has more than 300 business customers around the world. Those include companies like Time Warner Cable, Netflix, IBM and Unilever. One customer, the big private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is in the process of putting the software in place in North America and Europe. Peter Sung, a vice president for information technology at K.K.R., said the software greatly reduces the time it takes to retrieve copies of data and makes those copies easier to manage. Actifio has a potential rival in EMC, the data storage giant, which last year increased its focus on managing copies of data. In response, Actifio’s founder and chief executive, Ash Ashutosh, wrote a blog post sarcastically congratulating EMC on “recognizing the transformational impact of copy data management.” But for the most part, large data storage firms have hesitated to embrace this business, in part because it poses a threat to their main activity of selling more storage space, said Ashish Nadkarni, a research director at IDC. “This was never a technology problem,” Mr. Nadkarni said. “It was always a matter of, ‘O.K., so, if we bring this technology to market, it is going to mean less sales for us.’ ” Mr. Ashutosh previously had success in a related business. Another company he founded, AppIQ, which made software to manage storage infrastructure, was sold to Hewlett-Packard for $300 million in 2005. After a stint at H.P., he joined Greylock as a partner. The idea for Actifio came while he was analyzing trends in the field of enterprise software companies, he said. The comparison to VMware, invoked by Actifio itself, is a complicated one. VMware has sought to reposition itself in recent years, in the face of increased competition and a changed technology landscape. But Actifio does not expect to encounter a similar problem. “I think we have tremendous patent protection here,” Mr. Goldstein, the North Bridge partner, said, “and a very large lead on the rest of the market.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/24/2014, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Data Firm Actifio Hits $1 Billion Value Mark.

Foreign   In Our Pages: March 24. Advertisement 1914 : Lord Kitchener Hosts Ball at British Agency in Cairo CAIRO — The weather continues gloriously fine, although unusually warm for this time of the year. The hotels continue very full and many people are delaying their return to Europe. Among the most magnificent entertainments of the season undoubtedly was the ball given last night (St.Patrick’s Day) by Lord Kitchener at the British Agency. There must have been well over five hundred people present; but, owing to the attractions of the garden, the other suites of reception rooms and the supper tent, there was no congestion in the ballroom. Many a couple found much to marvel at in the fine furnishings of the reception rooms with their banks of roses, deliciously arranged groups of cut flowers, and wealth of art treasures of all descriptions — cabinets of priceless Venetian iridescent glass, Chinese lacquer, bronze Buddhas, carved ivories, alabaster vases, not to mention the wonderful specimens garnered since Lord Kitchener’s present tenure of office. 1964: Scientist Seeks Pill to Make Cigarette Smoking Safe PALM BEACH, Fla. — Dr. Charles Huggins says he has developed a pill that may prevent cancer caused by smoking. The future picture might be that of a smoker who would pop one or two pills into his mouth each morning along with his vitamins and puff away contentedly, free from fear of getting lung cancer 20 years later. Dr. Huggins, who told about the pill at an American Cancer Society seminar currently in progress here, warned, however that experiments have been performed only on animals. True, experiments performed on animals have a way of turning up false when attempted on human beings or even on some other species. Even if his pills did prevent cancer, Dr. Huggins admitted they would not control other illnesses that have been tied to the habit, like heart attacks and emphysema — the breathing trouble that comes from damaged lungs. Nevertheless, Dr. Huggins, director of the Ben May Laboratory for Cancer Research at the University of Chicago, has great optimism. The white-haired doctor, who smokes incessantly, said: “Cigarettes don’t cause cancer . . . it’s the smoke.”  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Society   Intervening Before Their Friends Could. Advertisement Advertisement By MARGAUX LASKEYMARCH 23, 2014 Rachel Liane Slaff, the daughter of Howard B. Slaff and Renée W. Slaff of Wilmington, Del., is to be married Sunday to Dr. David Jay Berman, the son of Debbie H. Berman and Dr. Mark S. Berman of Oradell, N.J. Rabbi Bradley Hercman will officiate at the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University Life at New York University. The couple met at N.Y.U., from which the groom graduated cum laude and the bride summa cum laude. The bride also received a master’s degree in new media and digital innovation there. The bride, 25, will continue to use her name professionally. In April, she is to become the social media manager at Forbes.com in New York. The bride’s father is the president and chief operating officer of Esschem, a manufacturer and supplier of custom acrylics for the dental, medical and cosmetics industries in Marcus Hook, Pa. Her mother retired as a preschool teacher at Temple Emanuel in Cherry Hill, N.J. The groom, 26, is a first-year anesthesiology resident at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. He received his medical degree with distinction in medical education from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Advertisement The groom’s mother is a part-time math tutor in New Jersey. His father is an orthopedic surgeon in private practice in Hackensack, N.J., and the vice chairman of orthopedic surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center. The couple met in August 2006 when Dr. Berman, then an orientation leader at N.Y.U. for the Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life, took Ms. Slaff and several other freshmen on a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. They started talking and became close friends. They remained so throughout undergraduate and graduate school. Acquaintances often told them they would make a great couple, but dating each other was not something they ever seriously considered. “We always say that we needed to be who we are,” Ms. Slaff said. “We needed to have each dated other people and gotten to become the people we are. He needed to finish medical school, and I was glad that I had him as a friend, but I’m not sure I had the emotional bandwidth to know where I wanted to go next in my life.” For Dr. Berman’s part, whenever the thought of asking her out crossed his mind, he quickly dismissed the notion. “I was a chicken because I didn’t think that this nice, smart, pretty Jewish girl would be interested in this awkward doofus doctor,” he said. In December 2012, mutual friends, convinced that they belonged together, decided to stage a lighthearted “intervention.” Their plan was to spur Mr. Berman into action by hanging poster-size pictures of Ms. Slaff in his apartment for him to discover when he arrived home from work. Ms. Slaff was mortified when she learned of the plan and decided, she said, “to intervene on the intervention.” A few days later, they were walking home from a get-together with friends, when Ms. Slaff nervously broached the subject. “Listen, it’s come to my attention that our friends think we should date,” she said. “Maybe we should talk about it.” They did, and after several hours of hashing out the risks of dating one’s best friend (“Dave majored in econ as an undergrad,” Ms. Slaff said, “so he’s quite the risk evaluator”), they decided to take the plunge and become a couple right then and there. They made the announcement to their friends at the synagogue the next day and had their first official date one week later. Dr. Berman said they have been practically inseparable ever since (with the exception of when he is on call). They were engaged last May. Advertisement “I knew from the moment I met her,” Dr. Berman said, “whoever ends up marrying her is going to be the luckiest dude alive.” MARGAUX LASKEY A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2014, on page ST21 of the New York edition with the headline: Intervening Before Their Friends Could.

Sports   Napier Takes Center Stage as UConn Upsets Villanova. Advertisement Advertisement By ZACH SCHONBRUNMARCH 23, 2014 BUFFALO — Connecticut led second-seeded Villanova by 5 with less than four minutes remaining Saturday, but Shabazz Napier — the Huskies’ best player and the team’s indisputable heart and soul — sat crumpled in a heap on the bench, his face buried in a towel. Napier winced as UConn’s trainer rubbed his right shin and ankle and the Huskies forged on without him. He checked back in with 3 minutes 22 seconds remaining, treading carefully. But the Huskies sure looked happy to have him on the court. Behind a gutsy performance by Napier, a senior who scored 25 points, seventh-seeded Connecticut upset Villanova, 77-65, in the East Region at First Niagara Center, moving on to the Round of 16 for the first time since 2011, when the Huskies won their last national championship. Napier was on that team, a dynamic role player who still needed a few years of seasoning. By Saturday, his time on center stage had arrived. Back in the game, still limping, Napier cut through a throng of defenders and made a layup, bringing UConn’s lead to 9 and his point total to 22. His face was flushed; he seemed barely able to move laterally. It did not matter. Advertisement “He’s just tough-minded,” Connecticut Coach Kevin Ollie said. “He does whatever we need to win.” On Friday, Ollie said Napier possessed a “moxie” from nearly the moment he stepped on campus, with Napier telling Kemba Walker at practice what he needed to do. Ollie may have been partly kidding. “He had a confidence, like I’m supposed to be here,” Ollie said Friday. Napier scored 4 points in the first half Saturday as Villanova controlled the opening minutes, building a 19-9 lead. But the Wildcats’ shooting ability let them down for a third consecutive game. Villanova went 11:24 without hitting a field goal as UConn went on a 16-1 run in the first half. Still, the Huskies went into halftime ahead by only 25-24. “We felt in good shape at halftime,” Wildcats Coach Jay Wright said. In the second half, Connecticut came out with more energy, hitting 7 of its first 12 shots from the field to hurry out to a 42-36 lead. After two 3-pointers by Napier, UConn led, 54-45, with less than five minutes remaining. A minute later, Napier went down, which seemed as if it might give Villanova a chance to close the gap. But Connecticut stalled enough to allow Napier some time for recovery, and he re-entered the game after only 36 seconds of playing time had elapsed. “I was trying to get open for the ball, and I think it was Hilliard that kneed me or kicked me in the shin,” Napier said, referring to Villanova’s Darrun Hilliard II. “The pain was excruciating.” Napier added that an athletic trainer “put that biofreeze on it, and I was ready to go.” The Wildcats shot just 35 percent from the field and were outscored, 26-5, off the bench. Despite a regular season with the most wins in program history (28), Villanova has yet to reach the Round of 16 since 2009.

Travel   Reflecting on a Writer’s Walk Through Europe. Advertisement Advertisement By KENAN CHRISTIANSENMARCH 21, 2014 From the time he was a boy, acclaimed travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor wanted to live like a character in a novel. Somehow, he found out how. During his lifetime, he was stabbed in Bulgaria, car-bombed in Greece, targeted in a blood vendetta, and hunted by German soldiers after kidnapping their commander on the island of Crete and handing him off to a waiting British submarine during World War II. But his story started in 1933, when at 18 he was focused on the single goal of walking across Europe, “From the hook of Holland to Constantinople.”  “This journey means more and more to him the older he gets; he realizes that in a funny way, it set the course of his life,” said Artemis Cooper, his biographer, who was an editor of Mr. Leigh Fermor’s third and final book about the trip — one that fans of the writer’s inimitable flare for whorling descriptions and evocative prose have waited nearly three decades to read. The story ended up being called “The Broken Road,” a reflection of the fact that the writer was unable to finish the book before his death in 2011. It ends in midsentence, with him still 500 miles short of his goal. Below are excerpts from a conversation with Cooper about Mr. Leigh Fermor, known affectionately as Paddy, and his adventurous walk. Q. When did Mr. Leigh Fermor first devise his trip across Europe? A. He was the kind of kid that makes all parents despair. When he was 18, he had finished school, but seemed absolutely unemployable. His father was this eminent geologist in India — one of the hardest-working people you could meet. And all of his friends would say, “Why can’t you be like your father?” But of course to Paddy, that just sounded like life imprisonment.   All he really wants to do is become a writer. Of course, he had nothing to write about and only produced the usual adolescent poetry that nobody wanted to read. At the time, he was in turmoil.  He was going to too many parties, having too many hangovers and on the inside he was completely miserable.  Then he describes that it just came to him from one moment to the next: He would walk across Europe. He traveled through Europe during a significant time in history.  Right, he crosses through Germany nine months after Hitler comes to power. At the time, Paddy wasn’t interested in politics or Nazidom, except that he recognized it as something hateful and extremely regimented, but the young Nazis were certainly interested in him.  They had heard about the Oxford anti-war debate, so for them, he represented an example of the young, decadent, Englishmen, who would not fight for king and country. During some of those clashes, Paddy tried explaining the anti-war movement that was happening within the younger generation in England, but of course that didn’t cut much ice. Paddy was more interested in writing about the hospitality he received, as he traveled further East to the more remote parts of Germany. For a child who had been born in 1915 and raised with a visceral sense of anti-German sentiment, he was amazed by how kind people were to him, by the generosity he was shown.  And this continues throughout his trip. Mr. Leigh Fermor seemed to have a natural gift for drawing out people’s hospitality. Oh yes, and they didn’t want him to go, no matter how many cigarette burns he left in the sheets.  He could put an incredible spell on people.  Part of it was he had the right kind of curiosity.  Even at the age of 18, he was extremely interested by the way the past enriches and leaks into the present: the way you can see it.  And these counts, living in their dusty old schlosses must have loved that. Here this kid comes along, hungry to know all about their family history: all the wars they had participated in and their great dynastic marriages. And suddenly, instead of seeing themselves as part of some washed up bit of broken empire, bang in the middle of nowhere, with the world moving very fast around them, their place in the world became this wonderful treasure house of history, with lineages stretching back past Charlemagne to the depths of time. Advertisement What else did he see? In Bulgaria, he encounters Islamic culture in person for the first time. He sleeps alternately in mosques, hayricks and grand estates, and meets wealthy barons and humble peasants in homespun clothing.  The Bulgarians tell him if he ever goes to Romania he’ll be attacked by wolves, bears and gypsies but, of course, that never happens.  Instead in Bucharest, he meshes with a lovely high-society crowd and goes to nightclubs and parties.  In Greece, he travels from monastery to monastery, picking up Greek from the monks.  And there he finds Mount Athos, the holy mountain. He wrote that only men were permitted to go there.  Yes, and not only is it only men, but no female animal is allowed there either.  You will only see roosters there, you will only see rams.  I don’t know how they control the cat population, realistically, I don’t think they do.  The reason for this is the mountain was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. As the story goes, if a woman tries to go to the island, she’ll see a terrifying vision of the Virgin Mary surrounded by flames saying, “Get out! There is another queen than thou!”  Paddy knows he finally left the holy mountain when he descends into a valley and spots a group of young girls playing in the fields. What did the journey mean to him?  Remember, most of what you’re reading is put together 30 years after the walk. At the time of the journey, he was a callow youth, and the descriptions he jotted down were quite pedestrian. It was only in hindsight, after a world war and the dark years of Communism, that he really was able to write what he felt about that particular swath of civilization.  Memory can be slippery stuff and sometimes it was hard for him to find the overarching voice that would somehow absorb the reality of the diary with what he’d written later on.  But what he’s created is this wonderful poetic vision that is lyrical, evocative, learned and all the things we love about him. Together, those books are a kind of love letter to Europe: the Europe that perhaps never existed but lies suspended somewhere between memory and imagination.

Business   In a Mischievous Manner. Advertisement By David Woolf Mar 25, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — This is New York Times puzzle number 2 for David Woolf, although he tells me that it was the first one Will Shortz accepted from him. That can happen sometimes; a constructor submits a number of puzzles in a row and some are accepted, but they might not necessarily run in the order in which they were received. Mr. Woolf made his debut last November and he’s back today attempting to prove one of the most difficult theories known to man, other than whether Justin Bieber is really as insufferable as he seems. Today’s puzzle tries to prove that sports adage, IT AIN’T OVER UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS (which is split between 17- and 57 Across) and, as proof, he offers the WALK-OFF HOMER from baseball and the BUZZER BEATER from basketball. Whether those really prove anything is something I’ll leave up to better minds than mine to decide, but I will say that I enjoyed this entry into our solving week. The solve was smooth, and I particularly enjoyed the clue “Baselessly off-base?” for AWOL. I also enjoyed SHISH KEBAB, FLOOZY and ZAFTIG. Not so much with the ENISLE (“Strand, in a way”), but that’s only one entry. Let’s talk to Mr. Woolf: My thoughts on this puzzle in list form: 1. This was my first puzzle accepted to the Times. 2. This is the second draft. The first had four theme answers, the other two being EMPTY NET (goal) and HAIL MARY (pass). While, if executed, these could potentially extend a game, they don’t necessarily trigger the end of a game. They also don’t imply success as the other two do. So they were rejected. 3. A lot of the grid shape was forced by crossing ZAFTIG with FAT LADY, which was too good to pass up. 4. Will Shortz changed two letters from the version I submitted. Can you guess what they are? 5. Happy March Madness and Opening Day! Nicely done, Mr. Woolf. Let’s funk it up a little in here and bop over to the Wednesday puzzle: Before I close, I just want to wish The Girl a very happy 19th birthday. You are beautiful inside and out, and as I always tell you, you are smarter and stronger than you even know right now. This is her first birthday away from home, but she is thriving in college, which makes this bittersweet for me. Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games.

Science   Guidelines May Double Statin Use. Advertisement New treatment guidelines for lowering cholesterol could result in nearly 13 million more adults being put on statins, researchers reported last week in The New England Journal of Medicine. Nearly half of people older than age 40 may end up taking the drugs, roughly doubling current usage. The revised guidelines, issued in November, shifted focus from specific cholesterol levels to a broader assessment of heart attack and stroke risk. The new analysis found the revisions could bring huge increases in the numbers of older adults without cardiovascular disease who would nonetheless be urged to consider statins. Among men 60 to 75, the percentage would jump to 87 percent from 30 percent; among older women, it would increase to 54 percent from 21 percent. Dr. Steven Nissen, chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said the report confirmed concerns that the new guidelines don’t target the right patients for treatment. “What we really need is to identify people in their 40s and 50s who are vulnerable, and initiate treatment in those people where the lifelong benefit is likely to be so much greater,” Dr. Nissen said.  He faulted the risk calculator that accompanies the new guidelines for not taking into account family history of coronary heart disease as a “powerful” risk factor. Still, the new analysis, which examined data from more than 3,700 people nationwide, estimated that “over 10 years with full uptake of the guidelines we are going to prevent almost half a million additional events,” said Michael Pencina, the lead author and the director of biostatistics at the Duke Clinical Research Institute. “That’s pretty good.” However, Dr. Pencina acknowledged, “we may be giving statins to a lot of people who don’t need them.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/25/2014, on page D7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Guidelines May Double Statin Use.

Sports   Johnson and Arizona Turn Back Gonzaga. Advertisement Advertisement By BILLY WITZMARCH 24, 2014 SAN DIEGO — David Stockton, as clever and wily as his Hall of Fame father, John, checked over his shoulder as he approached the basket. There was nobody ahead of him, he knew, but he looked to see who was lurking behind. When he saw that it was Nick Johnson, Stockton took a hesitation dribble, then laid the ball out in front of him, a move that John Stockton would use to elude and frustrate legions of shot blockers. It did not fool Johnson, the son of Jumping Joey Johnson, who took off like his father used to, and swatted the ball off the backboard as if the play were a setup. “We all saw it coming,” Arizona guard Gabe York said. “It was like LeBron.” The ease with which Johnson blocked the shot was also emblematic of the way No. 1 seed Arizona overwhelmed eighth-seeded Gonzaga, 84-61, on Sunday to secure a spot in the West Regional semifinal against fourth-seeded San Diego State on Thursday in Anaheim, Calif. The performance had to give pause to any Aztecs fans who were in attendance. “That’s the best team we’ve played, gosh, that I can remember,” said Gonzaga Coach Mark Few, whose team regularly plays one of the nation’s most challenging nonconference schedules. “They were just too much for us tonight.” Advertisement Johnson was far from the only high flier. If this tournament has been a disappointment for many of the star freshmen who are expected to leave for the N.B.A. after this season, with Jabari Parker of Duke and Andrew Wiggins of Kansas playing poorly in their teams’ losses this weekend, it was not so for Arizona’s Aaron Gordon. Gordon, an athletic and muscular 6-foot-9 forward, threw down rim-rattling, acrobatic dunks, and he was a defensive force on the perimeter and a willing passer. For good measure, he made a 3-pointer among his 18 points. He also had six rebounds, six assists and four steals in 23 minutes of play. Gonzaga, which calmly navigated Oklahoma State’s pressure defense in a comfortable victory, was on its heels from the start Sunday. It turned the ball over a season-high 21 times, and when Gordon dunked and was fouled by Sam Dower with 4 minutes 55 seconds left in the half, Arizona had a 43-22 lead. Gonzaga had a brief burst early in the second half, closing to 49-38 on a crafty post move by Przemek Karnowski. But Johnson hit a jumper and Gordon began a run with a steal, two assists and an emphatic dunk to restore the lead to 21. “Tonight was one of our season’s best performances,” said Arizona Coach Sean Miller, who joined his brother Archie Miller, the coach of Dayton, in the Round of 16. “The turnovers ignited our transition, and we’re always at our best when we can use our defense to our offense.” So dominant were the Wildcats that even their miscues were turned into highlights. When Gordon was stripped by Stockton, it set the stage for Johnson’s block. York thought Stockton would pump-fake. Stockton said he considered a reverse layup. Or getting his body into Johnson. Instead, he just offered up the ball. “That was a mistake,” he said. On this night, it was one of many that could not be avoided by Gonzaga. The Wildcats made a patient team look harried and a good-shooting team erratic. Arizona was that good, and from early on. Like Johnson lining up his block, it was not hard to see this one coming. A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2014, on page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Johnson and Arizona Turn Back Gonzaga.

Travel   Oil Spill Delays Cruise Departures. Advertisement Several cruises departing ports in Houston and Galveston have been delayed after a barge carrying almost one million gallons of bunker fuel oil collided with a bulk carrier ship in Galveston Bay, near Texas City, Tex., on Saturday. A ruptured tank on the barge spilled around 168,000 gallons of oil into the water, according to a release from the United States Coast Guard, which is working to contain and clean up the area. In the meantime, passage through ship channels in the region has been halted, leaving thousands of cruise passengers stuck in port and commercial vessels queuing up in long lines to exit the Gulf of Mexico. Three cruise ships — the Carnival Magic, the Carnival Triumph and Royal Caribbean’s Navigator of the Seas — were led from the gulf through the spill and back to their ports on Sunday and Monday morning, in order to allow passengers to disembark. But it is still uncertain when any future voyages, including that of Princess Cruises’ Caribbean Princess, which has been waiting in Houston with 3,354 passengers aboard since Saturday, would be allowed to depart. The Coast Guard said it was working to allow partial traffic through the area to resume. “We’re very sorry that this unfortunate incident has affected our passengers’ vacation plans, and we are currently looking at various itinerary scenarios based on a number of possible departure times,” Princess Cruises said in a statement on Sunday. Princess also noted that there was no official estimate of when that ship, scheduled for a seven-day cruise to Cozumel in Mexico, Roatan in Honduras, and Belize City in Belize, might be able to leave. “We will keep our passengers updated just as soon as we have anything concrete to share. In the meantime, they are on board the ship, which is operating a full entertainment, activity and dining schedule,” the statement said. Carnival Magic’s next voyage, originally scheduled to depart from Galveston on Sunday, is now expected to leave some time Monday afternoon, the company said in an email. The seven-day cruise will be shortened by one day, and guests who choose to sail will receive a prorated refund equal to one day of their cruise fare. The Carnival Triumph is being held at a cargo pier until the Magic departs, at which point it will shift to the passenger pier and commence debarkation. Triumph’s next voyage, a five-day cruise to Mexico, is scheduled to depart late on Monday and operate according to its regularly scheduled itinerary. Royal Caribbean’s Navigator of the Seas has already boarded passengers for its next voyage, which it expects will depart Galveston some time Monday afternoon as well, Cynthia Martinez, the director of the company’s global corporate communications, said in an email. If there are further delays to the seven-night voyage, guests will be compensated, she said, but the nature of the compensation will depend on how their cruise is affected.

Business   A Start-Up Is Offering an Online Way to Invest in Hollywood. Advertisement Thanks to new securities rules, Hollywood is about to get into the crowdfunding game. A start-up, Junction Investments, plans to open for business on Wednesday, allowing wealthy individuals to invest in movies alongside veteran film financiers. At the start, the company will offer an online chance to back “A Hologram for the King,” an adaptation of the Dave Eggers novel that will star Tom Hanks. Soon after, would-be mini-moguls will be able to invest in “Triple Nine,” a thriller featuring Kate Winslet, the “12 Years a Slave” star Chiwetel Ejiofor and Woody Harrelson. The start-up has already drawn a number of prominent backers and investors, including the casino billionaire Steve Wynn and the Internet entrepreneur Dave Morin. Junction represents the latest change brought about by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, whose passage in 2012 opened up new ways for companies to raise money. The law has already made it easier for companies to go public by eliminating a number of disclosure requirements. Perhaps its most notable change was that it blessed crowdfunding. Groups of so-called accredited investors — people who either make $200,000 a year or have a net worth of more than $1 million, excluding their home — can band together to buy up a company’s equity. With financing hard to raise, crowdfunding has become a buzzword in the movie business. Filmmakers have used sites like Kickstarter to raise money to start production, giving birth to movies like “Veronica Mars.” But Junction is taking a different tack, its founders say: The films it will back are already fully funded, and will be made regardless of how much the start-up raises. Any money raised through the site could be used either as an additional cushion or as a replacement for some of the Hollywood financiers’ original investment. Many in Hollywood worry that crowdfunding will open start-ups to lawsuits by unhappy investors. But Junction hopes to blunt that concern by giving investors the same terms as the seasoned financiers already involved in a movie. Kickstarter users, by contrast, are essentially donating to projects in return for rewards. “Investors aren’t being asked to put money into projects that more experienced financiers have already passed on,” Brian Goldsmith, a Junction co-founder and a former producer for “CBS Evening News,” said in a telephone interview. “Experienced investors already have skin in the game.” Prospective investors visiting the company’s website can read about coming projects — and wade through lengthy legal disclaimers — before deciding whether to invest. As to whether Junction investors will see their names in the movie credits, that will be up to each film’s backers. Junction took shape in the fall of 2012 when Mr. Goldsmith began brainstorming with Adam Kaufman, a friend and a former banker at Goldman Sachs, about new business opportunities. They hit on the idea of crowdfunding, then decided the entertainment industry would be a perfect start. Last November, the two went to the American Film Market, the conference in Santa Monica, Calif., where filmmakers make their pitches to prospective backers. In a crowded bar overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the two met with Christopher Woodrow and Molly Conners, the heads of the independent film studio Worldview Entertainment. “While most people were talking about foreign film rights, we were talking about the JOBS Act,” said Mr. Kaufman, Junction’s chief executive. But the Worldview executives quickly understood the business proposition, and by the end of the half-hour meeting, the two sides shook hands over a partnership, with “Triple Nine” serving as the studio’s first test. Besides Worldview and Silver Reel Entertainment, which is backing the Tom Hanks movie, other partners include Endgame Entertainment, PalmStar and QED International. Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Goldsmith soon hired a staff, including a former Google engineer, a onetime technology employee at Goldman and a former lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore. They also began to seek out advisers like Mr. Wynn and Logan Green, the chief executive of the car service Lyft. “They got it,” said Mr. Goldsmith, now Junction’s president. “We didn’t have to explain much.” Even though Junction has not yet funded its first movie, Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Goldsmith are already thinking of how to expand their business model beyond Hollywood. While the two will not discuss future plans, they said that the crowdfunding model could work elsewhere in the entertainment industry. “Within the film industry, we’re looking at a market of several billion dollars a year,” Mr. Kaufman said. “Outside of that, it’s a market of tens of billions of dollars.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/26/2014, on page B9 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Start-Up Is Offering an Online Way to Invest in Hollywood.

Travel   Cruises Resume Out of Texas. Advertisement Cruise ships in the Port of Galveston are getting underway again after a barge and bulk carrier ship collided in Galveston Bay on Saturday, creating a major oil spill and preventing ships from passing through the Houston Ship Channel into the Gulf of Mexico. As of Tuesday afternoon, the Carnival Magic was heading toward the gulf on a modified five-day itinerary with port calls in Cozumel and Grand Cayman, the company said in an email. (The cruise was initially scheduled for seven days.) Carnival’s Triumph was expected to get underway late Tuesday afternoon, the company said. Passengers who chose to proceed with either of these delayed cruises will receive a prorated refund for each day at sea missed, as well as a 25 percent discount on a future booking. Those who disembarked will receive the discount and a full refund. Royal Caribbean, whose Navigator of the Seas was scheduled to leave Galveston Sunday on a seven-day cruise, had canceled the voyage by Monday night. “We understand that this is not the news that our guests were hoping to hear and we share in their disappointment,” Cynthia Martinez, the director of global corporate communications, said in an email, adding that each passenger would receive a full refund and a credit of 25 percent of the fare paid for the voyage. Royal Caribbean also welcomed guests to stay aboard and enjoy the ship’s food and entertainment until March 30. Princess Cruises’ Caribbean Princess, which had been sitting in the Port of Houston with passengers aboard since Saturday, was able to depart Tuesday afternoon. Having lost two days of the original itinerary, the ship will now make one stop, in Cozumel on March 27, and return to port on March 29. Princess had already refunded passengers the full amount of the cruise, plus a goodwill credit of 25 percent of the cruise fare, Monday night, when the ship’s departure time was still uncertain. “These are disappointing and challenging circumstances that have been outside our control,” Princess said in a statement Monday, “and we truly appreciate our passengers’ patience and understanding.” In Transit is a blog on travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.

Business   Back to the Beginning. Advertisement By Jean O'Conor Mar 27, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. THURSDAY’S PUZZLES — There is a reason why I don’t write Numberplay, the weekly math puzzle blog, but when the math concepts infiltrate my crossword puzzles, I am forced to bite the bullet and do the research. It’s not like I remember these concepts from school. Fortunately, I really liked this puzzle by Jean O’Conor, rebuses and all, so it was well worth my time. Let’s see if I can bring this blog post FULL CIRCLE, which is part of Ms. O’Conor’s theme today. Before I even realized that this puzzle was a rebus, I stumbled on 38 Down. Hands up (with me) if you automatically thought of TEXAS — which doesn’t fit — for the clue “Southernmost state”. Turns out that there are actually states outside the United States, did you know that? It’s true. Today, Ms. O’Conor and Will Shortz are thinking of TASMANIA. I can honestly say I didn’t see that one coming. Football (soccer to Americans) and cricket are both very popular sports in TASMANIA. The balls used in these sports are spherical, but one could trace a CIRCLE with them. The circumference of a CIRCLE can be measured using the formula “2 PI R” and the area of that same CIRCLE can be measured using the formula “PI R SQUARED”. (While we’re cruising this circle, let’s all stop for a moment and admire how Ms. O’Conor was able to cross those formulas with lively entries like “LIFE OF PI”, SQUARED AWAY and “MAGNUM P.I.”) You know what’s SQUARE? Boxing rings. (I know. Rings are round. Not boxing rings, though.) “Clay pounder?” is a very clever clue for Sonny LISTON. Speaking of clever clues, I also liked “Shirker of one’s duties?” for TAX EVADER and the tremendously fun “Do-si-do whoop-de-dos” for HOEDOWNS. Of course, if you’re going to dance, one would hope that you were being SERENADED, which would at least make it worth your while. Not only that, but the dance of SEDUCERS is purportedly the tango, which, of course, originated in TASMANIA. O.K., maybe it’s not a perfect circle, but it’s close. Let’s catch up with Ms. O’Conor: This puzzle began at Positive Pie, a restaurant in the very small town of Hardwick, Vt. It’s known for its delicious pizza served from a wood-fired oven and for its selection of craft beers. While anticipating both of these pleasures, and studying the menu decorated with its design of +’s and π’s, my husband started the discussion of pizza/pie/pi theme ideas. The pizza pie piece eventually fell by the wayside, except for its circular shape. The puzzle went through some revisions of the fill, during which FULL got moved around a lot. I hadn’t realized what a hard word it was to “fill” around! I have to thank Will for livening up my clues. I was glad to see two of my favorites still there (for SERENADE and HOEDOWNS), but I can’t take any credit for “It wraps around a chest at the beach”! Hope you enjoy the π. Indeed we did, Ms. O’Conor. Your thoughts? Updated, 8:55 a.m. | In an earlier version of this post, I had written that the area of a circle is “2 PI R” and the circumference is “PI R SQUARED”. Thanks to alert readers, I was reminded that it’s the opposite, and I’ve fixed it in my post. Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.  Deb Amlen is a humorist and puzzle constructor whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Onion and Bust Magazine. Her books, “It's Not P.M.S., It's You” and “Create Your Life Lists” are available where all fine literature is sold. Numberplay is a puzzle suite that will be presented in Wordplay every Monday. The puzzles, which are inspired by many sources and are reported by Gary Antonick, are generally mathematical or logical problems, with occasional forays into physics and other branches of science. While written for adults, many of the concepts here are suitable for and can be enjoyed by math students of all ages. Gary Antonick, who has created or edited over 100 logic and math puzzles for The New York Times, secretly believes every math problem can be solved using circles and straight lines.

Foreign   Fissures in China’s Ethnic Policy. Advertisement The Chinese man spying on the daughter of a prominent political prisoner at the United Nations in Geneva last week probably didn’t expect to be expelled from the international body. But the United Nations stripped him of his pass as a representative of the China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetan Culture, a group tied to the Communist Party’s United Front Work Department. The association was accredited as a nongovernmental organization at the Human Rights Council meeting where the incident took place, but his behavior didn’t conform to what most people think of when they think of NGOs. He photographed Ti-Anna Wang and her laptop screen in what United Nations officials deemed ‘‘intimidation and harassment.’’ The almost amateur espionage involving a camera device hidden inside the man’s coat — Ms. Wang, who was there to testify about her imprisoned father, Wang Bingzhang, said in an interview she found it intimidating but also silly — prompted a prominent scholar of Tibet to see it as a reflection of deeper questions facing the United Front, long highly influential in ethnic policy in regions such as Tibet and Xinjiang but losing influence as violence there spirals. ‘‘This is symbolic, but it’s often symbolic issues that are crucial in the rise and fall of Chinese policies and politicians,’’ said Robert J. Barnett, director of the Modern Tibet Studies Program at Columbia University. ‘‘I think this is a large crack in the wall that the United Front has built around itself from a lot of internal pressures it’s under now since the disasters of 2008 in Tibet and 2009 in Xinjiang, and now Kunming,’’ Mr. Barnett said. He was referring to two eruptions of violence involving Tibetans and Uighurs, and a knife attack in a train station in February in which the attackers — the government says they were from Xinjiang — killed 29 people. Scores of self-immolations in Tibetan areas and regular clashes between Uighurs and security forces in Xinjiang, present a picture of worsening relations between the ethnic Han majority and the two most politically sensitive minorities. Have these events led China’s leaders to question existing ethnic policies? Yes, said James Leibold, a political historian and ethnicity specialist at La Trobe University in Australia, in an interview. ‘‘There is a perception of rising ethnic problems,’’ he said. And under the new administration of Xi Jinping, ‘‘There’s a bit of a turf war over ethnic policy.’’ Said Mr. Barnett, ‘‘We know that the leadership is being talked to by a lot of advisers saying, ‘You should do things this way,’ and that debate is happening, and it didn’t happen before.’’ One view, associated with Ma Rong, a sociology professor at Peking University, argues for assimilation: remove the ethnic identification from identity cards, end affirmative action for education and birth quotas, make everyone ‘‘Chinese’’ just as everyone in the United States is American. Black people in the United States don’t agitate for a separate country, is the thinking, Mr. Barnett said. The government has been too generous, and that’s the reason for the violence, runs this view. Said Mr. Leibold, ‘‘It seems that Xi right now is trying to take an ideological approach,’’ by emphasizing ‘‘the importance of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.’’ The department was long charged with winning ‘‘middle elements’’ for the Communist cause. Ethnic minorities were a key target. It also identified ‘‘diehard elements,’’ or enemies of Communism. For publicly calling for her father’s release, Ms. Wang could be seen as one. With the United Front weakening, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission may have a growing say in policy. But increasingly important is Yu Zhengsheng, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the scholars said. In 2013 Mr. Xi made Mr. Yu head of the party ‘‘leading small group’’ on Tibet and Xinjiang. ‘‘Real policy-making power flows through individuals and their patronage networks rather than bureaucratic organs, suggesting the bureaucratic turf war over ethnic policy will continue,’’ Mr. Leibold said. Sinosphere, the China blog of The New York Times, delivers intimate, authoritative coverage of the planet's most populous nation and its relationship with the rest of the world. Drawing on timely, engaging dispatches from The Times’ distinguished team of China correspondents, this blog brings readers into the debates and discussions taking place inside a fast-changing country and details the cultural, economic and political developments shaping the lives of 1.3 billion people.

Science   Exercising for Healthier Eyes Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. Age-related vision loss is common and devastating. But new research suggests that physical activity might protect our eyes as we age. There have been suggestions that exercise might reduce the risk of macular degeneration, which occurs when neurons in the central part of the retina deteriorate. The disease robs millions of older Americans of clear vision. A 2009 study of more than 40,000 middle-aged distance runners, for instance, found that those covering the most miles had the least likelihood of developing the disease. But the study did not compare runners to non-runners, limiting its usefulness. It also did not try to explain how exercise might affect the incidence of an eye disease. So, more recently, researchers at Emory University in Atlanta and the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center in Decatur, Ga., took up that question for a study published last month in The Journal of Neuroscience. Their interest was motivated in part by animal research at the V.A. medical center. That work had determined that exercise increases the levels of substances known as growth factors in the animals’ bloodstream and brains. These growth factors, especially one called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or B.D.N.F., are known to contribute to the health and well-being of neurons and consequently, it is thought, to improvements in brain health and cognition after regular exercise. But the brain is not the only body part to contain neurons, as the researchers behind the new study knew. The retina does as well, and the researchers wondered whether exercise might raise levels of B.D.N.F. there, too, potentially affecting retinal health and vision. To test that possibility, the researchers gathered adult, healthy lab mice. Half of these were allowed to remain sedentary throughout the day, while the other animals began running on little treadmills at a gentle rodent pace for about an hour a day. After two weeks, half of the mice in each group were exposed to a searingly bright light for four hours. The other animals stayed in dimly lit cages. This light exposure is a widely used and accepted means of inducing retinal degeneration in animals. It doesn’t precisely mimic the slowly progressing disease in humans, obviously. But it causes a comparable if time-compressed loss of retinal neurons. The mice then returned to their former routine — running or not exercising — for another two weeks, after which the scientists measured the number of neurons in each animal’s eyes. The unexercised mice exposed to the bright light were experiencing, by then, severe retinal degeneration. Almost 75 percent of the neurons in their retinas that detect light had died. The animals’ vision was failing. But the mice that had exercised before being exposed to the light retained about twice as many functioning retinal neurons as the sedentary animals; in addition, those cells were more responsive to normal light than the surviving retinal neurons in the unexercised mice. Exercise, it seems, had armored the runners’ retinas. Separately, the researchers had other mice run or sit around for two weeks, and then measured levels of B.D.N.F. in their eyes and bloodstreams. The runners had far more. Tellingly, when the scientists injected still other mice with a chemical that blocks the uptake of the growth factor before allowing them to run and exposing them to the bright light, their eyes deteriorated as badly as among sedentary rodents. When the mice could not process B.D.N.F., exercise did not safeguard their eyes. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that “exercise protects vision, at least in mice, by increasing B.D.N.F. in the retina,” said Jeffrey Boatright, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Emory University School of Medicine and a co-author of the study. But obviously, mice are not people, so whether exercise can prevent or ameliorate macular degeneration in human eyes is “impossible to know, based on the data we have now,” said Machelle Pardue, a research career scientist at the Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center, who is the senior author of the study. She and her colleagues are trying to find ways to determine the impact of exercise on human eyes. But such experiments will take years to return results. For now, she and Dr. Boatright said, people who are concerned about their vision, and especially those with a family history of retinal degeneration, might want to discuss an exercise program with their doctor. “As potential treatments go,” she said, “it’s cheap, easy and safe.” Dr. Boatright agreed, adding that eye researchers have been trying for some time to find a way to externally deliver growth factors or drugs to aging eyes, but the available methods typically involve injections into the retina, a process that is complicated, chancy, pricey, and fundamentally objectionable. Now, though, “it’s beginning to look like we may have this other method” — exercise — “that costs almost nothing and results in you making your own growth factors, which is so much safer and more pleasant than having a needle stuck into your eyeball,” he said, getting no disagreement from me.

Travel   A Charleston Hotel With an Interest in Building. Advertisement When Belmond Charleston Place invites its guests to get plastered, they’re not talking about hitting the bar. The luxury hotel is offering a Charleston Building Arts Package that includes a two-night stay with a hands-on plaster lesson at the American College of the Building Arts and admission for two to the 1808 Nathaniel Russell House to see examples of plasterwork and other traditional building arts. Guests will begin by touring the downtown school, billed as the only liberal arts college in the country teaching traditional building arts, to learn about each of the trades taught there, including plasterwork, masonry, stone carving, timber framing, ironworking and carpentry. Then they’ll join students for an opportunity to create plasterwork as it has been done for hundreds of years, making castings (pouring plaster into molds to create designs), creating and shaping intricate crown molding and even building a plaster souvenir to take home. The arts package, starting at $380 per night, includes a plaster lesson for one (additional lesson at $150), admission for two to the Nathaniel Russell House, two nights’ accommodation and breakfast for two daily. Plaster lessons, and some additional college sessions, are available Tuesday through Thursday mornings until April 17 (fall package dates will become available.).

Business   Extreme Piques. Advertisement By David J. Kahn Mar 28, 2014 The New York Times Crossword is available through subscription only. FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — We have a Friday puzzle with a little something extra. David J. Kahn is back, and he has stuck an endorsement for the movie “CAPTAIN PHILLIPS” smack in the middle of the grid, so we have a minitheme today. Not only do we have the 15-letter CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stretching across the grid, but we also have his captors, the SOMALI PIRATES crossing him at 16 Down. Mr. Kahn’s puzzle is a near-whop, with 11 unique entries, and it’s quite open for a 72-word puzzle, isn’t it? Besides the minitheme, I really liked LOSE ONE’S MARBLES, ALEXANDER CALDER (I can still remember learning about his kinetic sculptures in art class), TRILBY (a hat with a mellifluous name), and SOURCES OF INCOME, which sounds kind of contrived, but is crunchy nonetheless. I also liked BUMMERS, BLIMEY, BLUE CHIPS, ALL SET and KLEBAN. Add to that the double stacks near the top and bottom of the grid and BLIMEY, this is a fun puzzle. For my money, Clue of the Day goes to 1 Across’s “Those who respond to pickup lines?” for CABBIES. That’s a lot funnier if you live or work in a big city and have to stand in line for a cab. Let’s hear from Mr. Kahn: I loved the Tom Hanks movie and decided to write a Friday puzzle with a minitheme after seeing that CAPTAIN PHILLIPS crosses SOMALI PIRATES in the middle of the grid. I also decided to include four more 15-letter answers and that’s why there are relatively few black squares in this, a 72-word puzzle. Nicely done, Mr. Kahn. Your thoughts? Welcome to our conversation about word games. Here you'll find a new blog post for each day's crossword plus a bonus post for the Variety puzzle. Along with discussion about the day's challenge, you'll get backstage insights about puzzlemaking and occasional notes from The Times's puzzlemaster, Will Shortz.  Deb Amlen is a humorist and puzzle constructor whose work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Onion and Bust Magazine. Her books, “It's Not P.M.S., It's You” and “Create Your Life Lists” are available where all fine literature is sold. Numberplay is a puzzle suite that will be presented in Wordplay every Monday. The puzzles, which are inspired by many sources and are reported by Gary Antonick, are generally mathematical or logical problems, with occasional forays into physics and other branches of science. While written for adults, many of the concepts here are suitable for and can be enjoyed by math students of all ages. Gary Antonick, who has created or edited over 100 logic and math puzzles for The New York Times, secretly believes every math problem can be solved using circles and straight lines. He is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, where he studies mathematical problem solving.
