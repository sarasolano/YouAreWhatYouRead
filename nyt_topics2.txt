Foreign   North Korean Leader Says He Wants Better Ties With South. Advertisement Advertisement By CHOE SANG-HUNDEC. 31, 2013 SEOUL, South Korea — The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, on Wednesday called for improving relations with South Korea and boasted of his regime’s tightened grip on power in his first public speech since the purge and execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, last month. “North and South Korea should create a mood to improve relations,” Mr. Kim said in a nationally televised New Year’s Day speech. “It’s time to end useless slandering, and the North and the South should no longer do things that harm reconciliation and harmony.” Mr. Kim began delivering a New Year’s Day speech after coming to power two years ago, reviving the practice of his grandfather Kim Il-sung. During the rule of his reclusive father, Kim Jong-il, the country’s main state-run newspapers issued a joint editorial to mark the day. Analysts waited for this year’s speech with unusual interest because it would be the first since the purge of Mr. Jang, long considered Mr. Kim’s mentor and the regime’s No. 2 figure. Mr. Jang was executed on Dec. 12 on charges of building a faction within the ruling Workers’ Party in a plot to overthrow Mr. Kim’s government. “We took decisive actions to remove factional filth,” Mr. Kim said Wednesday in an apparent reference to the purge of Mr. Jang and his associates. “Our party has tightened its revolutionary ranks by making a timely decision to ferret out and purge the anti-party, anti-revolutionary factional clique.” Advertisement The purge was the biggest political upheaval in North Korea in recent years. Some analysts have said it indicated the further consolidation of Mr. Kim’s rule. But others speculated that he had failed to establish the kind of absolute authority that his father and grandfather wielded and that the purge signaled a power struggle in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. South Korean policy-makers have warned that North Korea may attempt military provocations against the South to build internal unity after the domestic political trouble. In his speech, Mr. Kim repeated his government’s traditional condemnation of the United States and South Korea for conducting war games on the divided Korean Peninsula. The exercises “created a situation where a trifle military skirmish can spread into a full-blown war,” he said. “If there is another war on this land, it will bring about a nuclear catastrophe, and the United States won’t escape it, either.” Mr. Kim had also called for an end to “confrontation” with South Korea during his last New Year speech, after his country launched a rocket in December 2012. Washington condemned it as a test of long-range missile technology. Mr. Kim’s government further raised tensions by conducting its third underground nuclear test in February. In most of the first half of 2013, the North issued a torrent of threats of missile and nuclear attacks at South Korea, the United States and its bases around the Pacific. But it has since expressed a willingness to re-engage in dialogue. Under Mr. Kim, North Korea adopted the simultaneous development of the economy and the nuclear weapons program as a key party line. Yet years of tightening sanctions have made reviving the moribund economy even harder. South Korean intelligence officials said Mr. Jang’s purge was partly the result of a factional struggle over the spoils of the country’s few sources of foreign currency, like exports of coal. On Wednesday, Mr. Kim echoed the themes of previous New Year messages, emphasizing that improving the living standards of North Koreans and rejuvenating agriculture were main priorities. But he also reiterated a call for strengthening the military through the development of advanced weapons like drones. North Korea has often called for improved ties with the South in its New Year messages. It hopes for the return of billions of dollars of South Korean investment, aid and trade, which had flowed during an era of reconciliation between 1998 and 2008. South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, a conservative, says her nation will not provide aid until the North wins the South’s “trust” by moving toward denuclearization.

Science   Navigating Our World Like Birds and Bees Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. African tribesmen walk through their landscape in a pattern that eerily echoes the movements of scavenging birds, flocking insects, gliding sharks and visitors to Disneyland, a new study finds, suggesting that aspects of how we choose to move around in our world are deeply hard-wired. For the new study, which appeared online recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Arizona at Tucson, Yale University, the New York Consortium in Evolutionary Primatology and other institutions traveled to northern Tanzania to study the Hadza, who are among the last human hunter-gatherers on earth. The Hadza generally spend their days following game and foraging for side dishes and condiments such as desert tubers and honey, frequently walking and jogging for miles in the process. The ways in which creatures, including people, navigate their world is a topic of considerable scientific interest, but one that, until the advent of global positioning systems and similar tracking technology, was difficult to quantify. In the past decade, however, scientists have begun strapping GPS units to many varieties of animals and insects, from bumblebees to birds, and measuring how they move. What they have found is that when moving with a purpose such as foraging for food, many creatures follow a particular and shared pattern. They walk (or wing or lope) for a short time in one direction, scouring the ground for edibles, then turn and start moving in another direction for a short while, before turning and strolling or flying in another direction yet again. This is a useful strategy for finding tubers and such, but if maintained indefinitely brings creatures back to the same starting point over and over; they essentially move in circles. So most foragers and predators occasionally throw in a longer-distance walk (or flight), which researchers refer to as a “long step,” bringing them into new territory, where they then return to short walks and frequent turns as they explore the new place. This particular motion pattern was first scientifically identified in 1999 among scavenging albatrosses and termed a Levy flight or walk (named, for obscure reasons, after Paul Levy, a French mathematician). Since then, researchers have discerned the same pattern in bumblebees, sharks, fly fishermen trawling a river and people at amusement parks, who sample one portion of the facility in depth before ambling off to remoter rides. But while the pattern was instinctual in animals and insects, it was not clear whether Levy-style movement was natural to humans or occurred in modern times almost by happenstance, because of how we built our cities and amusement parks. So the scientists turned to the Hadza, who still live much as humans did millennia ago. They outfitted 44 of the tribespeople with GPS watches and asked them to hunt and gather for several days while wearing the units. The resulting data showed that the tribespeople frequently employed the Levy walk, moving briefly in one direction, then shifting and covering nearby ground, until that area was exhausted of potential food, at which point they’d set off on a longer-distance hike to new ground and there begin the short explorations again. This finding has surprising relevance, even for those of us whose food is arrayed in grocery aisles, said David Raichlen, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona who led the study. The GPS readings reinforce the likelihood that Levy-style walking patterns are hard-wired into the human brain and predict how we behave. Even before this study was published, he said, planners in some cities had used the theory that people Levy-walk — spending much of their time exploring one area, with occasional “long steps” or forays into another part of a city — to determine where to place cellphone towers. At a more individual level, he said, the discovery may help to explain why, after spending hours in a small, familiar office, many of us feel an itch to wander the halls in search of new geography. But the most resonant implication of the study, Dr. Raichlen said, is that Levy walking patterns bind modern, urban humans to the natural world. “This pattern” of movement “emerges so often in so many different species and human societies,” he said. “It links us” to the flight of the albatross and to an ancient part of ourselves, even when we’re strolling toward Disney’s Tomorrowland.

Business   Talk Radio on WABC Shifts Focus to the Local. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN SISARIOJAN. 2, 2014 In the war over talk radio in New York, WABC is going local. WABC-AM (770), which is owned by Cumulus Media, will introduce a new lineup on Thursday that emphasizes live and local programming, as its two most popular hosts, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, move to a rival station, WOR-AM (710). Weekday programming at WABC will include the return of Curtis Sliwa’s and Ron Kuby’s show, “Curtis and Kuby,” from noon to 3 p.m., after an absence of more than six years, and, starting Monday, a one-hour program at 5 p.m. with Pat Kiernan, the NY1 television anchor. Geraldo Rivera, who joined WABC in early 2012, will turn his focus to New York news in a two-hour live show at 10 a.m., as Cumulus announced in November. Michael Savage’s syndicated program, which has been heard in the evenings, will now run from 3 to 5 p.m. “Imus in the Morning,” with Don Imus, will continue from 6 to 10 a.m. “We’re delivering on our pledge to invest in localized content that will entertain, inform and engage listeners while also providing advertisers unique opportunities to reach their customers on a sustained basis,” John Dickey, Cumulus’s co-chief operating officer, said in a statement. The changes come as Cumulus tries to build its programming chest to compete against Clear Channel, whose 850 stations include WOR. Once a small player in the radio industry, Cumulus expanded greatly in 2011 when it bought Citadel Broadcasting for $2.5 billion, and it now operates about 460 stations. Advertisement Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Hannity, whose shows are syndicated to hundreds of stations by Clear Channel’s Premiere Networks division, are by far the country’s most popular talk hosts, and their combined presence helped make WABC the dominant talk outlet in New York. Talkers, a trade magazine, estimates that Mr. Limbaugh reaches more than 14 million listeners each week and Mr. Hannity 13.25 million. Last year, however, Cumulus executives said millions of dollars were lost after advertisers withdrew from the shows, largely in response to Mr. Limbaugh’s ridicule of Sandra Fluke, an advocate of insurance coverage for birth control. Mr. Limbaugh’s and Mr. Hannity’s shows left WABC at the end of 2013 as a result of complex negotiations between Cumulus and Clear Channel. Mr. Hannity’s show was dropped from dozens of Cumulus stations, while the syndication contract for Mr. Limbaugh was renewed at most stations, but discontinued at WABC. In New York, their shows are now heard on WOR. “Curtis and Kuby,” which ran on WABC from 2000 to late 2007, will now compete against Mr. Limbaugh, and Mr. Savage’s show will be up against Mr. Hannity. While none of the new figures on WABC have followings on the scale of WOR’s syndicated hosts, Cumulus is betting on the appeal of locally focused content to draw New York listeners. Mr. Kiernan, who is on NY1 each weekday morning, said his show, which will include a co-host who has not been named, would be a recap of the major news and pop culture events of the day. He also emphasized the importance of local programming on the radio, as stations compete not only against one another but also against an ocean of media online. “In an era when listeners can go off in so many different directions,” Mr. Kiernan said, “local is something you can’t take away from people.” A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2014, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Talk Radio on WABC Shifts to Local.

Foreign   Delhi’s New Chief Minister Strikes a Chord With the People. Advertisement Advertisement By MANU JOSEPHJAN. 2, 2014 NEW DELHI — In Delhi’s winter, the practicality of warm clothes ensures that even the poor do not seem as austere as they do in other seasons. But the capital’s new chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, has somehow managed to maintain his perennial simplicity even at the risk of looking somewhat ridiculous. Part of his attire this winter is a scarf below his customary white oval cap. A comment on my Facebook page described him as looking like an Emirates flight attendant. But the nation is fascinated by him. Never before in modern India have the elite and the poor agreed on a political matter, but now there is a consensus that Mr. Kejriwal is a hero of these times. Long an agitator who chiefly targeted political corruption, he contested the Delhi state elections, and on Saturday was sworn in as its seventh chief minister. He rode the subway to the swearing-in ceremony. He has declined state security cover and the sprawling official residence. His Aam Admi Party, or A.A.P., which had initially planned to contest about 100 of the 545 seats in the impending general elections to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is now considering contesting about 300 seats. The previous general elections, in 2009, were contested by more than 350 political parties representing scores of regional, communal and social interests. The strategy of A.A.P. is to be the mother ship of numerous citizens’ pressure groups and mass movements across the country. It plans to broaden its mission beyond fighting political corruption and endear itself to those who want to cast a vote against a variety of government policies. Mr. Kejriwal’s triumph is a point in time in the evolution of both elite and mass protests in India, an evolution that has been accelerated by economics, technology and the intoxicating comforts of feudalism, which have long ensured that the rich, in many ways, have a better life in India than in developed nations. These factors have resulted in the urban middle class becoming increasingly interested in the nation’s political destiny. As recently as 2007, there was something comical about how the urban Indian middle class protested. They usually carried sunblock and stood holding placards in English. It was as if they were not protesting so much as talking to each other. Mass protests, at the time, were festive outings with jovial protesters often waving to television cameras. There were also, of course, very serious protests by the poor, but their marches seldom interested the mainstream news media. Advertisement But something else was going on. The middle-class enchantment with escaping to the affluent West was coming to an end. Even as India’s elite was prospering, the West was going through hard times. Then, in 2008, 10 terrorists from Pakistan attacked South Mumbai, a refuge of the rich. Mumbai’s elite erupted in anger, blaming the politicians they criticized as not being competent enough to protect them. When a politician came to pay his respects to the dead, he was driven away by a group of college students. This was unprecedented in Mumbai. In the general elections that followed, Meera Sanyal, a banker whose close friend had died in the attack, ran as a candidate from the Mumbai South constituency. Ms. Sanyal received extraordinary media coverage, and was impressive when she spoke of her plans, but she fared poorly in the election. It appeared that the educated urban middle class would never be able to influence Indian politics, even with the news media on its side. The middle-class revolt revived in 2011 as the global economy sank further. After a series of high-profile political scandals and a mass movement against the political class, Mr. Kejriwal emerged as a hero of the poor and the miserable. He was a beneficiary of middle-class anger against politicians, and the news media made him a national figure, but his success lay in realizing that the voters, who are mostly poor, mattered more.

Science   Lentil and Carrot Salad With Middle Eastern Spices. Advertisement Advertisement Recipes for Health By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN DEC. 30, 2013 I combined two of my favorite Mediterranean salads to stretch the cup of lentils I had in my pantry. Take care not to overcook the lentils; they should be slightly al dente. They go quickly from al dente to mushy, so make sure to check after 25 minutes. 1 cup brown or green lentils, washed and picked over 1 bay leaf Salt to taste 5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 2 to 3 large garlic cloves (to taste), minced 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, lightly toasted and ground 3/4 teaspoon coriander seeds, ground 1/4 teaspoon cardamom seeds, ground 3/4 pound carrots, peeled and thinly sliced 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice Freshly ground pepper to taste 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 1. Place the lentils in a medium saucepan, cover by 1 inch with water, add the bay leaf and bring to a boil. Add salt to taste, reduce the heat and cook just until the lentils are al dente, about 25 minutes. Advertisement 2. Meanwhile, combine 3 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic in a small frying pan or saucepan over medium heat. When the garlic begins to sizzle, add the spices. Stir together for about 30 seconds, then remove from the heat and transfer to a large bowl. 3. While the lentils are simmering, steam the carrots for 8 to 10 minutes, until tender. Remove from the heat and transfer to the bowl with the garlic and spices. Add the lemon juice and salt to taste and toss together. 4. When the lentils are cooked al dente, set a strainer over a bowl, drain the lentils and toss at once with the carrots. If desired, add some of the broth to moisten. Add cilantro and another tablespoon of olive oil and toss together. Add freshly ground pepper, taste and adjust salt.

Travel   A Winter Weekend in the North Fork. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 2, 2014 It’s free to watch the sun set over the wetlands that fringe the causeway connecting East Marion and Orient, near the eastern tip of Long Island’s North Fork. If the weather has been dry enough in this wine country just across the bay from the Hamptons, there’s a good perch on the marshy land near Latham Farms, by a little cabin on stilts known locally as the crab shack. The wine is also free, if your friend Jeanny Pak happens to have brought along a bottle of malbec and some plastic cups without telling you. There’s only one catch: sunsets tend to take place right around nightfall, which means you’ll also need a place to sleep. The price for that can vary widely over the course of a year in a spot this seasonal. The Greenporter Hotel in cute little Greenport Village, for example, charges $119 plus tax ($133) for its cheapest room on winter weekends; in July 2014, it will be $309 plus tax ($345). Affordable lodging and a lack of crowds were my primary motivations for heading to the East End on a winter weekend. And something about the Yelp reviews made me suspect I was going to like the Greenporter: “Dumpy motel lying and masquerading as a boutique hotel.” “About as much charm as a white padded room.” “I mean, come on guys, not for nearly $300 a night.” There, in that last one, did you catch it? Fussy online hotel reviews are easy enough for unfussy travelers like me to ignore; when the reviewers paid more than twice what you plan to, they mean practically nothing at all. In fact Jeanny, whom I invited as stand-in girlfriend in part because she has far higher standards than I, had no complaints — the overhauled former motel had a decent bed, working Internet and a bathroom with a timed heater (great for winter mornings). Just a clean, private room with hot water is generally enough for me; a flat-screen TV and a front desk that printed out hiking paths (and later, promptly mailed back an item left behind) were bonuses. There’s even a smidgen of style — a whitewash treatment alone is enough to transform the vibe from old to retro — and a decent free breakfast. Sure, if I had paid $345, I’d expect a lot more — like to be fired from this column for dereliction of duty. You also don’t need a car to get there — it’s a five-minute walk from the Greenport Long Island Rail Road and Hampton Jitney bus stop. Jeanny had driven us out there early Saturday morning, but she left early Sunday; I would stay for the day and take one of the frequent jitneys back, $19 to Manhattan. Advertisement Heading to a summer spot in the winter, of course, has its downsides. You can’t jump in the water and for after-dark excitement, you’ll have to turn to a John Grisham novel. But lines are nonexistent, and service tends to be impeccable, as you’ve got the full attention of servers and hotel clerks. Advertisement Having a car does have its advantages; if we hadn’t driven, we wouldn’t have stopped for an early lunch at Taqueria Mexico in Riverhead, the last town before Long Island splits. One thing you can count on from wealthy vacation areas is restaurants for immigrant workers somewhere on the periphery. Jeanny began her Frugal Traveler career by absolutely schooling me on ordering: she ordered one chicken tostada ($2) and asked our diminutive Guatemalan server to add beef to a $1.50 meatless tostada, for which we were charged an extra 50 cents. (My $8 order of three pathetic bean and cheese sopes for $8 was half as good for twice the price.) Once lodging is taken care of, the only danger of blowing the budget in the North Fork is the temptation of the pricey, local-ingredient-obsessed restaurants. Having sensed danger on the drive out when Jeanny had asked, “Where are we having dinner?” I decided to forestall any evening splurges with a snack-as-we-went approach. There were those tostadas, a $4 bag of six still-warm cider doughnuts at Wickham’s Fruit Farm (now closed for the season), three homemade pickles for $3 at Goodale Farms and a portion of black bean and grass-fed beef chili with blue corn tortilla chips for $10 from the food truck behind the fancy North Fork Table & Inn. In between, we fit in a visit to Horton’s Point Lighthouse (though you can’t enter in the winter), a walk on a nearby beach and a wine tasting at Lenz Winery, which we split for a $10 and which included four wines, including its well-regarded gewürztraminer. Once again beating me at my own game, Jeanny managed to weasel a fifth taste out of our server. We tried to go see the sunset from Orient Beach State Park, which hangs by a ligament off the tip of the North Fork, but the park closed at 4; a worker there directed us to the causeway, which turned out to be perfect. The evening was young, but night life expectancy is short during North Fork winters, so after dropping off our bags, we hurried over to catch the tail end of the 5 to 7 p.m. weekend happy hour at the Winemaker Studio in Peconic, a combination tasting room, bar and wine shop. Pours were 30 percent off, and we took advantage, ordering normally $7 glasses of a blend of reds from Suhru Wines in Mattituck. On advice from our server, we decided to end the evening with a drink at the bar at First and South, a fancy-ish restaurant back in Greenport. We found a cozy little small town bar scene there; we chatted up a local English teacher and got filled in on the honors curriculum at Riverhead High School, from Shakespeare to Elie Wiesel. (Jeanny and I first met as teachers in the 1990s, so we were actually quite interested.) I was a little worried we’d be tempted to eat from the pricey restaurant menu, so, along with a beer, I ordered what turned out to be the best deal on the menu, the $8 chowder loaded with smoked cod and apple wood bacon. Jeanny went rogue and ordered a shockingly insubstantial salad ($9 for “biodynamic” greens) and a bemusingly priced order of fries ($8). She would be paying for those herself. When Jeanny drove off the next morning, I set out to see just what was within walking distance of Greenport Village. (My plan was aided by some unseasonably balmy December weather.) Quite a bit, it turned out. A list of hiking trails the hotel gave me included paths in Inlet Pond County Park, just off Long Island Sound and about a one and half mile walk north. A Google Maps route sent me over back roads where traffic was limited to flitting robins, black-capped chickadees and the occasional cardinal. Its chosen route into the park, however, led through someone’s backyard and into what looked to be thick woods. After asking for directions, I looped around Sound Drive to just where the park met the water. But a gate and sign — “Private Beach” — stopped me. I was confused: How can a private beach be connected to a public park? But ever since a farmer in Arkansas scolded me for stepping onto his property to take an Instagram photo of some bales of hay, I’ve been averse to even seemingly harmless property rights violations. So I headed off-road, thrashing into the bramble that lay inside the park, catching my pants on thorns and wishing I had a machete. Advertisement Soon, though, I hit a trail, which looped around lovely Inlet Pond and, on several occasions, spurs that led right onto the beach. (So much for private.) Perhaps the walk would have been more traditionally lovely in the spring, but I quite liked the skeletal trees and windblown marsh grasses that gave it barren and blustery look. I came out at the trailhead Google Maps should have led me to in the first place, at a red house on Route 48 used by the North Fork Audubon Society. From there, it was an easy walk to Kontokosta Winery, just north of downtown Greenport on a bluff over the Sound. The long driveway through the vineyards themselves toward the tasting room — a rather regal-looking barn — makes for a dramatic approach. I’ll defer judgment on the wines to a more educated palate, but the servers were quite pleasant and the tasting (along with a walk out to the bluff) was certainly worth $10. It was not as good a deal, however, as the spot where I ended the trip after wandering through galleries and shops in town. North Fork tastings are not all about wine: at the Greenport Harbor Brewing Company, $8 gets you three ounces of each of seven beers — for a total of more than an English pint. I fell for the hoppy Other Side IPA, as well as for several of the very cute dogs hanging out in what turned out to be a canine-friendly, jam-packed local hangout. What it’s like in the summer, when it must fill with city folk, I have no idea — and, come to think of it, not much desire to find out.

Advertisement Advertisement By RAVI SOMAIYAJAN. 2, 2014 Ezra Klein, an analyst, columnist and television commentator who runs The Washington Post’s Wonkblog, is making plans to leave the newspaper after failing to win support for a new website he wanted to create within the company, according to four people with knowledge of the negotiations. Mr. Klein, who quickly ascended into the ranks of the Washington media establishment with a multiplatform blend of policy nuance and number-crunching on Wonkblog, approached Katharine Weymouth, the Post’s publisher, in recent weeks, the people said. After consultation with the newspaper’s editor, Marty Baron, according to one of the people, he put forward a proposal with detailed revenue projections to build a new website dedicated to explanatory journalism on a wide range of topics beyond political policy. It would have been affiliated with The Post, the person said, but would have been a separate enterprise. The investment he sought, the person said, was in eight figures. Ms. Weymouth and the paper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, declined to support the project. Since then, Mr. Klein has had discussions with several potential investors and venture capitalists in an effort to start the website himself, said those with knowledge of his plans, who insisted on anonymity in discussing them. Though the atmosphere within The Post was described as civilized, one person said, there has been some awkwardness. Still, it is possible that Mr. Klein could remain at The Post if talks about his plans were rekindled. As 2013 drew to a close, Neil Irwin, the economics editor of Wonkblog, joined The New York Times. Mr. Klein has been on vacation in San Francisco. Both declined to comment, as did The Washington Post. Advertisement The Washington Post owns the name Wonkblog, said a person with knowledge of the arrangement, and could continue it even without Mr. Klein. News of Mr. Klein’s proposal for a new website was first reported by The Huffington Post. Several other journalists who had seen their brands grow at big media organizations have left to expand on their own. Nate Silver, widely lauded for the data analysis that led to his accurate prediction of the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, left The Times in 2013 to build his own site, backed by ESPN. Walter S. Mossberg and Kara Swisher, who first came to prominence at The Wall Street Journal with their technology reporting and then built the AllThingsD technology news site and conference business, announced in the fall they were striking out on their own. They secured minority investment, renamed their site ReCode, and left Dow Jones officially this week. In an interview about that move earlier this week, Ms. Swisher said that they had decided against working in a large media company because “there is a lot of competition for resources, and there isn’t always the same willingness to take risks.” Mr. Klein is also a policy analyst for MSNBC, where he sometimes fills in for other hosts, and he writes for Bloomberg View. He is married to Annie Lowrey, a Times reporter. Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about the columnist Ezra Klein’s plans to leave The Washington Post, where he directs the popular Wonkblog, misspelled the given name of the newspaper’s publisher in some copies. She is Katharine Weymouth, not Katherine. A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2014, on page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Blogger Said to Plan to Leave The Post.

Foreign   Prime Minister Rules Out Third Term. Advertisement NEW DELHI — Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Friday that he would not be India’s next prime minister if the Congress Party-led United Progressive Alliance wins the national elections scheduled for this spring. “In a few months’ time, after the general election, I will hand the baton over to a new prime minister,” Mr. Singh said. “I hope it will be a U.P.A.-chosen prime minister, and our party will work to that end in the campaign for the general elections.” The prime minister also expressed his support for Rahul Gandhi, vice president of the Congress Party and scion of the powerful Gandhi family, as the party’s choice for the post of prime minister in the national elections. “Rahul Gandhi has outstanding credentials to be nominated, and I hope our party will take the decision at an appropriate time,” said Mr. Singh. At his first formal news conference since 2011, Mr. Singh defended a battered central government, which has faced serious allegations of corruption and inaction over the last decade, by calmly listing the achievements during his two terms, which now span nearly 10 years. He said the governing coalition has made efforts to combat corruption and initiate investigations after the government was accused of fraudulently allotting wireless phone licenses and coal fields to business groups. . “We have taken major steps to change the existing procedures for allocation of spectrum and coal by shifting to auctions so that these problems do not arise in future,” said Mr. Singh. “Where some decisions taken earlier, when allocations were made administratively, have come under question, they are being investigated,” he said. The scandals and a stagnant economy have taken a toll on the Congress Party’s fortunes at the polls. In recent state assembly elections, the party was routed in four states and managed to retain power only in the northeastern state of Mizoram. Congress’s main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., retained power in the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and wrested the state of Rajasthan from the Congress Party. The B.J.P. also finished with the most number of seats in the city-state of Delhi with 31, while the Congress Party was reduced from 43 seats to eight. Mr. Singh’s strongest words were reserved for Narendra Modi, chief minister of Gujarat and the B.J.P.’s prime ministerial candidate. After a journalist asked Mr. Singh whether his party was responsible for his image as a weak prime minister, Mr. Singh said he did not believe that he had been an ineffectual leader and that it was up to the historians to judge him. “If by strong prime minister you mean that you preside over the mass massacre of innocent citizens in the streets of Ahmedabad, that is a measure of strength I don’t think this country needs, least of all, in its prime minister,” said Mr. Singh, referring to the violent riots that occurred in Gujarat in 2002 while Mr. Modi was the state’s chief minister. Mr. Singh added that he sincerely believed it would be disastrous for the country to have Mr. Modi as its prime minister. Rajnath Singh, president of the B.J.P., called the prime minister’s remarks unfortunate. “Narendra Modi was a leader who transformed Gujarat into a model state through development and progress, and saying that the country will go into ruins if he becomes the prime minister is very laughable,” the B.J.P. president told reporters. What happened in 2002 was a tragedy, he said, but he noted that both the Supreme Court and the court’s special investigation team cleared Mr. Modi of any responsibility for the riots. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Are Sugary Drinks Fattening? Depends Who You Ask Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Are there good scientific studies that show that drinking sugar-sweetened soda increases the risk for obesity? The answer may vary depending on who is paying for the study. Researchers examined 17 large reviews of the subject (one review assessed results for adults and children separately, so there were 18 sets of study conclusions). Six of the studies reported receiving funds from industry groups, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, the American Beverage Association and others. The other 12 reviews claimed no conflicts of interest. The analysis appears in the December issue of PLOS Medicine. Among the reviews with no conflicts of interest, 10 of 12, or 83.3 percent, reported that sugary drinks were directly associated with weight gain or obesity. The conclusions of studies supported by industry were a mirror image: five of six — the same 83.3 percent — reported that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. “I wouldn’t say that industry participation alone is enough to dismiss the study’s results in the whole of nutrition research,” said the lead author, Maira Bes-Rastrollo, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Navarra in Spain. “But I think that the general public and the scientific community should be aware that the food industry has vested interests that may influence their conclusions.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/07/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Awareness: Assessing Sugary Drinks Fairly.

Sports   N.F.L. Wild-Card Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 3, 2014 Chiefs (11-5) at Colts (11-5)  4:35 p.m. Saturday Line: Colts by 2 The last time Kansas City won a playoff game, in January 1994, Joe Montana was the quarterback. He outdueled Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers with the help of Marcus Allen. Linebacker Derrick Thomas sacked Moon twice that day. If those names do not indicate how much time has passed, then perhaps this will drive home point: The No. 1 song that year was “The Sign” by Ace of Base. In the 20 years since, the Chiefs have never been truly relevant. But for the first nine games this season, the Chiefs were unbeatable. Quarterback Alex Smith was providing the stable, efficient skills that he honed in his last two seasons in San Francisco, Jamaal Charles was among the N.F.L.’s best running backs, and the defense was punishing opposing quarterbacks with a fearsome front seven. Then Kansas City largely fell apart, going 2-5 the rest of the way. Even the expected return of Justin Houston, the team’s best pass rusher, is offset by the potential for Tamba Hali, his partner in sacks, to miss the game with a knee injury. Indianapolis would be particularly vulnerable to the Chiefs at full strength, as pass protection has been an issue in Andrew Luck’s first two seasons. But in Week 16, the short-handed Chiefs sacked him only once and they lost, 23-7. The red-hot Colts will do everything they can to recreate that result. Advertisement Pick: Colts Saints (11-5) at Eagles (10-6) 8:10 p.m. Saturday Line: Eagles by 3 The funny thing about having an extreme home-field advantage is how little it means when a road game comes along. For New Orleans, which thrives in its raucous indoor atmosphere, playing away from home was an issue even before the Superdome was built. As a franchise, the Saints are 0-5 in road playoff games. The current team was no better than its predecessors during the regular season, going 3-5 on the road with the Drew Brees-led offense averaging 17.8 points a game. At home, the Saints were 8-0, scoring an average of 34 points a game. New Orleans needs its offense to figure out a way to win not only outside, but also in extreme cold. The forecast for Philadelphia called for temperatures in the low 20s. The Eagles offense is so dynamic that Nick Foles came off the bench to lead the league in quarterback rating and managed to overshadow LeSean McCoy, who led everyone in rushing yards by a wide margin. McCoy had 1,607 yards on the ground, and his closest competition was Chicago’s Matt Forte at 1,339. Keeping the game interesting will be Philadelphia’s subpar secondary, which allowed an N.F.L.-worst 289.8 passing yards a game and will give Brees at least a small chance of overcoming his team’s road woes. Pick: Eagles Chargers (9-7) at Bengals (11-5) 1:05 p.m. Sunday Line: Bengals by 7 Five players who appeared on the Cincinnati roster this season were not born the last time the Bengals won a playoff game, including Giovani Bernard, the dynamic rookie running back. But they are heavy favorites against San Diego, which defied the odds by qualifying for the playoffs on the season’s final day. The Chargers had help from the Bengals, whose win over the Ravens eliminated the competition. Philip Rivers was on fire at the end of the season, spurring San Diego by passing for 845 passing yards and nine touchdowns over the last four games. But winning on a cold Sunday afternoon in Cincinnati will be a tall order. The Bengals were tough at home this season, going 8-0 and shutting down Ben Roethlisberger, Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck and Joe Flacco. Cincinnati was also more of a force on offense, with Andy Dalton seeming to come into his own in his third season and throwing for a career-high 33 touchdowns. Despite his propensity for turnovers — his 20 interceptions were the most among playoff quarterbacks — he did enough to help out the Bengals’ stellar defense. Advertisement For the Chargers to win on the road, Rivers will need to continue his hot streak and their secondary, which struggled for most of the season, will have to play an uncharacteristically perfect game. Pick: Bengals 49ers (12-4) at Packers (8-7-1)  4:40 p.m. Sunday Line: 49ers by 3 These teams matched up in perhaps the most anticipated playoff game last season. This time the expectations are somewhat tempered because Green Bay barely managed a winning record and San Francisco’s offense looks much less explosive. All eyes will be on 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who ran for a playoff-record 181 yards against the Packers, then flipped the script, passing for 412 yards in this season’s Week 1 victory. The only thing left for him to do is to beat the Packers as a receiver. The season opener, however, was one of the few moments when Kaepernick provided the same level of excitement and production that he did in his breakout run to Super Bowl XLVII. He was still a force on offense with his arm and his legs, but Kaepernick occasionally struggled with accuracy and decision-making, leading to long scoring droughts. San Francisco, the preseason favorite in the N.F.C., looked like a second-class citizen compared with division rival Seattle. Kaepernick has been hot in the 49ers’ current six-game winning streak, and he should have plenty of motivation in facing his favorite opponent — and favorite team growing up. The conditions will be harsh, but San Francisco, with Frank Gore and Kaepernick, has the ability to grind out a game on the ground. If Eddie Lacy is not at full speed, the pass-happy Packers may find themselves grounded at home. Pick: 49ers Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.

Business   George Goodman, Who Demystified the World of Money, Dies at 83. Advertisement Advertisement By DOUGLAS MARTINJAN. 3, 2014 George J. W. Goodman, who demystified financial complexities in best-selling books and on a long-running public television program under the name of one of history’s most famous economists, Adam Smith, died on Friday in Miami. He was 83. The cause was complications of leukemia, his son, Mark, said. Mr. Goodman helped start Institutional Investor magazine in the 1960s. He was executive editor of Esquire in the 1970s. He wrote novels, nonfiction books and a popular children’s book. But he was probably best known as the amiable but intellectually rigorous host of “Adam Smith’s Money World,” seen on PBS from 1984 to 1997. Mr. Goodman did not choose the pseudonym Adam Smith, after the 18th-century philosopher who shaped the discipline of economics with his concept of an “invisible hand” that governed markets. Rather, it was given to him as a young journalist for New York magazine in the 1960s, to hide his identity from sensitive Wall Street sources. He hated the name at first and tried to change it, but he could not find out who had bestowed it, although many sources said it was Clay Felker, New York magazine’s founding editor. “Of course, after my books became successful, three people owned up,” Mr. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times in 1981. Advertisement His first book as Adam Smith, “The Money Game,” published in the spring of 1968, became an immediate best seller and remained one for the rest of the year. In it, he posited that the machinations of money were high drama, understandable to the lay reader and, perhaps most important to the book’s success, humorous. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post both lauded it as a masterly exposition of mass psychology. Mr. Goodman followed up with more books about economics, including “Supermoney” (1972) and “Paper Money” (1981). In “Paper Money,” he made a joke about economists’ jargon that became famous in and out of the field: Stuck without tools on a desert island, an economist theorizes, “Assume a can opener.” In 1985, as “Adam Smith’s Money World” was beginning its run, Mr. Goodman told United Press International that the show was about money, not economics. “Everybody’s interested in money,” he said. “Money, food and sex, not necessarily in that order.” He continued, “As my Texas friends say, ‘Money ain’t everything, but everything won’t go out with you unless you’ve got it.’ ” George Jerome Waldo Goodman was born in Clayton, Mo., on Aug. 10, 1930. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, then studied political economy at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. He served in the Army as an intelligence analyst in the mid-1950s, then wrote about various topics for Barron’s, Time, Fortune and other magazines. His passion in the 1950s was writing novels. His first was “The Bubble Makers” (1955), a story of conflict between a Harvard student and his wealthy grandfather. He had written it instead of a thesis at Oxford. Three subsequent novels were well received, with critics particularly complimentary about their dialogue. Mr. Goodman’s fourth novel, “The Wheeler Dealers” (1959), about the pyrotechnics between a Texas oil baron and a female broker, was made into a movie in 1963 starring James Garner and Lee Remick. Mr. Goodman wrote the screenplay. But he soon began focusing on economic matters, an interest he had demonstrated with his satirical treatment of upper-class characters in his novels. “I was curious to know why some people make money and others don’t,” he told Lear’s magazine in 1989. Advertisement He began managing what he told U.P.I. was “a small, aggressive mutual fund,” started a regular financial feature in New York magazine and helped found The Institutional Investor. As his economics books succeeded, he turned to television, where he employed graphics, interviews and even cartoons to clarify financial issues. “Adam Smith’s Money World” was broadcast in 40 countries. But the best part of “Adam Smith’s Money World,” John Corry wrote in The Times in 1984, was Mr. Goodman’s commentary. Mr. Goodman, he suggested, should spend more time “interviewing himself.” Mr. Goodman’s wife, the former Sallie Brophy, died in 2007. In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughter, Susannah Goodman; his partner, Lynda Richards; and three grandchildren. Mr. Goodman said his most widely read work may have been “Bascombe, the Fastest Hound Alive,” a children’s book he published in 1958. But it was his ability to evoke an emotional response to economic phenomenon that most defined his impact. “We are at a wonderful ball where the champagne sparkles in every glass and soft laughter falls upon the summer air,” he wrote of a high-flying stock market in “The Money Game.” “We know at some moment the black horsemen will come shattering through the terrace doors wreaking vengeance and scattering the survivors,” he continued. “Those who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking — what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.” A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2014, on page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: George Goodman, Who Demystified the World of Money, Dies at 83.

Foreign   Deadly Violence Erupts During Rallies Across Egypt. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREEM FAHIMJAN. 3, 2014 CAIRO — At least 13 people were killed as violence broke out during Muslim Brotherhood marches in several Egyptian cities on Friday, health officials said, in the deadliest day of clashes in months. The victims included protesters — one an 18-year-old college sophomore — and, apparently, bystanders. Brotherhood supporters said riot police officers had fired on their marches without provocation in some places, while the authorities said they had seized weapons from demonstrators. Dozens of people sustained gunshot and other injuries in violence that was the latest blow to the military-backed government, which is trying to impose stability just 10 days before Egyptians are set to vote on a draft constitution. Six months after the army’s ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, a Brotherhood leader, the grinding civil conflict between Mr. Morsi’s supporters and the government appears to be reaching another peak. The authorities are desperate to hold the constitutional referendum, seeing it as a chance to quiet unrest by marginalizing the Brotherhood with a public show of support for the government-sponsored charter. A strong showing, the official thinking goes, would bolster the government’s legitimacy, and restore momentum to a transitional plan that is supposed to lead to parliamentary and presidential elections. Before the vote, the authorities have stepped up a crackdown on opponents, arresting hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and non-Islamist activists. Advertisement The Brotherhood has responded to the government’s efforts to eradicate the movement — including, last month, officially designating it a terrorist group — by trying to project endurance and vowing to continue the protests. Brotherhood supporters have intensified their demonstrations on campuses, including Al-Azhar University in Cairo. On the past two Fridays, the traditional day of protest, Brotherhood leaders have mustered sizable crowds around the country. Fighting was reported on Friday in several cities, including Cairo, Alexandria and Ismailia. In Fayoum, a senior Brotherhood leader said, the authorities fired live ammunition at marches that had set off from three mosques after prayers, killing the student, Mahmoud Abdel-Aziz, and two men ages 31 and 52. In Cairo, one man was shot dead after yelling insults at Brotherhood protesters, a security official told the Reuters news agency. In Alexandria, an Associated Press cameraman reported seeing dozens of protesters armed with homemade pistols clashing with security forces. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that 17 of its officers had been injured with birdshot, and that 235 Brotherhood members had been arrested. Asmaa al Zohairy contributed reporting.

Business   50 Years Later, War on Poverty Is a Mixed Bag. Advertisement Advertisement By ANNIE LOWREYJAN. 4, 2014 WASHINGTON — To many Americans, the war on poverty declared 50 years ago by President Lyndon B. Johnson has largely failed. The poverty rate has fallen only to 15 percent from 19 percent in two generations, and 46 million Americans live in households where the government considers their income scarcely adequate. But looked at a different way, the federal government has succeeded in preventing the poverty rate from climbing far higher. There is broad consensus that the social welfare programs created since the New Deal have hugely improved living conditions for low-income Americans. At the same time, in recent decades, most of the gains from the private economy have gone to those at the top of the income ladder. Half a century after Mr. Johnson’s now-famed State of the Union address, the debate over the government’s role in creating opportunity and ending deprivation has flared anew, with inequality as acute as it was in the Roaring Twenties and the ranks of the poor and near-poor at record highs. Programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps are keeping millions of families afloat. Republicans have sought to cut both programs, an illustration of the intense disagreement between the two political parties over the best solutions for bringing down the poverty rate as quickly as possible, or eliminating it. For poverty to decrease, “the low-wage labor market needs to improve,” James P. Ziliak of the University of Kentucky said. “We need strong economic growth with gains widely distributed. If the private labor market won’t step up to the plate, we’re going to have to strengthen programs to help these people get by and survive.” Advertisement In Washington, President Obama has called inequality the “defining challenge of our time.” To that end, he intends to urge states to expand their Medicaid programs to poor, childless adults, and is pushing for an increase in the minimum wage and funding for early-childhood programs. But conservatives, like Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have looked at the poverty statistics more skeptically, contending that the government has misspent its safety-net money and needs to focus less on support and more on economic and job opportunities. “The nation should face up to two facts: poverty rates are too high, especially among children, and spending money on government means-tested programs is at best a partial solution,” Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution wrote in an assessment of the shortfalls on the war on poverty. Washington already spends enough on antipoverty programs to lift all Americans out of poverty, he said. “To mount an effective war against poverty,” he added, “we need changes in the personal decisions of more young Americans.” Advertisement Still, a broad range of researchers interviewed by The New York Times stressed the improvement in the lives of low-income Americans since Mr. Johnson started his crusade. Infant mortality has dropped, college completion rates have soared, millions of women have entered the work force, malnutrition has all but disappeared. After all, when Mr. Johnson announced his campaign, parts of Appalachia lacked electricity and indoor plumbing. Many economists argue that the official poverty rate grossly understates the impact of government programs. The headline poverty rate counts only cash income, not the value of in-kind benefits like food stamps. A fuller accounting suggests the poverty rate has dropped to 16 percent today, from 26 percent in the late 1960s, economists say. But high rates of poverty — measured by both the official government yardstick and the alternatives that many economists prefer — have remained a remarkably persistent feature of American society. About four in 10 black children live in poverty; for Hispanic children, that figure is about three in 10. According to one recent study, as of mid-2011, in any given month, 1.7 million households were living on cash income of less than $2 a person a day, with the prevalence of the kind of deep poverty commonly associated with developing nations increasing since the mid-1990s. Both economic and sociological trends help explain why so many children and adults remain poor, even putting the effects of the recession aside. More parents are raising a child alone, with more infants born out of wedlock. High incarceration rates, especially among black men, keep many families apart. About 30 percent of single mothers live in poverty. In some cases, government programs have helped fewer families because of program changes and budget cuts, researchers said. For instance, the 1996 Clinton-era welfare overhaul drastically cut the cash assistance available to needy families, often ones headed by single mothers. Advertisement “As of 1996, we expected single mothers to go to work,” Professor Ziliak said. “But if they’re shelling out most of their weekly pay in the form of child care, they can’t make sense of doing it.” The more important driver of the still-high poverty rate, researchers said, is the poor state of the labor market for low-wage workers and spiraling inequality. Over the last 30 years, growth has generally failed to translate into income gains for workers — even as the American labor force has become better educated and more skilled. About 40 percent of low-wage workers have attended or completed college, and 80 percent have completed high school. Economists remain sharply divided on the reasons, with technological change, globalization, the decline of labor unions and the falling value of the minimum wage often cited as major factors. But with real incomes for a vast number of middle-class and low-wage workers in decline, safety-net programs have become more instrumental in keeping families’ heads above water. The earned-income tax credit, for instance, has increased employment among single mothers and kept six million Americans above the poverty line in 2011. Food stamps, formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, kept four million Americans out of poverty in 2011. Above all, the government has proved most successful in aiding the elderly through the New Deal-era Social Security program and the creation of Medicare in the 1960s. The poverty rate among older Americans fell to just 9 percent in 2012 from 35 percent in 1959. But for working-age households, both conservatives and liberals agree that government transfer programs alone cannot eliminate poverty. The answer, the White House has said, is in trying to improve households’ earnings before tax and transfer programs take effect. “Going forward, the biggest potential gains that could be made on poverty would be in raising market incomes,” said Jason Furman, the chairman of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “In the short run, that means things like the minimum wage, and in the long run, things like early education.” If Congress approved a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour from its current level of $7.25, it would reduce the poverty rate of working-age Americans by 1.7 percentage points, lifting about five million people out of poverty, according to research by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. But in the meantime, the greatest hope for poorer Americans would be a stronger economic recovery that brought the unemployment rate down from its current level of 7 percent and drew more people into the work force. The poverty rate for full-time workers is just 3 percent. For those not working, it is 33 percent.

Foreign   Strategic Corridor in West Bank Remains a Stumbling Block in Mideast Talks. Advertisement Advertisement By ISABEL KERSHNERJAN. 4, 2014 BARDALA, West Bank — The residents of this neglected Palestinian farming village in the northern Jordan Valley area of the West Bank say they get running water once every three days, which they store in bottles and cisterns. The neighboring Jewish settlement of Mehola is a small paradise by comparison, with green lawns and a swimming pool. The contrasts across this stark landscape of jagged hills reflect the complexities of the fierce contest for control of the Jordan Valley, and the challenges the Palestinians face in administration. As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators struggle to make headway on peace talks initiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, they have remained bitterly at odds over the strategic corridor that runs between the populous heartland of the West Bank and the border with Jordan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel insists on maintaining a long-term Israeli military presence along the border to prevent infiltrations and weapons smuggling from the east. Some in his Likud Party say there is no security or strategic depth without the settlements and argue that Israel should annex the area permanently. The Palestinians insist that Israel withdraw its forces and settlements so they can control their own borders as part of an independent and sovereign state. But for the residents of the Jordan Valley, where the long summers are intense and the black flies ubiquitous, the diplomatic jockeying is secondary to the hard realities facing two intertwined, adversarial communities. While settlers worry they will lose their homes, the Palestinians, who view the fertile valley as the breadbasket of a future state, are concerned that Israel will continue to control nearly all the water and land. Advertisement “We live at their mercy,” said Dirar Sawafta, an employee of the Bardala village council. Some 60,000 Palestinians live here in scattered villages and the ancient oasis city of Jericho. They farm about 8,600 acres of the land, much of it leased from wealthy Palestinian landowners in Jerusalem and Nablus. Many complain of mismanagement and dysfunction on the part of the Palestinian Authority, which administers Jericho and the villages, as well as the strictures of Israeli military rule. The 6,500 Israeli settlers live in 21 small communities interspersed with army bases. Farming nearly 13,000 acres, they use treated wastewater to irrigate their abundant date groves and employ 6,000 Palestinians in a thriving agricultural enterprise adapted to the semitropical climate. Advertisement Palestinian leaders contend that Israel wants to remain here indefinitely out of economic interests. Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator, who lives in Jericho and represents the Jordan Valley in the Palestinian legislature, listed the settlers’ assets: “The biggest palm farms, the biggest grape farms, turkey farms and alligator lakes.” Yet the Jordan Valley settlers — many of whom came in search of a pastoral life under the aegis of security-minded Labor-led governments after the 1967 war — live with growing uncertainty that the government will support their continued presence there. In 1997, during his first term as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu wrote a letter to the settlers saying that “the Jordan Valley will be an integral part of the state of Israel under any agreement.” But many settlers here note that Mr. Netanyahu now speaks only of maintaining a military presence. In Bardala, the issues are complex, as occupation and internal Palestinian problems have left the wells dry. Before Israel conquered the area from Jordan in 1967, Bardala’s water came from a nearby spring. But the Israelis dug a deeper well nearby. “Ours dried up,” Mr. Sawafta said. A deal was made in the 1970s, and the Oslo peace accords of the 1990s brought new water agreements, but with the second uprising in 2000, Palestinians stopped paying their water and electricity bills to the Palestinian Authority. The Bardala council owes the authority about two million shekels (more than $560,000) in unpaid utility bills. So, Mr. Sawafta said, the authority has delayed funding for projects like new roads, a dam and a water network in the village. Israel deducts the utility debts from the tax revenue it collects on behalf of the authority. Then the ever-cash-poor Palestinian government uses the rest to pay its employees’ salaries. Advertisement After that, there is little left to aid the farmers. Rifaat Hamdallah Daraghmeh, a Palestinian who employs 15 families on a farm he runs in the Jiftlik area of the valley and sells produce in Israel, said the authority owed him 300,000 shekels (about $85,000) in unpaid tax refunds over the past four years. Abdul Ghaffar Dawabshe, the deputy director of the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture department in Jericho, said there were 60 such cases in his office. Khirbet Makhoul, a Bedouin-style encampment in the northern Jordan Valley, has in recent months become a symbol of the continuing struggle over every inch of Jordan Valley land. In September, Israeli army bulldozers arrived at dawn and razed all the temporary structures, including those that housed animals and people. Supporters brought new tents, but the army came back three more times. The women and children moved to permanent homes in Tamoun, a village near Nablus. “We used to live like kings,” said Ashraf Bisharat, 30, a member of one of the dozen or so families raising livestock here, who noted that before September, the bare hillside was filled with animal shelters. Makhoul sits between three army bases, and soldiers in training provide a steady background noise of booms and gunfire. Israeli defense officials said the shelters had been destroyed because they were erected without permits. The families have refused to leave the land they say they have owned or leased for decades. Now the authority is helping them register their plots and obtain permits. One animal shelter was rebuilt. Some of the local men were sleeping under nylon sheets, each on the ruins of his family tent. Most of the Jordan Valley is classified as Area C, the part of the West Bank that remains under full Israeli control. Permits, whether for agricultural packing houses or zinc-roofed shacks, are hard to come by, and demolitions take place almost daily. For now, the Jewish settlers are guarding their positions, too. After two Palestinians from the Hebron area bludgeoned a retired Israeli colonel to death in October in the yard of his home in Brosh Habika, an isolated tourism village here, yeshiva students and families from a nearby religious settlement temporarily moved into the holiday chalets to reinforce and demonstrate a presence. In recent years, the settlers have planted part of a demilitarized zone between the border security fence and the actual border along the Jordan River with thousands of date palms. Children of the founders of the settlements who left for the city are now returning, attracted by cheap housing and rural community living. This week, a senior Likud minister dedicated a new neighborhood in Gitit, a remote, once-secular settlement that has been revived by an influx of religious settlers. Advertisement “It took us 30 years to understand what to grow and how to grow it,” David Alhayani, the Likud head of the settlers’ Jordan Valley Regional Council, said in a recent interview. Mr. Alhayani runs an herb farm in his hilltop settlement, Argaman, where he employs more than 20 Palestinians. He spoke of quiet friendship and cooperation with his workers and some local Palestinian notables. “They called us pioneers, salt of the earth, the true Zionists,” he said of the Israeli mainstream. Now, he said, the Labor Party and many others seem to have abandoned the Jordan Valley settlers. “We came because our government sent us here — all the governments of Israel,” he added. “If the Israeli government decides differently, we will accept the decision.” Said Ghazali contributed reporting.

Society   A Romance Goes From Head to Heart. Advertisement Advertisement By MARGAUX LASKEYJAN. 5, 2014 Barbara Catherine Galletly and Grant Olney Passmore were married Saturday by the Rev. Davis Bailey, a Presbyterian minister, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia. In August, the bride, 30, received a master’s in information studies from the University of Texas. Until 2011, she was a literary agent at Georges Borchardt in New York. She graduated from Brown. She is a daughter of Catherine G. Galletly and Donald R. Galletly of Wayne, Pa. The bride’s father is a senior vice president at Devine & Partners, a public relations firm in Philadelphia. Her mother, now retired, worked in Houston as a senior vice president for financial institutions at Bank of America. The groom, also 30, is a mathematical researcher at the University of Edinburgh, and a singer and songwriter. He graduated from University of Texas and received a certificate in mathematical logic from the Mathematical Research Institute in the Netherlands. He holds a Ph.D. in automated theorem-proving and high-dimensional geometry from the University of Edinburgh. He is the son of Donna O. Passmore and Dr. John M. Passmore of Sugar Land, Tex. The groom’s mother is a founder of Values Through History, an educational nonprofit there that creates American history curriculums for schools. His father is a cardiologist at Methodist Diagnostic Cardiology of Houston. Advertisement Mr. Passmore had heard about Ms. Galletly long before they came in direct contact, primarily through Ms. Galletly’s sister, Patrice, a co-worker of his own sister. In January 2012, he happened to click on a link found on Patrice Galletly’s Facebook page that led to an essay written by Barbara Galletly, who within a short period had moved from New York to Los Angeles to Austin. It was titled “Doing This Again.” Mr. Passmore could relate. “It was a beautiful piece,” he said. “I was a Ph.D. student, and I moved around like crazy. She was having a similar nomadic 20s.” When he sent her an email, Ms. Galletly was delightfully stunned. She, in turn, responded, “Oh, my goodness, I’ll never have a fan again.” And so began a seven-month trans-Atlantic correspondence about their passions and pursuits. They discussed early Internet culture and digital preservation. He tutored her in calculus and statistics (skills she needed for graduate school), and she taught him about literary theory. They shared a Dropbox folder through which they shared music, pictures and articles. “I remember having to work up the courage to call it Our Folder,” Mr. Passmore said. “It was a real intellectual romance.” At one point, she copied and pasted their correspondence into a Word document. It was 300 pages long. Yet they still hadn’t talked on the phone. They finally met in the summer of 2012, when she was working as an intern in the library and archive at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, and Mr. Passmore was on a project at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. While there was an almost immediate connection and a sense of comfort with each other, when she picked him up at the airport, they were both nervous, Ms. Galletly particularly so. “I didn’t want it to be ruined,” she said. She came around, and two days later they shared their first kiss. Advertisement “It was like, ‘Oh my gosh, what could be better?’ ” she said. “I feel like I won the lottery.” MARGAUX LASKEY A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2014, on page ST11 of the New York edition with the headline: A Romance Goes From Head to Heart.

Sports   After Long Wait, Good Things Come to Visiting Saints. Advertisement Advertisement By BILL PENNINGTONJAN. 5, 2014 PHILADELPHIA — The New Orleans Saints joined the N.F.L. in 1967 and did not make the playoffs for 20 years. It took the Saints another 13 years to win a playoff game. And Saturday night, 46 seasons after their debut in the N.F.L., they finally won a road playoff game. The Saints’ 26-24 win Saturday in an N.F.C. wild-card game in Philadelphia, sealed with a 32-yard field goal by Shayne Graham on the game’s final play, was more than a franchise playoff milestone. To the players, it helped them begin to move away from a 2012 season marred by a bounty scandal. “It’s a new team and a new year,” said New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, who has been with the Saints through the bad and the good, including the team’s Super Bowl victory after the 2009 season. “We’re not living off the glory or the mistakes of the past. We’re making a new history and hopefully we’re only going to get better.” Saints Coach Sean Payton, who was suspended last year by the N.F.L., was also eager to look forward. “This team has the resolve to overcome many distractions,” Payton said. “With all the other stuff that’s gone on, including last year, we’ve now got 12 wins. And we won on the road. I thought we traveled pretty well tonight.” An uneven game that began sleepily suddenly turned electrifying and tense in the fourth quarter as Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles and Brees dueled throughout a seesaw final quarter. The outcome left the Saints (12-5) on their way to face the Seattle Seahawks next weekend. The Eagles’ season ended but not after a surprisingly successful year that saw them win 10 games and go to first place in the N.F.C. East from last. Advertisement “We’re all proud of how far we went,” Philadelphia wide receiver Riley Cooper said. “But everybody wants to win more — win everything. All I can say is that we’re headed in the right direction.” With the Saints leading by 23-17 midway through the fourth quarter, Foles led the Eagles on a 77-yard scoring drive. The key sequence was a pass interference penalty on Saints cornerback Corey White that netted Philadelphia 40 yards and gave them a first down at the New Orleans 3-yard line. Two plays later, Foles threw to Zach Ertz for the go-ahead touchdown and a 24-23 Eagles lead with less than five minutes to play. But the Saints’ Darren Sproles returned the ensuing kickoff 39 yards and there was a 15-yard penalty for a horse-collar tackle tacked onto the end of the return. Two plays later, the Saints had advanced to the Eagles 35-yard line. The Saints methodically worked the football closer to the end zone, trying to use up as much clock as possible. With three seconds remaining in the game, the Saints took their final time out setting up the winning kick, Graham’s fourth field goal of the game. Graham was another new face of the New Orleans turnaround. Three weeks ago, he was not on the roster. That was when Graham was brought in to replace the slumping place kicker Garrett Hartley. “He’s been unbelievable,” Payton said. “Each one of those kicks tonight was down the middle. He was a rock out there.” With the final score of the game, the teams had combined for 16 points in the fourth quarter and 37 in the second half. Trailing by 7-6 at the start of the second half, the Saints seemed intent on establishing the run game and it was a successful strategy. As much as Brees played well in the second half, and completed 20 of 30 passes for 250 yards over all, the Saints running backs rushed for 185 yards and averaged more than 5 yards per carry. Advertisement Mark Ingram, playing for the injured starting running back Pierre Thomas, ran for 97 yards on 18 attempts and had pivotal runs in the Saints’ first scoring drive of the second half. That series culminated with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Brees to Lance Moore. It was a typically intricate Saints play. With multiple receivers working the sidelines, Brees waited in the pocket as Moore, releasing late and working underneath the other receivers, sprung free in the middle of the field for the touchdown. That score put New Orleans ahead and Brees helped extend the lead with some effective deep downfield passing that led to a 4-yard touchdown run by Ingram that gave New Orleans a 20-7 advantage in the third quarter. But the Eagles decided that they could run the football, too, and behind LeSean McCoy mounted an eight-play touchdown drive that cut the New Orleans lead to 20-14. When Saints starting cornerback Keenan Lewis was sidelined with a head injury, his absence seemed to unleash the Eagles talented wide receiver DeSean Jackson. He caught two passes and also had a 29-yard punt return that set up a 31-yard field goal by Alex Henery that cut the Saints’ lead to 20-17 early in the fourth quarter. But Brees managed to rally the Saints again, connecting with wide receiver Robert Meacham for 40 yards down the middle of the field — a reception that led to a 35-yard field goal by Graham and a 23-17 New Orleans lead. Though much was made of the Saints having to play in the winter elements of the Northeastern corridor as opposed to the domed stadium in New Orleans where they were undefeated this season, the game was played in relatively benign conditions. The game time temperature was 25 degrees with only a 5-mile-an-hour wind. So bad weather was not an excuse for the sloppy play by both teams in the early going. Brees threw two first-half interceptions and Foles, the league’s top-rated passer, had just 98 passing yards in the first two quarters. Foles would finish the game with only 195 passing yards as he completed 23 of 33 passes. While the Eagles held a 1-point lead at halftime, it was the Saints who were buoyed in the locker room at intermission. “We knew we would be all right if we stopped shooting ourselves in the foot,” Payton said. In the Saints locker room afterward, most of the conversation was about finally getting a road playoff victory after five losses away from home in the postseason. New Orleans tackle Zach Strief was asked if he thought questions about the Saints’ road playoff woes would now cease. “Probably not,” Strief said. “Now we go to Seattle, where it’s tough to play. It will come up all week again.” A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2014, on page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: After Long Wait, Good Things Come to Visiting Saints.

Travel   Traveling While Black. Advertisement Advertisement By FARAI CHIDEYAJAN. 3, 2014 As I walked through the Forbidden City, the majestic imperial palace at the center of Beijing, with a friend and her teenager, I scanned the crowd. In the maze of shrines and courtyards, there was no one quite like us: I am an African-American with long dreadlocks, and my friend, Maria, a Mexican-American, had her half-Dominican son in tow. And yet, we were nearly invisible — at least to the guards checking the bags of Chinese tourists, possibly for materials that could be used in protests at this landmark, which adjoins Tiananmen Square. We passed through checkpoint after checkpoint unhindered, while Chinese people were stopped and their bags searched. Sure, we got a couple of stares from people. But no one touched our hair, pointed or acted hostile — which has happened to me as a tourist even in the United States. Once again, my travels had taken me to a place — not just a physical but a mental place — where the rules as I knew them had changed. That is partly what drives my wanderlust. And I am part of a sizable fellowship of African-Americans on a mission to see the world. Seventeen percent of African-Americans take one or more international trips a year, and we spend $48 billion on travel in the United States alone, according to the Mandala Research firm. That amount may be smaller than spending by other (not mutually exclusive) niche groups like LGBT travelers ($70 billion). But, according to analysts at MMGY Global, a marketing firm, black travel has rebounded since 2008, which is notable considering that the great recession doubled the gap between black and white wealth. When you look at per capita income, our travel spending is significant. Yet for all of that buying power, major hospitality companies and tour operators often steer clear of targeting African-Americans. After all, it’s complicated. Hoteliers are promoting women-only floors, but that idea would be anathema to black travelers, who are concerned about getting equal and respectful treatment from staff members. Similarly, tour operators pushing gay-friendly getaways would not be wise to advertise trips as “black-friendly.” We are a niche that it seems shouldn’t exist in a country that aspires to be postracial. As a result, minority travelers are mainly paving our own path, guided by ourselves, our social and professional networks and by bloggers. We are a largely untapped market, exploring the world without being aggressively sold an itinerary on how to do it. That means there are few guidebooks or tour operators to prepare me for the moment of surprise that I experienced in the Forbidden City. And it is one of the reasons that travel right now feels more freeing than ever. Advertisement For African-Americans, domestic and international exploration used to be filled with significant roadblocks. From the late 19th century until the civil rights era, the lack of parity in pay left African-Americans with little to spend on leisure (a disparity that continues to this day); segregation meant substandard seats and service on public transportation; and finding lodging on the road if you were black, in particular, was a challenge, especially in the South. “The Negro Traveler’s Green Book” was published from 1936 until 1964 to give black travelers a list of places where it was safe to stay and to stop. Published by a postal worker named Victor H. Green, the book was used by thousands of African-Americans as they crisscrossed the United States by car. Green optimistically wrote in one edition: “There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States.” As part of the generation that came after Green’s last edition, I was raised to believe that the world was mine by my Zimbabwean father and my African-American mother, a Baltimore native who headed off to Morocco to serve in the Peace Corps. When I was 5, I traveled with my mother and younger sister to visit my father’s family in what was then apartheid-like Rhodesia. I remember meeting my grandparents and scores of cousins, many of whom did not speak English, and sitting with the family at sunset, eating chewy maize roasted over the fire. It was the first time I felt a specific comforting heart-song, repeated over the years in places like the outdoor terrace cafe of the Louvre in Paris to the top of Mount Tamalpais in Northern California. That feeling can take on particular meaning because it disrupts double-consciousness — the term coined by W. E. B. DuBois to explain the necessity of African-Americans to constantly regard themselves through others’ eyes. As a black traveler, I seek liberation through exploration and find myself seeming freer, at least in mind and heart, on the road than at home. Many others feel that way, too. Elaine Lee is one such kindred spirit. She runs the site Ugogurl.com, which features a picture of Ms. Lee hefting an ice ax at the top of a New Zealand glacier. A lawyer by trade, she’s also the editor of the anthology “Go Girl: The Black Woman’s Book of Travel and Adventure.” “Travel is the music of my soul,” Ms. Lee said. “The biggest surprise about traveling internationally was to discover that in many parts of the world, it is an asset to be a black woman, unlike in North America, where it is often a liability. Travel to Africa is among the most healing of all. You go there and get part of your soul back.” The idea that travel is a soul-stirring experience was echoed by Greg Gross, who got a taste for traveling when, as a child, he went from New Orleans to Los Angeles on the Sunset Limited. A former newspaper journalist, Mr. Gross started the blog ImBlackNITravel.com (I’m Black and I Travel) six years ago after coming across a black woman in Natchez, Miss., who proudly said she never intended to set foot outside the limits of her native city. Though he’s traveled the world, he says his most emotionally resonant moment happened in the United States, in the nation’s capital: “I walked over to the Lincoln Memorial. I wanted to stand on the exact step where Martin Luther King Jr. had stood to give his famed ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, to see the view that he saw that day. And I found it. To be in that place, to look out over that same vista, was a moment more powerful than I can explain.  I couldn’t talk. I could barely breathe. I was not the same when I came down off those steps.” There are other, more practical benefits particular to black travelers, like the ability to blend in. Brian Keith Jackson, a novelist who sometimes contributes text and film to the work of the artist Kehinde Wiley, has lived in Beijing, far from his northern Louisiana roots. “In many places, because most of the Western world has been white and has projected their images as white, black skin means Africa, not America,” he said. “Although I’m an American, people don’t view me as an American.” Mr. Jackson, who has short-cropped hair, believes that his pecan skin tone, and the perceptions around it, “helped me in my travels, because everyone thinks I’m from there, certainly in Sri Lanka.” Brown skin that’s often perceived as “otherness” in parts of America is not seen that way in much of the world. After traveling to more than 25 countries (and 48 of the states), I call being brown in a region of brown-skinned people “masking.” I experienced it in southern India, where many people were similar shades of brown as me or darker. I was not mistaken for being a local, but I could circulate less conspicuously than fair-skinned visitors. I took advantage of my skin color (and some common-sense cultural and street smarts, like dressing modestly, showing no valuables and staying alert) to go solo and explore low-income areas of Mumbai that the guards at my luxury hotel had warned me against visiting. My reward: I was invited to lunch at the home of a family, where an older couple and their son and daughter-in-law shared a two-room house. Advertisement That isn’t to say that the experience of traveling while black is one high note after the other. There are bias attacks on blacks in the United States and abroad. Last year, for example, the United States State Department issued an advisory, still in effect, about Greece warning that “there has been a rise in unprovoked harassment and violent attacks against persons who, because of their complexion, are perceived to be foreign migrants. U.S. citizens most at risk are those of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern descent.” And there are high-profile but low-danger incidents, as when Oprah Winfrey was denied a look at a $38,000 purse in Switzerland — “too expensive,” the billionaire said a sales assistant told her. (Of course, not many of us, black or white, are in that league.) That may be why travel patterns are still very much shaped by race. According to Mandala, African-Americans are most likely to visit Florida and Georgia. African-Americans and Latinos are more likely than the general American population to seek our historic attractions; three-quarters of African-American leisure travelers say it’s a critical factor in their choices. Group travel is twice as popular among African-Americans than whites, according to Charlie Presley, the founder of the African-American Travel Conference, perhaps pointing to a sense of security in numbers as well as the proliferation of black interest clubs and professional groups. These clubs help drive black tourism, exposing us to new destinations. Ms. Lee, for example, said that when she made a rare trip to Utah (which is less than 2 percent African-American) with the National Black Ski Association (a.k.a. National Brotherhood of Skiers), “I was pleasantly surprised by the Utahans’ friendly reception of our color-full group. The N.B.S. members typically boost local economies to the tune of $3 million during their weeklong summits.” And bloggers are also pushing black Americans to get out and see our country in all its natural glory. Barry and Cindy Rock, originally from Boston and now living in Georgia, run the site Camping in Color (campingincolor.blogspot.com), which addresses the specific fears about what it’s like to camp — a fear that can encompass both nature and other campers. “I think most folks need to just relax a little bit because everywhere you go in this country you’ll come across somebody who doesn’t like you,” Mr. Rock said. “They may give you a dirty look, but that’s not something that’s going to stop us from enjoying our country.” He continued: “We [black Americans] are as much a part of this country, maybe even more, than a lot of people who are here now so we have the right, and we’re going to take the right, to go anywhere we want to go.” The couple blogs about African-American culture and community throughout the country as well as the pleasures of being outdoors. They’ve since taken scores of friends and family members into the woods, and created a wide circle of explorers via their own trips and their blog. Plenty rely on advice from bloggers like the Rocks, Ms. Lee and Mr. Gross. But often, the circle of explorers on the road grows organically, without any digital intervention, the way it always has. Beandrea July, an artist based in Washington, found that as she traveled in Kauai in 2008, the road opened before her. “I forced my introvert self to go to the farmers’ market around the corner and chat with some people. In so doing I scored an invitation and a ride that night to a barbecue on a fruit farm.” She met another black American on a bus, and the two women traveled throughout the Hawaiian island. “While eating dinner one day, this black guy walked by, and we all looked at each other,” she said. “About an hour later he was taking us out in his kayaks for a tour. This trip was all about abundance, and asking and receiving.” Advertisement For those of us blacks who travel — domestically or internationally, with financial ease or by saving for years — the world can be our playground, our teacher, our beloved. We just have to remember one thing I was lucky enough to learn as a child, and one that I was reminded of in Beijing that fall day. This world can be our place, too.

Business   Daniel Finkel’s Stained Glass Window Problem. Advertisement In this week’s puzzle by Daniel Finkel we continue to follow an itinerant nun who most recently made her way to a shrine in the holy town of Duona. We now join her in some construction work. Having reached the shrine (see Pilgrim’s Puzzle), the pilgrim is put to work making stained glass windows. Following doctrine, she is told to create a frame for the window by connecting the midpoints of a square. Later, the frame is filled in with colored glass. After spending several days building identical frames, she goes to the supervising nun. Pilgrim: Can’t we build the frame in some other way? Supervising Nun: It is written that for these windows, we must connect a point on each side of the square to make a four-sided shape. It is also written that this shape must take up exactly half the square. Verily, as the outside square contains 16 squares, so must the area of the four-sided figure created inside be equal to 8 squares. Pilgrim: But surely there are other ways to do it! I’ve been connecting 2, 5, 8 and 11 over and over. Couldn’t I try 1, 4, 7 and 10, or 1, 6, 9 and 12? I’m sure that there are other ways to take up half the square. Supervising Nun: A novice once tried to convince us that 1, 6, 8 and 11 occupied 8 square units. In reviewing the design we determined it occupied only 7.5. The novice was expelled, and her window frame destroyed. You may investigate the issue on your own time, but violating the doctrine is prohibited. Can the pilgrim find another four-sided shape that touches each side of the square at one of the numbered points and takes up exactly half the area of the original square? If so, how many such four-sided figures are there? That completes this week’s puzzle. Daniel Finkel and his partner Katherine Cook make up the Seattle-based team Math for Love, which believes every student should experience the thrill of mathematical discovery, and very teacher can appreciate the elegance of a great mathematical insight. Math for Love is out to change the culture of mathematics, and they’re starting with love. They’re also out to break things. Here’s Dr. Finkel with a resolution for the new year: Let’s talk about breaking mathematics. We are taught to believe that math is a magical alchemical process. There are these delicate procedures, and you have to sprinkle in exactly the right elements in exactly the right way, spin a black cat around your head, and if you do everything perfectly then you get to find out what 4/5 of 75 is, or what the derivative of (sin x)(cos x) is. The right answer, we’re taught, emerges only if you cast the spell exactly right; if you don’t do them right, well, then dead end. The truth is, this is dead-end thinking. Math isn’t magic and it’s not a religion. And the quickest way to find this out, and take control of your education, is to start breaking the rules. What does this mean in practice? Question, push, doubt conventional wisdom, and encourage your students and children to do the same. That’s what the Pilgrim is doing in this puzzle. She’s given a procedure with one “right” way of doing it, and pushes to see if it can be done another way. And there’s no limit to how far we can go. If our original puzzle uses a square, would it still work for a rectangle? How could you pose the question using a triangle, or a cube? These questions can be tough, but that’s the point: we break math, and then we put it together in more powerful configurations. That’s my New Year’s resolution: break as much mathematics as possible this year. As always — use Gary Hewitt’s Enhancer to increase your breaking ability.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 7. Advertisement   PARIS — Varied are the uses of the telephone, and strange, occasionally, are the misuses to which the apparatus is put. In a case just heard before a Paris Correctional Court, it has even been used as a means for attempting blackmail. It is so easy to call up a number and tell a person that unless certain funds are forthcoming certain disagreeable things will happen. There are no witnesses — unless the person to be blackmailed keeps a bailiff on hand. This is what the plaintiff in the action just heard did. When the threats were repeated the bailiff duly and legally noted them and recognized the voice.  The would-be blackmailer was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. 1964: ‘Life’ Style on the President WASHINGTON — The United States is using the most advanced techniques of the slick magazine media to help introduce President Johnson to the world. In a few weeks the U.S. Information Agency hopes to have a 64-page ‘‘Life’’ magazine-style publication in the hands of people in 105 nations and in 40 languages. The publication, titled ‘‘The President of the United States of America,’’ is the most ambitious production of its kind since the USIA put out a smaller magazine when the Communists erected the Berlin wall.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Business   Oscar, a New Health Insurer, Raises $30 Million. Advertisement Most of the darlings of the last few years have been consumer-focused start-ups, like Instagram and Warby Parker. But a group of investors, including the venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, are doubling down on a bet on health insurance. Oscar, a health insurer co-founded by Mr. Kushner, has raised $30 million in new capital from existing investors, the firm plans to disclose this week. The financing was led by the Founders Fund, the venture capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. It also includes Mr. Kushner’s firm, Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst Partners. Open for business since October, the company has grown rapidly. The newest fund-raising round, which comes after an initial round of about $35 million, values the insurer at roughly $340 million. Mr. Kushner will remain chairman, while his co-founders, Kevin Nazemi and Mario Schlosser, will run the firm day to day. It’s an unusual bet that technology can transform one of the stodgiest industries around: health insurance. While Oscar’s fundamental business model doesn’t upend the traditional insurance industry playbook, the three are betting that a service provider can thrive on being friendlier and easier to use. “Our ethos and mission is to create a good consumer experience,” Mr. Kushner said in an interview. “We wanted to create an experience like having a doctor in the family.” For now, Oscar only serves New York City and a few other counties in lower New York State. But Mr. Kushner said that the firm was aiming to eventually expand across the country, a process made easier by already being licensed in one state. Oscar still charges deductibles and monthly payments. But the company focuses on offering other services intended to make life easier for patients, including free generic drugs, free calls to doctors and a handful of free primary care appointments. The start-up also focuses on design and technology, including an online search function that lets patients type in their symptoms in natural language, then being steered to a doctor that suits their needs. To Mr. Kushner, such services are meant to undercut the idea of insurance companies as faceless middlemen. “People just don’t have a relationship with this kind of entity,” he said. “The existing players don’t care about satisfying the customer.” The company’s services are currently available only through New York State’s health insurance exchange, though Mr. Kushner said that the technical troubles of healthcare.gov haven’t hurt business. It’s unclear whether a shinier, friendlier insurer can translate into profit, though Mr. Kushner said Oscar already had thousands of customers and tens of millions of dollars in revenue. While the company has already raised more than $75 million in its short existence, people briefed on the matter said that it wasn’t because of a high cash burn. (About $29 million of the insurance provider’s initial fund-raising was set aside for reserves; meanwhile, employees are trying to save money by taking steps like painting the walls of the company’s headquarters themselves.)

Foreign   As Donations Pour In, Aam Aadmi Party Tries to Transform Campaign Finance. Advertisement MUMBAI — The Aam Aadmi Party, having shaken up the political order in India by its surprisingly strong showing in the Delhi state assembly elections last month, is also making an attempt to change the way the country’s political campaigns are financed. When the party first began campaigning in 2012, it promised complete transparency in its finances, creating a website in which the name of the donor is listed, along with the donor’s country of residence, the date and the amount of the donation. These efforts mark a considerable departure from the murky practices considered the norm in electoral finance in India. “It’s the first time there has been this level of transparency in fund-raising by a political party in India,” said E. Sridharan, academic director at the University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India in New Delhi, who has written extensively about electoral finance. The party says that its financial transparency is intended to differentiate Aam Aadmi from the other political parties, which often accept large donations from private enterprises and individual donors. These donors often expect a payback in the form of public sector licenses and favorable regulations. “It was a very conscious decision on the part of the party that we are not going to resort to the usual funding techniques used by political parties, nor are we going to depend on corporates,” said Ankit Lal, social media and IT administrator for the Aam Aadmi Party. While Indian law only requires donations above 20,000 rupees to be made public, the Aam Aadmi Party lists the names of those who give as little as 100 rupees. Also, political parties need to submit their accounts only annually to the Election Commission, but the Aam Aadmi Party has already published their reports of donations on its website. The party has raised 49.5 million rupees, or $794,000, as of Tuesday since its victory in the Delhi state elections in early December. Before the Delhi state elections, the party received an average of 500,000 rupees a day, but currently it is drawing 1.5 million to 2 million rupees a day. For the Delhi elections, over 70,000 individuals donated, of which 55,000 gave 10,000 rupees or less, said Mr. Lal. Nearly 60 percent of the total amount was donated online, where the party has spent much of its fund-raising efforts. Parties can receive an unlimited amount of donations, but for the state elections in December, the party stopped accepting donations on Nov. 17, after it reached its fund-raising goal of 200 million rupees. “We set a campaign cap because we didn’t want to take more money than we needed,” said Mr. Lal. Though the 1-year-old party has found success in fund-raising, the amounts it has received are still small compared what the more established parties have raised in the past. A study by the Association for Democratic Reforms showed that in the 2011-12 financial year, which begins in April, the Congress Party had a total reported income of 3.07 billion rupees and the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., had 1.7 billion rupees. However, the Aam Aadmi Party is willing to reject money if the source doesn’t meet its standards for transparency and honesty. It has turned down donations from certain companies that it deemed as having a less-than-clean track record or from donors whose nationality could not be established. Indians living abroad, also known as nonresident Indians, are allowed to donate to political campaigns in India, but foreign nationals are not. According to the Aam Aadmi Party website, the United States has the highest number of nonresident Indian donors as of Tuesday, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Singapore and Canada. While the average Indian resident donates about 500 rupees, overseas Indians gives an average of 2,000 rupees to the campaign, said Mr. Lal. When India’s Home Ministry ordered an inquiry into allegations of foreign donations to the party in November, the party welcomed the investigation and called on the government to look into each party’s sources of funding. (The inquiry is still pending.) “Political parties have always received money from outside the country,” said Mr. Sridharan. “Some of this money is also being sent out and then being brought back in a round trip through Mauritius. There is money, which is corrupt money, that is taken out of the country to Swiss banks, Mauritius or the Cayman Islands, and being brought back during elections.” In an attempt to encourage traceable contributions, political parties receive tax breaks on the condition that they file audited financial statements. However, several loopholes exist in the current political finance laws. While India bans anonymous donations to political parties, unlimited anonymous donations to individual candidates are allowed. Also, because political parties only have to report donations above 20,000 rupees to the Election Commission, many have claimed that they have received multiple donations of less than 20,000 rupees from the same donor. Campaign donations are widely seen as a channel for illegal money, also known as black money, to be brought into the country. In a study published in September by the nonprofit Association for Democratic Reforms, nearly 75 percent of the funding of Indian political parties comes from unknown sources. “Political funding everywhere in the world is fraught with controversy,” said Jagdeep Chhokar, one of the founders of the Association for Democratic Reforms. “The laws in India are rather dispersed, and therefore it is easy for political parties to avoid giving information about their sources of funding and their expenditure.” In August, the Election Commission proposed making it mandatory for all political parties to issue receipts to each donor, irrespective of the amount donated, and maintain an account of all the receipts that will be audited each year. The commission also suggested that parties deposit all donations in designated bank accounts to keep a check on the use of illegal money. The suggestions have been resisted by most political parties. The Congress Party, which leads the governing coalition in New Delhi, sent a letter to the Election Commission saying that it would prefer to maintain the status quo. Officials from the B.J.P. and the Congress Party did not respond to requests for comment. Samya Chatterjee, a junior fellow specializing in political funding at the Centre for Governance and Politics in Delhi, said it was too early to say whether the Aam Aadmi Party’s actions represent a turning point for campaign finance in India. “But it has already set a higher threshold for transparency in political funding than currently practiced by political parties,” he said. However, other experts in electoral and political funding are skeptical that the Aam Aadmi Party’s practices will lead to a greater transparency in Indian campaign finance. “Political parties cannot afford to start identifying their donors because a lot of this money is kickbacks for government contracts,” said Mr. Sridharan. “The lack of transparency in party funding is directly related to the discretionary and nontransparent nature of government and public enterprise contracting and regulations — which is where corruption happens. Right now, there is a sort of vicious circle that is difficult to break.” One possible solution that has been widely debated is the public funding of campaigns. Currently, the government provides parties accommodation at subsidized rates, income tax exemptions and free air time on state radio and television. “Research shows that one instrument to enhance transparency is direct state funding to parties,” said Sam van der Staak, program manager at the International Institute of Democracy and Electoral Assistance in Stockholm, adding that public funding to parties is now the global norm, with 70 percent of the world’s countries providing it. Additionally, state funding allows the government to insist upon accountability in expenditure and withhold funds in case of noncompliance, he said. “Since political parties will always need money to perform their democratic roles in society, this forces parties to rely on private donations only, many of which come with strings attached,” he said. Mr. Chhokar of the Association for Democratic Reforms said that although public funding has been debated for a long time, it is not likely to be introduced anytime soon. “The bottleneck is that there is no clarity about how much funding is needed because political parties are not willing to share clear expenditure reports,” he said. “Unless it is known how much money is needed, how will they know much public funding to provide.” Regardless of what happens in campaign finance, the Aam Aadmi Party has signaled that it will do things its way. “We wanted to send the message that we are not like normal parties,” Mr. Lal said. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   The Brain, in Exquisite Detail. Advertisement Advertisement The Map Makers By JAMES GORMAN JAN. 6, 2014 Deanna Barch and her colleagues are trying to map connections in the human brain. The study is part of the Human Connectome Project. ST. LOUIS — Deanna Barch talks fast, as if she doesn’t want to waste any time getting to the task at hand, which is substantial. She is one of the researchers here at Washington University working on the first interactive wiring diagram of the living, working human brain. To build this diagram she and her colleagues are doing brain scans and cognitive, psychological, physical and genetic assessments of 1,200 volunteers. They are more than a third of the way through collecting information. Then comes the processing of data, incorporating it into a three-dimensional, interactive map of the healthy human brain showing structure and function, with detail to one and a half cubic millimeters, or less than 0.0001 cubic inches. Dr. Barch is explaining the dimensions of the task, and the reasons for undertaking it, as she stands in a small room, where multiple monitors are set in front of a window that looks onto an adjoining room with an M.R.I. machine, in the psychology building. She asks a research assistant to bring up an image. “It’s all there,” she says, reassuring a reporter who has just emerged from the machine, and whose brain is on display. And so it is, as far as the parts are concerned: cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and all the other regions and subregions, where memories, fear, speech and calculation occur. But this is just a first go-round. It is a static image, in black and white. There are hours of scans and tests yet to do, though the reporter is doing only a demonstration and not completing the full routine. Each of the 1,200 subjects whose brain data will form the final database will spend a good 10 hours over two days being scanned and doing other tests. The scientists and technicians will then spend at least another 10 hours analyzing and storing each person’s data to build something that neuroscience does not yet have: a baseline database for structure and activity in a healthy brain that can be cross-referenced with personality traits, cognitive skills and genetics. And it will be online, in an interactive map available to all. Advertisement Dr. Helen Mayberg, a doctor and researcher at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has used M.R.I. research to guide her development of a treatment for depression with deep brain stimulation, a technique that involves surgery to implant a pacemaker-like device in the brain, is one of the many scientists who could use this sort of database to guide her research. With it, she said, she can ask, “how is this really critical node connected” to other parts of the brain, information that will inform future research and surgery. The database and brain map are a part of the Human Connectome Project, a roughly $40 million five-year effort supported by the National Institutes of Health. It consists of two consortiums: a collaboration among researchers at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, which moved last year to the University of Southern California from U.C.L.A., to improve M.R.I. technology and the $30 million project Dr. Barch is part of, involving Washington University, the University of Minnesota and the University of Oxford. Dr. Barch is a psychologist by training and inclination who has concentrated on neuroscience because of the desire to understand severe mental illness. Her role in the project has been in putting together the battery of cognitive and psychological tests that go along with the scans, and overseeing their administration. This is the information that will give depth and significance to the images. JAN. 8, 2014 She said the central question the data might help answer was, “How do differences between you and me, and how our brains are wired up, relate to differences in our behaviors, our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings, our experiences?” And, she added, “Does that help us understand how disorders of connectivity, or disorders of wiring, contribute to or cause neurological problems and psychiatric problems?” The Human Connectome Project is one of a growing number of large, collaborative information-gathering efforts that signal a new level of excitement in neuroscience, as rapid technological advances seem to be bringing the dream of figuring out the human brain into the realm of reality. Worldwide Study In Europe, the Human Brain Project has been promised $1 billion for computer modeling of the human brain. In the United States last year, President Obama announced an initiative to push brain research forward by concentrating first on developing new technologies. This so-called Grand Challenge has been promised $100 million of financing for the first year of what is anticipated to be a decade-long push. The money appears to be real, but it may come from existing budgets, and not from any increase for the federal agencies involved. A vast amount of research is already going on — so much that the neuroscience landscape is almost as difficult to encompass as the brain itself. The National Institutes of Health alone spends $5.5 billion a year on neuroscience, much of it directed toward research on diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Advertisement A variety of private institutes emphasize basic research that may not have any immediate payoff. For instance, at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Janelia Farm in Virginia, part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and at numerous universities, researchers are trying to understand how neurons compute — what the brains of mice, flies and human beings do with their information. The Allen Institute is now spending $60 million a year and Janelia Farm about $30 million a year on brain research. The Kavli Foundation has committed $4 million a year for 10 years, and the Salk Institute in San Diego plans to spend a total of $28 million on new neuroscience research. And there are others in the U.S. and abroad. To be sure, this is not the first time such a focus has been placed on brain research. The 1990s were anointed the decade of the brain by President George H. W. Bush. Strides were made, but many aspects of the brain have remained mysterious. There is, however, a good reason for the current excitement, and that is accelerating technological change that the most sanguine of brain mappers compare to the growing ability to sequence DNA that led to the Human Genome Project. Optogenetics is one new technique that has been transformative. It uses light to turn on different parts of the brain in laboratory animals to open and shut modified genes. Powerful developments in microscopy made possible movies of brain activity in living animals. A modified rabies virus can target one brain cell and mark every other cell that is connected to it. “There is an explosion of new techniques,” said Dr. R. Clay Reid, a senior investigator at the Allen Institute, who recently moved there from Harvard Medical School. “And the end isn’t really in sight,” said Dr. Reid, who is taking advantage of just about every new technology imaginable in his quest to decipher the part of the mouse brain devoted to vision. Advertisement Charting the Brain Of the many metaphors used for exploring and understanding the brain, mapping is probably the most durable, perhaps because maps are so familiar and understandable. “A century ago, brain maps were like 16th-century maps of the Earth’s surface,” said David Van Essen, who is in charge of the Connectome effort at Washington University, where Dr. Barch works. Much was unknown or mislabeled. “Now our characterizations are more like an 18th-century map.” The continents, mountain ranges and rivers are getting more clearly defined. His hope, he said, is that the Human Connectome Project will be a step toward vaulting through the 19th and 20th centuries and reaching something more like Google Maps, which is interactive and has many layers. Researchers may not be looking for the best sushi restaurants or how to get from one side of Los Angeles to the other while avoiding traffic, but they will eventually be looking for traffic flow, particularly popular routes for information, and matching traffic patterns to the tasks the brain is doing. They will also be asking how differences in the construction of the pathways that make up the brain’s roads relate to differences in behavior, intelligence, emotion and genetics. Advertisement The power of computers and mathematical tools devised for analyzing vast amounts of data made such maps possible. The gathering tool of choice at Washington University is an M.R.I. machine customized at the University of Minnesota. An M.R.I. machine creates a magnetic field surrounding the body part to be scanned, and sends radio waves into the body. Unlike X-rays, which are known to pose some dangers, M.R.I. scans are considered to be safe. It is one of the few methods of noninvasive scanning that can survey a whole human brain. There are a variety of ways to gather and interpret information in an M.R.I. machine. And different types of scans can show both basic structure and activity. When a volunteer is trying to solve a memory problem, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex are all going to be involved. An M.R.I. machine can detect the direction of information flow, in a technique called diffusion imaging. In that kind of scan, the movement of water molecules shows not only activity, but which way the traffic is headed. A Path to Research For Dr. Barch, 48, another kind of interest in the human brain put her on the path to Washington University. “I always knew I wanted to be a psychologist,” she said — specifically, a school psychologist. But as an undergraduate at Northwestern, she excelled in an abnormal psychology class, and the professor recruited her to do research. “When I graduated from college, I decided to become a case manager for the chronically mentally ill for a year to kind of suss out, ‘Do I want to do more clinical work or research?’ ” she said. “That was a great experience, but it really made me realize that research is the only way you’re going to have an impact on many lives, rather than sort of individual lives.” She obtained her Ph.D. in clinical psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. but then did postdoctoral study in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Her years in graduate school in the 1990s coincided with the development and use of the so-called functional M.R.I., which can show not just static structure, but the brain in action. “I got into the field when functional imaging was just at its very beginning, so I was able to learn on the ground floor,” she said. She moved to Washington University after her postdoctoral research partly because of the number of people there working on imaging, including Dr. Marcus E. Raichle, a pioneer in developing ways of watching the brain at work. Advertisement As a professor at Washington University and a leader of one of five teams there working on the Human Connectome Project, Dr. Barch focuses her research on the way individual differences in the brains of healthy people are related to differences in personality or thinking. For instance she said, people doing memory tasks in the M.R.I. machine may differ in competitiveness and commitment to doing well. That ought to show up in activity in the parts of the brain that involve emotion, like the amygdala. However, she points out that the object of the Connectome Project is not to find the answers to these questions, but to provide the database for others to try to do so. ‘Pretty Close’ The project at Washington University requires exhaustive scans of 1,200 healthy people, age 22 to 35, each of whom spends about four hours over two days lying in the noisy, claustrophobia-inducing cylinder of a customized M.R.I. machine. Sometimes they stare at one spot, curl their toes or move their fingers. They might play gambling games, or try memory tests that can flummox even the sharpest minds. “In an ideal world, we would have enough tasks to activate every part of the brain,” she said. “We got pretty close. We’re not perfect, but pretty close.” Over the two days, the research subjects spend another six hours taking other tests designed to measure intelligence, basic physical fitness, tasting ability and their emotional state. The volunteers (and they are all volunteers, paid a flat $400 for their time and effort) can also be seen in street clothes, doing a kind of race around two traffic cones in the sunlit corridor of the glass-walled psychology building, with data collected on how quickly they complete the course. Or they can be glimpsed padding down a hallway in their stocking feet from the M.R.I. machine to an office where a technician dabs their tongues with a swab dipped in a mystery liquid, then asks them to identify the intensity and quality of the taste. In the same office, they type in answers to cognitive tests, and to a psychological survey, for which they are left in solitude because of the personal nature of some of the questions: how they feel about life, how often they are sad. The results are confidential, as are all the test results. Advertisement So far almost 500 subjects have gone through the full range of tests, which amounts to about 5,000 hours of work for Dr. Barch and others in the program. So far, data has been released for 238 subjects, and it is available to everyone for free through a web-based database and software program called Workbench. The sharing of data is characteristic of most of the new brain research efforts, and particularly important to Dr. Barch. “The amount of time and energy we’re spending collecting this data, there’s no possible way any one research group could ever use it to the extent that justifies the cost,” she said. “But letting everybody use it — great!” The Elusive Brain No one expects the brain to yield its secrets quickly or easily. Neuroscientists are fond of deflecting hope even as they point to potential success. Science may come to understand neurons, brain regions, connections, make progress on Parkinson’s. Alzheimer’s or depression, and even decipher the code or codes the brain uses to send and store information. But, as any neuroscientist sooner or later cautions in discussing the prospects for breakthroughs, we are not going to “solve the brain” anytime soon — not going to explain consciousness, the self, the precise mechanisms that produce a poem. Perhaps the greatest challenge is that the brain functions and can be viewed at so many levels, from a detail of a synapse to brain regions trillions of times larger. There are electrical impulses to study, biochemistry, physical structure, networks at every level and between levels. And there are more than 40,000 scientists worldwide trying to figure it out. This is not a case of an elephant examined by 40,000 blindfolded experts, each of whom comes to a different conclusion about what it is they are touching. Everyone knows the object of study is the brain. The difficulty of comprehending the brain may be more aptly compared to a poem by Wallace Stevens, “13 Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.” Each way of looking, not looking, or just being in the presence of the blackbird reveals something about it, but only something. Each way of looking at the brain reveals ever more astonishing secrets, but the full and complete picture of the human brain is still out of reach. There is no need, no intention and perhaps no chance, of ever “solving” a poet’s blackbird. It is hard to imagine a poet wanting such a thing. But science, by its nature, pursues synthesis, diagrams, maps — a grip on the mechanism of the thing. We may not solve the brain any time soon, but someday achieving such a solution, at least in scientific terms, is the fervent hope of neuroscience. An article on Tuesday about efforts to map the human brain gave outdated information about one of the consortiums that is part of the Human Connectome Project. While the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging used to be based at U.C.L.A., it moved to the University of Southern California last year. Next: Functional connections at a different level. Dr. R. Clay Reid investigates the mouse visual cortex. A version of this article appears in print on January 7, 2014, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Brain, in Exquisite Detail.

Business   Automotive Highlights From C.E.S.. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 8, 2014 ■ Kia’s KND-7 concept, which looks like the CUB concept the company unveiled at the Seoul auto show, made an appearance at the Consumer Electronic Show this week. The KND-7 features suicide rear doors, a 4-seat cabin, something along the bottom of the front doors called turning vanes and a 201-horsepower turbocharged gasoline engine. (Kia) ■ Lucas di Grassi, the Brazilian Formula One driver, put on a show for journalists covering the show on Monday, driving the all-electric Spark-Renault Formula E car, the SRT_01E, in its first dynamic public demonstration. Di Grassi performed a series of (not-so-smoky) doughnuts and skidding stops. (Renault) ■ BMW said it would also introduce new technology in Las Vegas this week, including an automated car that integrates electronically controlled steering with automated brakes for greater control, as well as a camera-based adaptive cruise control that eliminates the need for more costly radar-based systems. As Hyundai integrated its products with Google Glass for the show, BMW says it will blend the Samsung Galaxy Gear with its systems. (BMW) ■ Audi announced Tuesday that it would introduce a TT with a sleek new interior featuring an all-digital instrument cluster that the automaker said eliminated the need for a multimedia interface display in the center of the dash. Audi says the instrument panel will look like an airplane wing and the climate control vents like jet nozzles, giving the cabin an aerospace feel. (Audi) ■ Audi also displayed a commuter-themed exhibit at the show, a look at the needs of big-city commuters called the Audi Urban Future Initiative. Audi showcased technologies such as smartphone-assisted car-to-public transit transitions and cars that park themselves, and questioned what could be done to improve interfaces among car, public transit and pedestrian commuters. (Audi) Advertisement ■ Assuming a practice usually reserved for software companies, Ford announced in Las Vegas on Tuesday that it would hold a developers conference in Dearborn, Mich., this June. The automaker said it would invite companies to create apps for its Sync AppLink system. The company also introduced a partnership with Dominos Pizza that would allow Ford customers to order pizza using voice commands. (Ford) ■ Toyota says that its hydrogen fuel-cell Car of the Future will be reasonably priced, have a 300-mile range and a three- to five-minute fill-up time. Although the car was camouflaged, it was shown with the Toyota FCV concept at the show. Toyota offered few other details, but said the car would be available for sale next year.

Foreign   Colonial Ghosts Continue to Haunt France. Advertisement Advertisement By ADAM NOSSITERJAN. 10, 2014 DAKAR, Senegal — In the paternalist universe of France and a dozen-odd former African colonies, its stifling embrace of the Central African Republic is unique, a century-old hug both protective and deadly. That special relationship is playing out now as France finds itself stuck in a quagmire decades in the making — and one in which France, indirectly at least, has had a hand. The weight of a brutal colonial past and its meddling post-colonial sequel underpin Operation Sangaris, a peacekeeping mission other European countries, and the United States, are so far happy to leave to the French. And perhaps for good reason. For the moment, the 1,600 French troops in the country have kept Muslim and Christian factions uneasily at bay and reduced violence that has killed an estimated 1,000 people and driven more than 900,000 from their homes; as many as 100,000 are camped out at the airport in the capital, Bangui, seeking the protection of French and other troops. The feared genocide — a warning term used by French officials in Paris and at the United Nations last fall — has so far not materialized. But genocide, real or imagined, always had less to do with the reality of a French intervention than with seeking short-term support for it. The underlying reasons have more to do with a long-term bond that has seen French troops deployed in the Central African Republic seven times in just over 30 years, including on three occasions in 1996 — to the point that some French commentators have termed the latest one merely inevitable. This time, for eight months France looked on uneasily as bodies piled up and local hostility toward the Muslim rebel rulers from the north grew. Advertisement Finally, with the large-scale killings of Dec. 5 in Bangui — perhaps precipitated, with some irony, by a scheduled United Nations vote on intervention that day, as local commentators suggested — it could wait no longer. France cannot escape the Central African Republic, and vice versa. More than 15 years ago, a former prime minister, Jean-Paul Ngoupandé, wrote in a despairing memoir that France “needs to question itself, candidly, on its role in the infantilizing of this country.” But long before France’s troops got into the business of making and unmaking rulers, the lands north of the Ubangi River had entered the French conscience. What became the Central African Republic — it was then in French Equatorial Africa — played a central role in forcing the French to recognize the ugly realities of colonial rule across France’s then-vast overseas empire. The devastating travel account of the novelist and essayist André Gide, who traveled through the colony of Oubangui-Chari in 1926-27 and later was awarded a Nobel Prize, caused a scandal when it was first published as “Voyage au Congo,” and it “shocked French opinion in an era when everything was done to hide from the public the negative aspects of the colonial regime,” one of the last French administrators of Oubangui-Chari, Pierre Kalck, wrote years later. Gide had come in search of butterflies and exotic flora and fauna; he stumbled on horrifying accounts of brutality, practiced by French colonial agents, under the thumb of French state-chartered companies exploiting rubber and other resources. Not far from Bangui, inhabitants told the writer of exemplary “punishments” inflicted for not obeying orders or failing to bring in the rubber quotient: men tied to trees and shot, women massacred with machetes, children shut up in a hut and burned alive, men forced to carry huge beams while walking in a circle for hours in broiling heat until they dropped. “Alas, this ‘ballroom scene’ was not, I fear, exceptional in the least,” Gide wrote. “Sleep is impossible for me,” he continued. “An enormous groan now possesses me; Now I know things I feel powerless to do anything about. What demon drove me to Africa?” he wrote. “For now, I know; and I must speak out.” In systematic and until then largely unacknowledged state-sanctioned violence, France had tied itself, for ill and good, to the country’s future. It is a troubled and unequal partnership that is still working itself out. A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Business   Review: Wearable Filip Phone/Tracker. Advertisement Advertisement By ROY FURCHGOTTJAN. 9, 2014 Tracking devices make me uneasy, but I have to defer to parental paranoia, which requires knowing where your children are. A watch/tracker/phone, Filip, may help. I find Filip less odious that most tracking devices. This may be partly because of the bright colors and appealingly goofy oversize design. Available in red, hot pink, bright green and blue, it has a chunky charm. To use the phone, you install the free Filip app on a parent’s Android or iOS device. Then you link to the Filip itself. You can follow the locations of up to five of the Filip devices. You can also set a “safe zone,” which is the distance a Filip can travel before your phone receives an alert. The Times’s Nick Bilton takes a look at smartwatches at the International CES in Las Vegas. You can store multiple zones for each child (your house, a friend’s across town, Grandma’s in another state). The zones are circular, which could be a problem for some; for example, I might allow a child to venture four blocks north, east and west from my house, but four blocks south would put him in the Baltimore Harbor. Parents can use the phone app to send a text message to Filip’s watch face (Call me now!), or place a call to the Filip, which has a speaker phone built in (so be careful what you say). Advertisement The Filip can store five contact numbers. The red call button also acts as an emergency button; when held for three seconds, it starts by calling the person you have as the main contact. If that person doesn’t answer, it will call each contact sequentially until someone picks up. But it can’t be programmed to call 911 as one of the numbers. Dispatches from the International CES in Las Vegas. So far it’s a lot like a phone tracking app, but there is one advantage: You don’t have to worry about your children using Filip to browse the web, because it can’t. Similarly, no texting. There are certainly a few drawbacks to Filip. One is that the batteries run down pretty quickly, so be sure to get it on a charger overnight. Good luck if your child is on a sleepover. I also wonder about the slip-on open bracelet design. Wouldn’t a strap be more secure? Finally, there is the cost. At $200, there are good phones that are less expensive. In addition to the price of the device, there is a $36 activation fee and a $10 monthly fee. Filip may quell some parental worries, even if it’s not the perfect electronic nanny, but I suppose that’s why it’s called Filip, not Mary Poppins. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Senator Signals Support for Sending Helicopters to Iraq. Advertisement Advertisement By PETER BAKER and ERIC SCHMITTJAN. 8, 2014 WASHINGTON — A powerful Senate Democrat signaled Wednesday that he might allow the transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters to Iraq as the government in Baghdad struggles to recapture key territory seized by Islamic extremists in the western part of the country. The senator, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has blocked the lease and sale of the powerful attack helicopters for months while seeking assurances that Iraq would not use them to attack civilians and that the government in Baghdad would take steps to stop Iran from using Iraqi airspace to ship arms to Syria’s military. Mr. Menendez received a three-page letter last week from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq responding to his concerns and received an urgent call from the State Department on Tuesday promising a further response. Although committee officials said the answers so far do not go much further than Mr. Maliki or the administration have in the past, Mr. Menendez was convinced that they are serious about dealing with the concerns given the latest strife in Anbar Province. “The administration is now addressing concerns first raised in July that required responses before this sale could proceed,” said Adam Sharon, the senator’s spokesman. “Provided these issues are sufficiently addressed, Chairman Menendez will be ready to move forward.” The Obama administration has proposed selling 20 to 30 of the helicopters to the Iraqi government, but, because it could take years for them to be built, it has also asked to lease up to 10 aircraft in the interim. Administration officials said the Apaches could be useful in targeting fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda like those who have taken over parts of Fallujah and Ramadi in recent days. But even if Mr. Menendez dropped his objections, it could take until April to deliver them, and officials noted that pilots would still need to be trained. Advertisement Moreover, other senators remain concerned. “I think we have to be very careful,” said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. “All of that could fall into the wrong hands.” The administration is separately planning to provide an additional shipment of Hellfire missiles as early as this spring, seeing them as effective at denying Al Qaeda a haven in Anbar. In addition, the administration plans to send Iraq 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones in coming weeks and 48 Raven surveillance drones later in the year. Those come on top of Aerostat surveillance balloons provided to Iraq in September and three additional Bell IA-407 helicopters sent last month. Still, even some senior Democrats who support reinforcing Iraqi troops said Mr. Maliki ultimately bore the burden for crafting a long-term political solution with Sunnis in restive Anbar Province. “You could tactically go in with enough force to displace Al Qaeda, but the long-term success is based on the politics,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. “Maliki has to help himself out.” Go to Home Page »
Home   The Rubber Duckie Has Hit the Road. Advertisement Advertisement By SANDY KEENANJAN. 9, 2014 There’s a bit of a shocker coming out of the inaugural “2014 Winter Bathroom Trends Study” just released by Houzz, the home remodeling and design website. Bathtubs appear to be out of favor. More than 4 in 10 respondents said they were leaving them out of their new master bathrooms; among respondents 55 and older, more than half are going tub-less. “That was the biggest surprise,” said Liza Hausman, Houzz’s vice president for community and marketing. “I would never do that.” Houzz emailed the 37-question survey to all of its registered users. Ninety-three percent of the 7,645 who responded said they were either planning or undergoing a bathroom redo. Among that group, about 25 percent said they were enlarging the original footprint of their bathrooms and 55 percent intended to put in double sinks. For walls, paint trumped tile by 47 to 33 percent, and traditional styling edged out contemporary bathrooms (like the one above) by less than 1 percent. Some preferences correlated with age. “Older homeowners want a hand-held spray; younger ones want a body spray” coming off the wall, Ms. Hausman said. Study results are at houzz.com.

Science   The Workout: Speedskating With Eddy Alvarez Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The workout for Eddy Alvarez, a United States Olympic Team short track speedskater, is designed in part to keep his body balanced even though he relies on his left side when skating.  An inside look at fitness routines, by Anahad O’Connor.  Being a successful short-track speedskater is no easy feat. Members of the United States team follow a grueling schedule that involves up to eight hours of training, six days a week. They lift weights, they run and they cycle. And they practice racing around a rink at 40 miles an hour on two razor-sharp blades. We asked Eddy Alvarez, who will be competing in his first Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February, to take us through a speedskater’s workout. Nicknamed Eddy the Jet, Mr. Alvarez, 23, started roller-skating as a child while growing up in Miami, then transitioned to ice. He has won national and World Cup medals in speedskating. But his career was nearly derailed two years ago by devastating knee injuries, which required surgery that left him bedridden for a month. His doctor told him he might never skate again. But Mr. Alvarez bounced back, and he is now considered a top prospect heading into the Olympics. Recently, we caught up with him at the Olympic Oval training facility in Salt Lake City to talk about how he trains six to eight hours a day to prepare for a 42-second race, how a “dino disc” helps prevent injuries and why he is superstitious about what he eats before a competition. Here is an edited version of our conversation. How long have you been skating? I’ve been skating since I was 5; I used to speedskate on inline skates when I was little down in South Beach. I was kind of a side-street attraction. I was even sponsored by a skate shop in Miami. I would wear their logo and jump over boxes and skate around on the streets of South Beach. How did you get into speedskating on ice? Ice was introduced to me at the age of 7. I still remember the first time I tried it. I can’t tell you exactly where it was, but I remember the feeling. It was quite a rush for me as a 7-year-old, gliding and going fast. What are some of the physical demands of the sport? The positions that we’re in on the ice are, honestly, excruciating. We basically skate in a squat position, but what we try to do is become a compact ball. If you watch us skate, you’ll that see our backs are curved. When people ask me how it feels, the best way I can describe it is to say go and do a wall-sit for 10 minutes and then stand up. That’s how it feels. What is a typical day like? I’m in two places every day. I’m either at the Oval training, or I’m at my house sleeping. I know it’ll be worth it in the end, but I really hope I don’t miss my fun years. What are some of your greatest achievements in skating so far? It’s been a very long road. But the biggest accomplishment that I’ve had would be coming back from my injury. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to face. Can you tell us about your injury comeback? I always had knee issues growing up. We thought it was because I grew very fast, very late. But during the 2009-2010 season, it got to a point where I couldn’t finish workouts. I would come home and cry. But I would tell myself to push through it because it was the Olympic season and I had nothing to lose. So I overdid it. I fell short of the 2010 Games and didn’t make the team, and then I finally went to get my knees checked. I got an ultrasound, and it turned out that I had torn the patella tendons in my knees. I had a total of 12 tears in both knees. The doctor was impressed that I was even able to be in skating condition, because my patella tendons were like strings – dangling strings, basically. Can you tell us about the physical preparation that goes into the sport? We put in a lot of hours. We train six to eight hours a day to go race for 42 seconds. The reason we train this much is so our bodies can recover in between rounds of racing. In competitions, we usually skate six or eight rounds in a day, and it’s usually 15 to 20 minutes of rest and then you’re back at it again. It takes a toll on our bodies. Honestly, I always get sick after a competition. That’s how much I put my body through. Unorthodox is the best word to describe our training and our sport. Does it require some muscles more than others? Our sport is very lower-body dominant. The less weight you carry in your upper body, the easier it is. Unfortunately, I carry a little more than everyone else because I have a baseball background. The muscles in my upper body are a little different than the typical short tracker. It sounds like injuries are a big concern. Injuries are huge for us. We are hitting speeds of roughly 40 miles per hour, and there’s falls and crashes. The training takes a toll on our knees, our backs and our hamstrings. At the stage at which we compete, I don’t think there’s an athlete that’s going to be 100 percent physically, with no injuries. We train our bodies every day, and it’s just something that we have to accept. Are there exercises you do to address these issues? We do extra training on the side to strengthen our weaknesses. I like to do exercises on something that we call a “dino disc.” It’s a little rubber disc that has air in it, and when you step on it, it’s like a balance tool. I work a lot with that to strengthen all the little muscles that we don’t have the opportunity to strengthen and activate while we skate. We also do a lot of rubber-band exercises at the beginning of the season to strengthen the knees and the muscles around them. Then we pray that it holds up throughout the season. What are some of your favorite land exercises? We do a lot of jumping exercises, and we do things to develop our accuracy and our foot speed. We’re trying to simulate what we do on the ice. So you’ll find us doing exercises like “dry skating,” which is basically just straight-away pushes on land to simulate the lactic acid that we build in our legs. And we do something called turn-belt exercises, where they strap a long belt around your waist that looks like a seatbelt, and then you have someone else holding the belt as you’re simulating the lean that we have on the ice. What about cardio? We do a lot of cycling and running. We run or bike for 45 minutes to an hour two to three days a week, and during the summer we do four-hour bike rides twice a week. We ride all the mountains out here in Salt Lake City. What is your approach to diet? I try to cook and eat at home as much as possible so I can control the amount and type of oils I eat. One thing I like to use is coconut oil. I’m also a big fan of juicing vegetables. I absolutely hate eating them. So I stick them in a juicer with some fruit like an apple to sweeten it up and I chug it. Some days, we just have to eat and eat and eat to be able to perform. We don’t want to sell ourselves short by not eating enough. We slice through body fat, and we have to fuel our bodies. You’re not going to find me at McDonald’s or Wendy’s. But I like to eat pasta and bread and carbs. Are there certain foods you like to eat before a race or training? I have a superstition. I don’t like to eat red meat before a competition. When I was little, I was always told that red meat is hard to process and sits in your stomach. So during competitions I only eat chicken. I have this thought that the red meat will just sit in my stomach and make me heavier. So I eat chicken during competitions, and some white rice and pasta. What will it mean to you to compete in Sochi? I dream about standing on that podium, winning a medal. It would be such an accomplishment for me because of everything I had to go through. After my surgery, I went through depression. I wasn’t on the ice for 24 months. It’s been a long road for me, and it would mean a lot for my family. They’ve been there every step of the way. I owe it all to them, and if I succeed, the satisfaction of them being happy is the most important thing in the world to me. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.

Washington   Two House Democrats Announce Retirement. Advertisement Advertisement By SARAH WHEATONJAN. 8, 2014 WASHINGTON — Two House Democrats, Carolyn McCarthy of New York, and Mike McIntyre of North Carolina, on Wednesday announced plans to retire. While Mrs. McCarthy’s seat is likely to stay in Democratic hands, Mr. McIntyre’s district, which includes Wilmington and other parts of eastern North Carolina, is an almost certain pickup for Republicans. After 18 years in Congress, Mr. McIntyre said in a news release, he is ready for a “new chapter” in his life. Republicans saw evidence of Democrats’ vulnerability over the health care law in Mr. McIntyre’s announcement, which comes on the heels of a decision by Representative Jim Matheson, Democrat of Utah, to retire from the House. Yet Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Matheson both voted against the Affordable Care Act. “This retirement announcement also proves that Obamacare and its negative impact continues to burden Democrats in 2014 — even for Democrats who voted against the law like McIntyre and Matheson,” said Representative Greg Walden, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. “When these two throw in the towel, you have to wonder who is next, especially among those Democrats in similar districts who backed Obamacare and other reckless policies.” Yet so far, only three Democrats have announced they will not seek re-election, compared to nine Republicans. Of those, said Representative Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commettiee, six open up “competitive seats in which Republicans will fight a bitter primary to the right and Democrats will nominate strong, problem-solving candidates.” Advertisement Mrs. McCarthy, one of the most ardent advocates in Congress for gun control, announced her decision on the third anniversary of the shooting that left former Representative Gabrielle Giffords with a severe brain injury and killed six in Tucson. Mrs. McCarthy’s husband, Dennis, was killed in a mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, leading her to become a gun-control activist. Three years later, she ran for public office, switching parties and becoming a Democrat to challenge a Republican who had voted to repeal the federal assault weapons ban. She won, 57 percent to 41 percent. Retirement is “something I’ve been thinking about really for quite a long time,” Mrs. McCarthy said in a telephone interview. She announced in June that she had lung cancer and recently underwent chemotherapy to treat it. She said that new advocates for gun control — including Ms. Giffords and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York — have joined the campaign. “With, unfortunately, my diagnosis of cancer, and I just turned 70 on Sunday, it’s time for their voices to be heard.” Over her nine terms, she has since seen the assault weapons ban expire, and only one of her major efforts to tighten gun restrictions passed: a bill to significantly improve instant background checks. Mrs. McCarthy said she was naïve when she first came to Congress, believing it would be easier to pass gun legislation. “I got the conversation going,” she said.

Business   Dropbox Says Site Down After Maintenance Error, Not From Hackers. Advertisement   But the company said that the site went down because of a problem that arose during regular maintenance, not because it was compromised by hackers. The site was back up before midnight on Friday. “Today’s outage was caused during internal maintenance, and was not caused by external factor,” a company spokeswoman said in an email. “We apologize for any inconvenience.” Still, hackers tried to claim credit, saying the error was the result of a security vulnerability in the website. Hackers who call themselves AnonOpsKorea, a Korean offshoot of Anonymous, said one of their affiliates, using the Twitter handle 1775Sec, was responsible. In a post on Twitter, that individual said the attack was intended to avenge the death of Aaron Swartz, the renowned programmer and charismatic technology activist who committed suicide last year while facing a federal trial on charges of hacking into the M.I.T. computer network. The hacker claimed to have compromised Dropbox’s site using a security vulnerability and threatened to dump Dropbox data if the company did not plug the hole that allowed for the site compromise. “We are giving you time to fix your websites vulnerability. If it’s not fixed expect a Database leak!,” 1775Sec tweeted. Later, the hacker offered a link to what it said was a partial leak of information. But Dropbox said the information was posted a month ago and wasn’t the company’s information. The Dropbox spokeswoman said there was no loss of customer information. “In regards to claims of ‘leaked user information’ – this is a hoax,” she said. “This is not Dropbox data.” Quentin Hardy contributed reporting.

The most surprising development is the change in the ownership of the ‘‘Daily Mirror,’’ which, although a separate company from the ‘‘Daily Mail’’ and Associated Newspapers, was under the direct wing of Lord Northcliffe, who held the bulk of the shares. Many hundred thousands of dollars have been sunk trying to attract English readers to yellow journalism, and the efforts have resulted in badly burned fingers to the promotor. 1939: Mysterious Roar Over Brooklyn BROOKLYN — There was terror in the Brooklyn air last night [Jan. 9]. It caused the greatest mass fright since the too- real broadcast of a ‘‘Martian Invasion’’ but there is no indictment against the radio this time — in fact the mystery is as enveloping as was the terror. A weird noise, called by some ‘‘a big noise’’ that ‘‘flew, like a cloud’’ over Queens, raised hair and goose flesh on burghers in several wards. It was a vibrating sound like that of a distant airplane. It increased in intensity and pitch until it drowned out the rumble of traffic and all but muffled the wail of police sirens. Then the noise faded to a distant purr.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Science   Tonics and Teas Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Last week, in the course of cleaning out my office and downsizing my cookbook library, I came across an interesting book called “Tonics” by Robert A. Barnett. The book is a collection of recipes, not just for liquid tonics, but for all sorts of dishes made with foods and herbs thought to improve well being. It was a rare cold day in Los Angeles and I was inspired by the book to make some tonics of my own: hot infusions made with ingredients I had on hand in my pantry and produce basket. I brewed and tasted, and thought of the founders of Celestial Seasonings tea company, who in the late 1960s and early ‘70s had come up with such household favorites as Red Zinger and Sleepytime Tea doing just what I was doing. I didn’t work with herbs. I was thinking more along the lines of fruit, perfume and spice, and I had many ingredients that had been languishing in my pantry that came to mind. Take the rose petals and the barberries I had bought at my Iranian market and used in a few savory dishes; and the bags of dried fruits that I never seemed to use up. I also wanted to use turmeric, which is believed to offer many health benefits, in some of my teas, and I loved the results when I added a small amount to a lemon infusion and to a coconut and ginger tea. I won’t be starting a tea company with these new drinks, but I will be making them through the winter, and when hot weather arrives I’ll enjoy them iced. Barberry and Orange Tea: A delicious drink made with sour, zingy, vitamin C-rich dried fruit. Rose Petal and Vanilla Tea: A sweet infusion made with just water and three ingredients. Meyer Lemon and Ginger Infusion With Turmeric and Cayenne: You might want to reach for this tea if you feel a sore throat coming on.  Dried Apricot, Cherry and Cranberry Infusion: Simmering dried fruit with some sweet spices results in a great beverage for a snowy day.

Sports   N.F.L. Divisional Playoff Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 10, 2014 Saints at Seahawks 4:35 p.m. Saturday, Fox Line: Seahawks by 8 The term Beast Mode entered the national vernacular three years ago, when Seattle’s Marshawn Lynch executed one of the most memorable runs in N.F.L. history. During a wild-card game against New Orleans, Lynch broke several tackles for a 67-yard touchdown run. His vicious stiff-arm, which seemed like something out of a video game, shoved cornerback Tracy Porter nearly 4 yards out of the way. Although the game was played in Seattle, the Seahawks’ victory was considered a major upset because they had won the N.F.C. West with a 7-9 record. Now Seattle, which went 13-3 this season, is the favorite, especially after thoroughly embarrassing the Saints in a 34-7 win in Week 13. The Seahawks finally proved to be mortal at home, losing to Arizona in Week 16, but they have few weaknesses. On offense Russell Wilson is a contender for most valuable player and Lynch can wear out a defensive line. On defense, Richard Sherman leads the best secondary in the N.F.L. even though Brandon Browner has been suspended indefinitely. Last weekend, New Orleans (11-5 in the regular season) won a playoff game on the road for the first time. But rain and temperatures near 50 were in Saturday’s forecast, weather that is hardly conducive to the Saints’ fast-paced style. To win, they will have to find their own version of Beast Mode. That may be too tall a task. Advertisement Pick: Seahawks Colts at Patriots 8:15 p.m. Saturday, CBS Line: Patriots by 7 To rally from a 28-point deficit, a team has to play poorly enough to be down by 28 points. That is just what Andrew Luck and Indianapolis did in last weekend’s 45-44 win against Kansas City. Put in a hole largely created by Luck’s three interceptions, the Colts turned the game around and stunned the Chiefs. The sloppy play was somewhat typical of Luck’s rookie year, but he matured quite a bit this season. He has guided Indianapolis to consecutive 11-5 records, and should not be as careless with the ball in this game. New England’s defense is strongest at cornerback, with Logan Ryan and Aqib Talib capable of big plays. But injuries have depleted the Patriots’ depth at linebacker, making the middle of the field an easier place for Indianapolis to work. When the Colts are on defense, they will have to hope that Robert Mathis, the N.F.L.’s leader with 19 ½ sacks, can get to Tom Brady early and often to hide their injury-depleted and underwhelming defense. The Patriots, who were 12-4 in the regular season, are big favorites at home and have the veteran leaders to take care of business. But a road playoff win would add to Luck’s growing reputation as a big-game quarterback. Pick: Colts 49ers at Panthers 1:05 p.m. Sunday, Fox Line: 49ers by 1 This matchup of dynamic young quarterbacks will overshadow the fact that two of the N.F.L.’s best defenses will do their best to contain them. San Francisco is known for its dominant front seven, including four of the league’s best defenders in Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman, Justin Smith and Aldon Smith. The 49ers’ secondary is not quite as strong, but cornerback Tramaine Brock had a breakout season and proved a tremendous upgrade from the injured Chris Culliver. And if Carlos Rogers’s hamstring allows him to play, the defense has few weak spots. Carolina does not yet have the reputation, but its defense, led by the standout linebacker Luke Kuechly, ranked ahead of the 49ers’ in yards and points allowed this season. The Panthers’ stellar secondary was aided greatly by a front seven that contributed an N.F.L.-best 60 sacks, including 15 by Greg Hardy. In Week 10, Carolina beat the 49ers in San Francisco by shutting down their offense. But since Week 12, the 49ers have found a different gear, buoyed greatly by finally having healthy wide receivers. They each finished the regular season 12-4. Advertisement The Panthers look like a force for years to come. But at this point, the 49ers have more options on offense, and the team with more playoff experience should be able to win on the road. Pick: 49ers Chargers at Broncos 4:40 p.m. Sunday, CBS Line: Broncos by 10 Whoever thinks San Diego is just happy to be in the playoffs has never watched Philip Rivers stalk the sideline. His intensity, in wins and losses, has inspired legions of admirers and just as many detractors. Rivers’s style of play, big on yards but also prone to mistakes, can be polarizing as well. The only thing everyone agrees on is that his bolo tie was something to behold during a postgame interview last weekend. Although Rivers can win or lose a game by himself, the Chargers’ defense proved more than up to the challenge of handling Denver this season. Peyton Manning led the Broncos (13-3) to an N.F.L.-record 606 points by breaking the records for passing yards and touchdowns. But they split their two games against San Diego and scored fewer than 30 points each time. The only other team to hold Denver under 30 was Kansas City in Week 11. The Broncos are heavily favored for a reason: The Chargers, at 9-7, barely qualified for the playoffs. But the confident Rivers is hardly willing to concede defeat. “This is a heck of a team,” he told reporters, referring to Denver. “It’s rare to play an opponent three times in a season, and being a division opponent, one we know well; they know us well. It’s going to be awesome.” Pick: Broncos Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.

Travel   52 Places to Go in 2014. Advertisement Advertisement Witness a city in transformation, glimpse exotic animals, explore the past and enjoy that beach before the crowds. UPDATED September 5, 2014 A place to meditate on freedom, and the creative life that followed. When Nelson Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island prison, he found inspiration in Cape Town. “We often looked across Table Bay at the magnificent silhouette of Table Mountain,” he said in a speech. “To us on Robben Island, Table Mountain was a beacon of hope. It represented the mainland to which we knew we would one day return.” Cape Town’s importance to Mandela, who made his first address there as a free man, will doubtless draw many visitors in the wake of his death. The country has transformed itself since Mandela’s imprisonment, but there’s still much to be done. Many in Cape Town have been grappling with that challenge, including its creative class, which has been examining whether inspired design can solve some of the issues stemming from years of inequality. The city formally takes up that issue this year during its turn as World Design Capital. Cape Town is celebrating design in all its forms, putting on fashion shows by students and established designers alike, hosting architecture open houses, welcoming the public into artists’ studios and folding the annual visual arts spectacular Design Indaba conference, which took place in February, into the design capital program. Also part of the lineup are locals seeking to rejuvenate impoverished black-majority townships: The Maboneng Lalela Project turns township homes into galleries and performance spaces; Foodpods constructs sustainable farms, giving residents access to healthy produce; and the Langa Quarter project seeks to make the precinct a cultural tourism destination. Cape Town is again reinventing itself, and the world is invited to its renaissance. Facebook Participate The rebirth of a quake-ravaged city. Three years after two large earthquakes devastated central Christchurch, the city is experiencing a rebirth with creativity and wit — thanks to the ingenuity of its hardy residents — and is welcoming tourists back again. Though much of the central city has yet to be rebuilt, entrepreneurs and volunteers are finding surprising ways to make temporary use of empty lots and bring life back to the downtown. The Gap Filler program, begun a couple of months after the first quake in September 2010 and expanded after a more destructive second quake in February 2011, has created a dance floor with coin-operated music and lights and even a nine-hole mini-golf course in vacant lots across the city. The Greening the Rubble campaign has since the 2010 quake been planting temporary gardens on the sites of demolished buildings. To replace the badly damaged 19th-century ChristChurch Cathedral, a magnificent transitional church by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban opened in 2013 with sturdy cardboard tubes for the roof. Businesses are also trickling back downtown. One bar, built inside shipping containers, has a name that encapsulates the spirit of the entire city: Revival. Facebook Participate A glorious new preserve for the public. One hundred and thirty miles north of San Francisco, the moody bluffs of the Mendocino Coast have long been a spectacular place from which to observe marine life: passing humpback whales, sun-happy sea lions, foamy waves strewn with kelp. The incorporation of the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands — nearly 1,300 acres — gives hikers new access to a contiguous 12-mile stretch of coastline and fields of wildflowers, cypress forests and cliff areas (some overlooking dramatic blowholes, pinnacles and sea caves), much of it previously off-limits to the public. And Congressional proposals to include the north coast lands as part of the California Coastal National Monument have passed, which means better protection and more funds for maintenance; plans also exist to extend the California Coastal Trail through the new preserve. Facebook Participate On a rugged shore, Europe at its best. What if you could combine the rugged beauty you’d find on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast with the ruins of an undiscovered Turkey or Greece, all wrapped in the easygoing nature characteristic of rural Italy — at a fraction of the cost? Turns out you can, on the coast of Albania. The roughly Maryland-size country, between Greece and Montenegro, sits about 45 miles east of Italy on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and has limestone-ringed beaches, ancient ruins like Butrint and waterfront inns where you can stay for less than $50 a night. Rampant development threatened to turn it all to concrete in the years after Communism, but a new government took office in 2013 on promises of keeping the coast authentic. Head to villages like Qeparo, within sight of Corfu, where you can kayak past Cold War submarine tunnels, swim by abandoned forts and watch the tide rise during a dinner of fresh fish at an inn called the Riviera. This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap. Facebook Participate Downtown? Really? Yes, thanks to a thriving food scene. Gone is the musty, lifeless, only-open-for-Kings-hockey-games reputation of downtown Los Angeles. While the museums in this corner of the city are thriving (the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art is nearby), the growing dynamism of downtown is the food scene. Most notable is the Grand Central Market, an arcade of over 30 of the best food vendors in the city. Originally built in 1917, the market has been redone in the past year, attracting popular purveyors like G&B Coffee and, soon, Belcampo Meat Co. Just down the street is Alma, which was named the best new restaurant in the country by Bon Appétit magazine. And where there is good food there is good shopping. Stores have added cachet to the neighborhood; an outlet of the fashion label Acne Studios opened in December, and Aesop, a skin-care specialist, in May. Diners and shoppers alike also have a hip place to stay: An Ace Hotel opened early this year. Facebook Participate Africa’s latest conservation success story is a boon for travelers. Namibia’s communal conservancy movement, which pairs sustainable tourism with rural community outreach, has been a much-heralded success: In 2013, the country’s 79 conservancies received the prestigious Gift to the Earth Award from the World Wildlife Fund, and the stunning Namib Sand Sea Desert joined Unesco’s World Heritage list. Options abound for travelers who want to help the effort, including the Desert Rhino Camp, which Wilderness Safaris runs in partnership with the Save the Rhino Trust; the camp directly supports the conservancy, which has reversed dwindling rhino populations. Wilderness Safaris also plans to open the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp, on the Hoanib River in the north. And Namibia’s Tourism Board introduced three self-drive routes this year to point visitors toward less-visited parts of the country. Facebook Participate Epic biodiversity, and a newly renovated railway to get you there. Ecuador is famed as the home of the Galápagos, the beloved islands off the coast that feature mind-boggling wildlife — but the mainland is no slouch either. One of the most biodiverse countries in the world, Ecuador has over 1,600 species of birds, 4,000 kinds of orchids, one of the largest condor shelters on the planet — and one-fifth of the country (including the Galápagos) is protected. And there is a new way to see a good chunk of it: the recently refurbished Tren Crucero. The luxury vintage train starts in Quito (the first city ever to be declared a World Heritage site by Unesco) and travels through the Andes, over snow-capped mountains, past volcanoes, around a harrowing turn called the Devil’s Nose and through the countryside until arriving in the bustling city of Guayaquil. The four-day trip includes an excursion to Cotopaxi National Park — a place where you might see deer, wolves, bears or one of those condors. Facebook Participate Now open: One of the world’s largest caves. Son Doong Cave in the Quang Binh province of central Vietnam is one of the world’s largest caves and is now, for the first time, accessible to tourists, thanks to the tour operator Oxalis. Huge shafts of light penetrate its vast caverns, allowing forests of 100-foot-tall trees to thrive in spaces big enough to accommodate 40-story skyscrapers. Colossal 260-foot stalactites are also present. Monkeys, hornbills and flying foxes have all been spotted in this surreal habitat, first fully explored in 2009. While trips into Son Doong are limited in number (only 220 permits for the year) and to visitors with deep pockets (over $6,000 per trip), the nearby and more affordable Tu Lan Cave is also now open to adventurous travelers. Facebook Participate For Australian panache, go west. Perth, the capital of western Australia, has long been feted for its beaches, laid-back vibe and Aboriginal heritage, but lately Australia’s fourth-largest city is exhibiting the signs of a trendy transformation. Regional wine lists? Check. Modish new restaurants in repurposed spaces like stables (the Stables Bar), cottages (the Old Crow) or a printing press building (the Print Hall)? Check. International celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver, whose Italian spot Jamie’s Italian recently opened? Up-and-coming neighborhoods like Mount Lawley and Northbridge, chockablock with cafes and vintage shops? Check and check. Transformation is evident on a larger scale, too: The Riverside project is infusing the eastern side of the city with parks, shops and housing plazas, while expansion of the new Crown Perth complex includes hotels — Crown Metropol and Crown Promenade — and posh restaurants like Nobu and La Vie Champagne Lounge. Now that first- and business-class lounges have opened at Los Angeles International Airport this year, the national airline Qantas makes it easy to get Down Under in style. Facebook Participate First-class architecture in the Netherlands’ second city. Post-World War II reconstruction has changed the face of one of Europe’s largest ports, where striking, cubed architecture gives shape to the most modern skyline in the country. But it’s not done yet. This is a banner year for ribbon cuttings to celebrate both new and reconfigured space: An overhaul of Rotterdam Centraal  train station in March has already unveiled a new shop-lined pedestrian passageway and the city’s first Starbucks. The renovated Kunsthal museum reopened in February. François Geurds, chef of the two-Michelin-starred restaurant FG, opened another restaurant in January. Come December, the massive arch of the Markthal, whose interior displays 3-D food photographs, becomes the country’s first indoor food hall. Need a launching pad? Check into a brand-new gem: the Rem Koolhaas-designed nhow hotel. Facebook Participate Urban and outdoor pursuits in one (reasonably) compact package. The traveler who wants to do it all should consider Taiwan. This island, roughly the size of the Netherlands, has an easy-to-navigate public transport network that links a cosmopolitan capital with a bounty of natural and man-made wonders. Taipei, whose robust art scene recently earned its selection as the World Design Capital for 2016, has more places to lay your head: A boutique hotel from the homegrown bookstore chain Eslite will join the recent arrivals Mandarin Oriental, Le Meridien and W. All of these should be a convenient base from which to do some sightseeing on 17 bike trails along the shores of Taipei’s many rivers and inlets or to take a foray into the city’s vibrant street food scene with a nightcap at the reservations-only bespoke bar Alchemy, which opened in 2012 to much acclaim. Four hours south by high-speed rail and bus, 70-square-mile Kenting National Park is home to wetlands, white sands, fishing villages and, starting this year, a ferry point for the deep sea fishing and diving paradise of Orchid Island. Up north in Keelung, a new National Museum of Marine Science and Technology has opened, part of a revitalization project at Badouzi Harbor, which is linked to nearby headlands by color-coded walking routes. And it all becomes cheaper to get to later this year, with the launch of budget carriers from China Airlines and TransAsia Airways. Facebook Participate An infusion of hip night life wakes up a humdrum city. Frankfurt, long considered strictly a financial capital and major travel hub, used to land on the culturati map once a year, during its annual book fair. A recent boom of restaurants and clubs, though, makes the case for permanent placement. Leading the city’s transformation is its fast-evolving red light district, where spots like Maxie Eisen, a deli-style cafe by day and a speakeasy-inspired bar by night, offer a sexiness that isn’t unseemly. In the city center, a buzzy pan-Asian restaurant called Moriki was just opened by the Berlin-based chef Duc Ngo with a menu that includes envelope-pushing courses like sushi pizza; and the new sleek Lamoraga, a modern Spanish restaurant, is pulling in the shopping crowds for lunch. By the end of next year, the developer Ardi Goldman plans to reinvent and reopen the famed King Kamehameha Club, which had its original heyday in the 1990s and 2000s. And growth extends to the art world: The 32,000-square-foot underground extension at the Städel Museum earned accolades from around the globe when it opened last year. Facebook Participate An ambitious art scene heads toward the international stage. Building on a strong historical legacy (Addis boasts one of East Africa’s oldest art schools) are a host of events scheduled for 2014: a photography festival, two film festivals and a jazz and world music festival. Thanks to the city’s diverse art institutions and galleries, including the artist-in-residence village Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the Asni Gallery (really more an art collective than a gallery), there is an art opening at least once a week. Even the local Sheraton puts on “Art of Ethiopia,” an annual show of new talent. But it’s the National Museum that, in May and June, hosted this year’s blockbuster exhibit, “Ras Tafari: The Majesty and the Movement,” devoted to Emperor Haile Selassie I and Rastafarianism. Facebook Participate A world-class World Cup getaway. Now that the World Cup is over, escape to Fernando de Noronha, a 21-island archipelago about 330 miles off the coast of one of the host cities, Recife. Here you’ll find 250-foot-high black cliffs muscling against peach-sand beaches, Portuguese hilltop forts and blue coves where humpbacks and spinner dolphins linger. Only one of the islands, Noronha, is inhabited, and the entire chain is protected as a park with just 246 visitors allowed per day. Regulations have kept Noronha relaxed, with only small hotels and roads rough enough to make dune buggies the rental cars of choice. Hike along cliffs to gorgeous beaches like Sancho, dive with sea turtles or climb Morro do Pico, a 1,059-foot-high volcanic pinnacle. Facebook Participate Leather jackets and skinny jeans join cowboy boots. Country music lovers have long made the pilgrimage to Nashville, but now the city has fast gained cachet among rock fans and foodies. The city’s vibrant scene is home to the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Jeff the Brotherhood and Diarrhea Planet, who all play in town occasionally. And a youthquake is transforming scruffy neighborhoods like 12South and East Nashville into hipster hubs. New hangouts include Pinewood Social, a bar, restaurant, bowling alley and karaoke joint, and the 404, a restaurant and boutique hotel in a former auto garage. Add to that a thriving culinary scene, exemplified by the Music City Eats Festival, back for a second year in September. And Nashville’s old standbys — like the honky-tonk Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and the venerable Ryman — are as fun as ever. Facebook Participate New reasons to play, and watch players, in Scotland’s yards. Riddled with lochs and crested by moody Highlands, Scotland adds to its already considerable outdoorsy appeal this year. In April, the John Muir Way, named for the conservationist originally from Scotland, expanded to 134 miles from 45 miles, newly spanning the farmland and forests of the country’s midsection. Organizers estimate it will take eight to 12 days on foot or four to six by bike to complete the coast-to-coast route running from Muir’s boyhood hometown Dunbar west to the Loch Lomond area. The attractions extend beyond amateur workouts. This summer, Glasgow staged the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Olympic-style competitions for Britain and the former British colonies, and in September Gleneagles resort in the Highlands will host the Ryder Cup golf competition. Sports and hospitality meet at Cromlix House Hotel, a 15-room resort that the tennis champion and local hero Andy Murray opened earlier this year in a Victorian mansion in Dunblane. Facebook Participate An oil boom town gets its cultural legs. Flush with oil money, Calgary has morphed from ho-hum city on the prairie into a cultural hub, with offerings far beyond the Stampede, the annual rodeo and festival. Locals stroll over the tubular Peace Bridge, designed by Santiago Calatrava, opened in 2012. Public art is part of life; in 2013 Jaume Plensa completed Wonderland, a 39-foot-tall steel mesh head installed in front of the new skyline-transforming Norman Foster-designed Bow Tower. They join beloved cultural institutions like the One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theater, whose dancer and choreographer Denise Clarke was in December named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors. Facebook Participate Sand and surf, now a (low-cost) hop from Osaka. The yen is the weakest it’s been against the dollar in years, putting Japan more within reach in 2014. For low prices coupled with laid-back attitudes, look way south to the island of Ishigaki, 250 miles south of Okinawa Island and far from the bustle of Tokyo. The 85-square-mile island, largely undiscovered, is home to sunburned surfers, sandy beaches and beautiful coral reefs. And it’s never been easier to reach: A new airport opened here in March 2013, and Japan’s new low-cost carrier, Peach, just began service from Osaka. Facebook Participate A pristine slice of biodiversity is home to a new luxury eco-resort. Set between Mount Kenya and the Great Rift Valley, the Laikipia Plateau teems with wildlife: elephants, leopards, endangered rhinos and one of the highest concentrations of zebras on the continent. Now the area has also become a conservation success story, sustained and protected through an unusual mix of public and private partnerships and a network of environmentally minded ranchers. With the 2013 opening of Segera, a resort owned by Jochen Zeitz, a German-born executive, there is also a new spot to admire its pristine landscapes. The 50,000-acre property includes an enviable collection of contemporary African art, an organic and solar-powered farm and a wine collection focusing on African labels. And more sustainable travel may be on the horizon: A new national park on the area’s southwestern border has been proposed by the government. Facebook Participate A volcano, a temple, a shrine and now a place to stay. This central Javan sultanate draws crowds for its proximity to bewitching attractions: the monumental, wedding cake-esque Buddhist temple Borobudur, the soft-serve-ice-cream-shaped Hindu shrines of Prambanan, and pre-sunrise hikes to summit Indonesia’s friskiest volcano, Mount Merapi (which most recently erupted in 2013). But finding a decent room has never been easy, until now. Thanks to tax breaks for hotel development, 20 new starred hotels, to complement the city’s existing 30, will open through 2015. Among them are Zest Hotel (a Swiss-Belhotel brand) at the end of 2014 and, according to a director of the Tourism Promotion Agency of Yogyakarta, three new properties from Accor, whose brands include Sofitel and ibis. Facebook Participate A ski area spruces up with new terrain, lodging and an entire base village. For decades Northstar-at-Tahoe, on the north end of Lake Tahoe, was a mostly overlooked ski hill. Since 2004, however, more than $1 billion has poured into the resort. Though weather in the region has been fickle so far this season, the improvements are impressive. And they aren’t limited to the base village that has risen at the renamed Northstar, centered around a huge ice rink ringed by couches and fire pits. The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe opened a few years ago, and Vail Resorts, since buying the ski resort in late 2010, has built an on-mountain day lodge, added more terrain and installed the new Promised Land Express lift on the resort’s Backside. Tahoe is resurgent, as resorts from Squaw Valley to Homewood undertake improvements with an eye toward bidding for the 2026 Winter Olympics. In the next few years expect to see everything from the Cal Neva Resort, once owned by Frank Sinatra, open after a big renovation, to a South Lake Tahoe with new waterfront hotels. Facebook Participate A photogenic (and historic) ale trail. The sprawling northern county of Yorkshire is becoming a big destination for beer lovers, thanks to a recently published guidebook called “Great Yorkshire Beer” and a renewed interest in historic breweries like Samuel Smith (founded in 1758) and Timothy Taylor (from 1858). Spend an evening crawling through the Fat Cat, the Kelham Island Tavern and other award-winning pubs in Sheffield — recently called Britain’s best beer city by the connoisseur Adrian Tierney-Jones — then travel to Leeds, whose compact center is home to the Victoria Hotel, the Cross Keys and other public houses that pull pints on traditional hand pumps. A final stay in the photogenic city of York offers a Tudor-style pub at the end of every cobbled lane, as well as modern beer temples like York Tap, Pivni and the House of Trembling Madness. Facebook Participate Reborn, relentless and still over the top. Five years ago, one of the planet’s most ambitious cities appeared to be dying. Crushed with debt, Dubai found its megaprojects and skyscrapers scuttled or scrapped. The city went from juggernaut to joke. But now, it’s back. Economically surging, Dubai has won its bid to host World Expo 2020 and has unveiled its Tourism Vision, also for 2020, a plan to attract 20 million tourists — double the current crowd. Last October witnessed the first passenger terminal at Dubai World Central Al Maktoum International Airport, and travelers will discover colossal new hotels like the 555-room Conrad Dubai and the 77-story JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, which Guinness World Records recognizes as the tallest hotel in the world. This year, a new tram system will be inaugurated, along with some theme parks, including the first phase of Dubai Adventure Studios, the first phase of IMG Worlds of Adventure, and Holy Quran Park (devoted to the Islamic holy book). Facebook Participate New saints, a new(ish) pope and newly restored treasures beckon. Pope Francis, who has nearly 4.8 million followers on Twitter and routinely makes headlines for doing things like inviting atheists to join the cause for peace in his Christmas message, is widely viewed as reinvigorating the scandal-plagued, conservative-leaning Roman Catholic Church. (Just ask Time magazine, which last December named him the 2013 Person of the Year.) The first South American pope is so popular that the Vatican estimated that nearly a million visitors came in April for Holy Week and the canonization of John XXIII and John Paul II. Services commemorating the new saints will continue throughout the year. The faithful can also enjoy the fruits of restorations that have taken years, like that of Bernini’s colonnade in St. Peter’s Square and the reopening of the Via Triumphalis necropolis, a vast ancient Roman cemetery first uncovered in the 1950s. And pilgrims can stay up-to-date on news and events, including restorations and exhibitions, thanks to the Pope’s new mobile app. Facebook Participate South American beach towns, before they go upscale. Around glamorous Punta del Este and boho-chic José Ignacio, there’s no deficiency of boutique hotels, expat art galleries and exclusive waterfront brasseries. But farther east along the Uruguayan Riviera, a relatively untrodden stretch of Atlantic coast tucked between Argentina and Brazil, sun, sand and simplicity remain the draw — for now. In the Rocha region, villages like Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, San Antonio and Punta del Diablo are just starting to attract serious international attention, bringing a sprinkling of first-rate accommodation — like Brisas, a clifftop 14-room inn restored by an Argentine tech mogul — without compromising the area’s natural charms: miles of undeveloped beach, rolling pastures and a culture where gaucho cowboys and fishermen with wooden boats aren’t just props. Facebook Participate A cultural capital springs to life. Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu (and formerly known as Madras), was long considered the gateway to popular South Indian tourist destinations like Kerala but was overlooked as an attraction itself. It is, however, a national cultural capital and home to several dance and music schools like Kalakshetra for dance and the Music Academy for Carnatic South Indian music, which both regularly hold performances around town. There are also historic sites aplenty, including the Kapaleeswarar Temple, built in the name of the Hindu god Shiva. Fresh buzz makes this city especially enticing: Several major hotels including the Park Hyatt have recently opened, and there is a slew of new and trendy clubs, boutiques and restaurants, including Ottimo for excellent pizzas. Facebook Participate An African luxury hot spot that’s become easier to get to. This archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean now has one of the world’s most expensive hotels. The listed price for a villa at the North Island resort, on a private island where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed during their honeymoon, ranges from 2,582 to 4,079 euros (about $3,670 to $5,800) per night; the Doubletree by Hilton Seychelles, which opened last year is, thankfully, more affordable. The appeal goes beyond pampering and powdery beaches: The Seychelles is also home to some 100,000 giant Aldabra tortoises that live on a coral atoll that is a Unesco World Heritage site. Air Seychelles recently signed code-share agreements with Air Berlin, Cathay Pacific Airways and other airlines, making these islands about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Africa more accessible. Facebook Participate A Phuket-like hideaway, but still unspoiled. The southern Thailand town of Krabi lies just a 45-minute boat ride across the Andaman Sea from Phuket. But you can spare yourself the trip to Phuket — plenty of riches lie here, and you don’t have to fight the crowds to enjoy them. Krabi sits next to the Mu Koh Lanta National Park, a prime spot for hiking, rock climbing and elephant trekking. If you do get restless, there are about 130 pristine islands nearby that are ripe for exploration and virtually undeveloped save for a few ancient monasteries. And Krabi, which used to have few options for accommodations and was hard to get to, is now more tourist-friendly. A number of hotels have opened in recent years, including Phulay Bay, a Ritz-Carlton property. A marina, Port Takola, is in the works and will be home to restaurants, night life and shopping, and a new terminal that has opened at Krabi Airport means that there are more flights to and from this gem. Facebook Participate Ditch those poles. Art and bike trails await. This ski town has a big development off-piste: The long-awaited reinvented Aspen Art Museum opened its doors this summer. The 33,000-square-foot space, designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, is meant to reflect the mountain experience. Visitors first take a lift to the roof and take in the view from the sculpture garden before descending to tour the galleries. There is also plenty of news for outdoor types this year, too, with new mountain biking trails planned throughout Aspen and Snowmass, a new mountain skills center and expanded lift-serviced biking. Facebook Participate Natural wonders are in danger. Go see them before it’s too late. The Icelandic government has spent decades protecting its glaciers, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and permafrost mounds in the Thjorsarver Wetlands, part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of the entire country, mostly in the interior. But last year, the government announced plans to revoke those protections, allowing for the construction of hydropower plants (instead of glaciers and free-flowing rivers, imagine man-made reservoirs, dams, paved roads and power lines). “If they get into this area, there will be no way to stop them from destroying the wetlands completely,” said Arni Finnsson, the chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. If you ever want to see Iceland in all of its famously raw natural beauty, go now. Facebook Participate Soundscapes and culture shine in northern Sweden. A hotbed of hardcore and heavy metal music through the 1990s, this northern city has welcomed all genres during its tenure as a European Capital of Culture this year. Music has taken center stage at outdoor opera performances, a crowdsourced music festival and an orchestral tribute to the local hardcore band Refused. Visual arts focused on the culture of indigenous Sami people are on exhibit at Bildmuseet, the city’s contemporary arts museum that reopened in 2012 in a glass-and-wood building designed by Henning Larsen Architects. And it’s all easier to reach thanks to a new higher-speed rail connection from Stockholm. Facebook Participate Skip smog-choked cities — and face masks — and head out to China’s wild frontier. With pollution skyrocketing in China’s showcase cities, visitors to the country are increasingly seeking out greener pastures to explore. Set deep in the tropics of southern Yunnan province, Xishuangbanna is about as lush as you can get — the region boasts the richest biodiversity in China, including some of the country’s last wild elephants. In February 2013, the area went upscale with its first five-star hotel — the Anantara Xishuangbanna Resort & Spa, which organizes tea-leaf picking trips in mountainside plantations. More action-oriented experiences are possible, as well, such as the tour group WildChina’s jungle biking trips or treks along the caravan route plied by tea traders centuries ago. Facebook Participate A mountain makeover from overlooked to opulent. Andermatt has long been a quiet town of Alpine farmers and bargain-seeking skiers. But the former Swiss Army outpost began its transformation into a bona fide ski destination with the opening last December of the Chedi Andermatt. The 104-room resort, housed in a modernized chalet with a Japanese restaurant among several dining options, indoor and outdoor pools and a 10-treatment-room spa, is just the first phase of a big new development of apartment buildings, homes, five more hotels and a golf course in the coming years over 321 acres. The pedestrian village will offer skiers access by gondola to the nearly 9,800-foot Gemsstock Mountain, with future lifts to the larger nearby ski area of Sedrun planned to open in 2015. Facebook Participate In the land of cars, cycling (and culture) get the limelight. An urban cycling model has arrived in Indianapolis: the new $63 million, eight-mile bike-friendly Indy Cultural Trail. The path connects five downtown neighborhoods, including arty Fountain Square, to top downtown sites, including the Capitol Building, City Market and White River State Park, a 250-acre park that hosts the Indianapolis Zoo and six more major attractions. Bicycles can be rented along the paved and lighted pathway, allowing riders to cruise past public art, including a motion-activated fireflylike swarm of LED lights. City officials say that planners from Cologne, Germany, to Portland, Ore., have come to see how the city most famous for a 500-mile car race managed to swap auto for bike lanes and still keep everything rolling smoothly. Facebook Participate River cruising swells on the Danube of Asia. Like the Danube in Europe, the Mekong River in Southeast Asia has become a vital river cruising course, with a variety of small-ship itineraries linking Vietnam and Cambodia. Late last year, Pandaw River Expeditions upgraded two of its ships, the Mekong Pandaw and Tonle Pandaw, enlarging public spaces, adding gyms and stocking cabins with iPads. In 2012, the company launched the 32-guest Angkor Pandaw, offering three- to seven-night itineraries, while Avalon Waterways set the 32-passenger Avalon Angkor sailing between Ho Chi Minh City and Siem Reap over seven nights. In September, Aqua Expeditions will introduce the 20-suite Aqua Mekong, offering guide-led shore excursions to temples, villages and wildlife-rich areas via skiffs. Facebook Participate Out of an economic crisis, a city surges back. Vibrancy and innovation can bloom even in hard times. Exhibit A is Greece’s ancient capital, which was hit hard by the global economic crisis and yet is seeing change at sites old and new. First the old: At the Acropolis, the famous Caryatids statues continue to get a restoration in 2014. And the new: The National Museum of Contemporary Art will soon open in a former brewery complex. Neighborhoods have also seen a resurgence, including the quickly gentrifying Monastiraki and the still gritty Kerameikos-Metaxourgeio; the latter will get a cultural lift in 2015 from the biannual ReMap art event. Travelers will have a new lodging option by the end of the year, when a revived Emporikon Hotel opens on Aiolou, a street that is also home to a host of new dining spots. Facebook Participate A scenic, low-key destination on the verge of discovery. Most vacationers to La Republica hole up in the all-inclusives north and east, overlooking the rarely traveled southwest. The port town of Barahona is the gateway to the cactus-strewn region’s riches, like the hauntingly beautiful Bahia de las Aguilas beach and the eight climate zones at the geological depression Hoyo de Pelempito, both blissfully devoid of people. But there are signs of the government’s vision to develop the area. The abandoned former Barcelo Bahoruco Beach Resort will partly open at the end of 2014, and two separate 300-room projects — near La Canoa and San Rafael Beach — are in the final stages of design approval. For now, you can experience the quiet life at the thatch-roofed Casa Bonita, or at Rancho Platon, which has a tree house raised between the palms. Facebook Participate Chasing the northern lights? This might be the year. There aren't many reasons to visit the frigid region surrounding the North Pole, but the darkest months, from September through March, offer the most stunning of them: northern lights, that colorful spectacle of solar particles entering our atmosphere. And there are some comfortable ways to see them, thanks to hotels offering northern lights safaris, including the newly opened Ion Luxury Adventure Hotel in Iceland and the Icehotel in Swedish Lapland (and actually within the Arctic Circle). Facebook Participate On the African coast, music thrives in a commercial capital. Tanzania may be best known for the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro and the game-packed plains of the Serengeti, but the real pulse of the country is found in its largest city, Dar es Salaam. An eclectic mix of music echoes through the beach clubs, open-air bars and nightclubs of this Indian Ocean coastal city. Old-school dance music competes with Swahili hip-hop and traditional drumming, all drawing from the city’s African, Indian and Arab influences. Add in the street food, the beaches and the fact that the year-old African low-cost carrier Fastjet uses Dar as its hub, and it’s easy to see that this commercial capital is more than a stopover on the way to Tanzania’s natural splendor. It is an African metropolis coming into its own. Facebook Participate A revitalized city center welcomes new museums and streetcars. Atlanta plans several ribbon cuttings in 2014, but the main event is the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, opened in June next to the Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia Aquarium downtown. The 42,000-square-foot, environmentally friendly museum features permanent galleries devoted to domestic and international rights struggles and houses the Martin Luther King Jr. papers owned by Morehouse College. By November, visitors will be able to take the new Atlanta Streetcar on a 2.7-mile loop that will link the park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and other stops. Another parkside attraction, the 94,000-square-foot College Football Hall of Fame, is opening in time for fall kickoff of the N.C.A.A. season. Facebook Participate Skiing, soba and snow monkeys. For nearly a century, visitors have been lured to this ski destination, a 90-minute drive from Nagano, by affordability and a host of charms: fine powder, long slopes and charming cobblestone lanes lined with traditional ryokan inns, generations-old soba noodle shops and natural hot spring baths. But the recent arrival of stylish, foreigner-friendly restaurants, cafes and bars have infused the area with new energy, offering travelers just the right mix of old and new. Microbrews and excellent coffee are served at ski-in/ski-out Craft Room, while Tamon prepares innovative kaiseki cuisine using local ingredients. The lantern-hung rooms at Jon Nobi are popular among international skiers, as is its chic izakaya restaurant Himatsuri, inspired by the town’s fire festival, held annually on Jan. 15. The Asian operator Backyard Travel offers 10-day itineraries to explore Nozawa and nearby sights like a seventh-century temple and a refuge for the area’s famed snow monkeys. Facebook Participate Serbian wine? Time to take a sip. The Balkan Peninsula has a wine culture that dates back hundreds of years, but war and political unrest over the last century decimated Serbian vineyards. As recently as a decade ago, Serbia produced virtually no wine that met international standards. But progress has been swift. Recently, small producers have revived the Subotica-Horgos wine region near the northern border with Hungary. Here, the Palic Wine Route has been attracting domestic wine tourists who spend days sampling local cabernet sauvignon in wine cellars, sipping dry Trijumf white during dinner at Bosscaffe and unwinding in the Hotel Galleria‘s high-tech spa. Facebook Participate A museum’s entrance makes for something new in the state of Denmark. Even angst-ridden Prince Hamlet, literature’s most famous Dane, might be cheered by the new Maritime Museum of Denmark, which recently opened in his hometown Elsinore. Designed by the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, the glassy structure is built into a U-shaped dry dock and filled with slanted floors and zigzag passageways that evoke ocean-rocked ships’ decks. Maritime relics — from torpedoes to Lego pirate ships — mix with electronic maps and films that explore the romance of the sea, shipboard existence and trade, both centuries ago and today. Interactive exhibits allow you to run your own trade company, navigate by the stars and ink a sailor’s tattoo. For additional watery wonders, head to Copenhagen’s new Blue Planet aquarium, billed as the largest in Northern Europe. Facebook Participate Haute cuisine comes to the lush landscapes of the Lake District. The British dining scene is expanding beyond London, and the chef Simon Rogan deserves much of the credit, having helped elevate the Lake District village of Cartmel into one of England’s most unlikely culinary destinations. His three restaurants in the medieval village — the Michelin two-starred L’Enclume, Rogan & Company and his most recent addition, the Pig & Whistle — have menus featuring whatever’s fresh on his nearby farm. Cartmel is also home to a celebrated farmers’ market, Cartmel Cheeses and the Cartmel Village shop, renowned for its sticky toffee pudding. What’s more, the village is a cozy base from which to explore the Lake District, once an inspiration to William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter. Facebook Participate New peaks open up for alpine adventurers. This Himalayan republic is the mother lode of alpinism, home to eight of the world’s 10 highest summits (including Everest). So when a Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation subcommittee recommended last September that Nepal allow access to 165 new peaks in the Kanchenjunga massif this year — 13 of them above 23,000 feet — the world’s mountaineering community was aflutter. Some welcomed the announcement, while others dismissed it, saying the government had stretched the meaning of “peak” in a few cases to include subpeaks within mountains that were already accessible in order to rake in more in fees. Even so, the proposal was significant since it was the first such release in a decade. And though the government scaled back the scope of the original proposal, it did formally open 104 of the new peaks in May. Facebook Participate Feel like reminiscing? A city is awash in anniversaries. Vienna is home to some 450 balls each year, from traditional waltzes to the “seriously outlandish” Rosenball for the gay community, and this year is the 200th anniversary since the city’s ball culture took root. You could mark the occasion by attending one, but it wouldn’t be the only date to celebrate in the capital city this year. Visitors can pay homage at the Sigmund Freud Museum since it has been 75 years since the psychoanalyst’s death. The city is also commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War I with special exhibits and the European Peace Walk, a permanent route from Vienna to Trieste through five countries. There are also new art spaces, a new transportation hub, more direct flights from the United States and offbeat places to stay, like Urbanauts’ former storefronts or Chez Cliché’s themed apartments, with décor inspired by fictional hosts, such as Marie Therese, who loves Baroque furnishings and classical music. Facebook Participate Even a 1,200-year-old lost city has some new draws. If you’ve seen the temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, then the country’s lost city of Mahendraparvata, its majestic temples on Phnom Kulen and the stone animal carvings at the site of Srah Damrei (elephant pond) should be next on your list. About 30 miles from Siem Reap, Mahendraparvata predates Angkor Wat by about 350 years and was the birthplace of the Khmer Empire in A.D. 802. Although the city has been known about for several decades, researchers in 2013 discovered new temples and a network of roads and dikes that had been concealed under thick mountain vegetation. Facebook Participate Croatia’s architectural and musical gem lies inland. Forget Croatia’s beloved coast: The inland city Varazdin is one of the country’s most picturesque and well-preserved areas. One hour north of Zagreb, this small metropolis of 50,000 has an immaculate cobblestoned town center and is stocked with Baroque churches and palaces like the Draskovic. The theme continues with an annual Baroque music festival, but that’s where it ends. Other music-themed festivals and concerts are decidedly modern and change from year to year: One, the Radar Festival, for contemporary stars, has drawn names such as Bob Dylan and Carlos Santana, and various other festivals throughout the year such as Spancir Fest, celebrated from the end of August to September, attract artists and musicians from around Europe. Facebook Participate Reinventing a Florida city’s reputation. Once mocked for its thousands of green benches dotted with senior citizens, St. Petersburg is anything but stationary. With a redeveloped waterfront, a stunning Dali Museum, and sophisticated restaurants in place, the downtown energy is now heading up historic Central Avenue, thanks in part to the craft beer scene. Among the many recent arrivals, artsy Cycle Brewing features Fixie and Endo ales, while Green Bench Brewing Co., the name a nod to those erstwhile icons, invites winter escapees to its sunny taproom and beer garden. Refuel at the ambitious Rococo Steak, set in a renovated 1920s YWCA, then hit the Tap Room of the reinvented Hollander Hotel. Facebook Participate More flights and lodges in Central America’s eco-frontier. Twenty years ago, when Francis Ford Coppola opened Blancaneaux Lodge in western Belize, relatively few travelers had ventured into this small Central American country. Slowly they arrived, many of them curious to witness the scenery that had captivated the film director, which he described in an email as “completely remote, with a beautiful pristine river you could drink the water out of and the most star-studded night sky I had ever seen.” Since then, upscale rustic hotels have cropped up all over Belize — there’s El Secreto in Ambergris Caye, for example, and Belcampo, an eco-lodge and sustainable farm in the south that’s about to unveil a sophisticated redesign — adding to the lure of rain forests, Mayan ruins and coral reefs. It helps that Belize is easier to reach: Delta recently began nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Belize City, and regional carriers like Tropic Air have expanded their routes, connecting Belize to resorts like Cancún and making remote towns like San Ignacio more accessible. Facebook Participate What you’d expect (natural beauty) and not (world-class museum). This semisecret gem of the South Pacific, a three-hour flight from Sydney, is attracting visitors like never before. Thank infrastructural upgrades like a refurbished international airport, improved roads and bridges, and the arrival of high-profile properties like the new Hilton Noumea La Promenade Residences and the Sheraton New Caledonia Deva Resort & Spa. An island itinerary reads like a fantasy novel: snorkeling and diving in one of the world’s largest lagoons, an aquamarine stunner populated by thousands of coral and marine species and home to the world’s second largest reef (after the Great Barrier); horseback riding through verdant mountains and indigenous Kanak villages; kayaking by moonlight among the submerged forest of the Blue River Provincial Park. The cosmopolitan capital, Nouméa, has its own allures, like Le Roof, where you might spot dolphins diving in the distance while savoring the fresh oysters, and the Tjibaou Cultural Center, a Renzo Piano-designed museum housing one of the world’s largest collections of Pacific art. Facebook Participate Once a kitsch capital, now earning a reputation for food and sports. Known for its remarkable natural beauty and tourist kitsch, Niagara Falls is now evolving into a draw for those who love food as well as those who seek thrills. The Niagara Falls Culinary Institute opened a high-end restaurant, deli, patisserie and gelateria steps from the American Falls, transforming the area’s dining scene overnight. A gastro pub called the Griffon Pub, which features 50 beers on tap and creative New American dishes like gnocchi poutine, opened a few miles east of the falls last year. On the Canadian side, oenophiles can get a taste of the region’s growing wine scene just a short bike ride from the falls along the Niagara River Recreation Trail. Nondining attractions are plentiful, too. This year, Canadians have hosted two major War of 1812 bicentennial re-enactments in the area, and since May visitors have been able to see the falls from a new luxury catamaran. Tourism officials on the Canadian side appear poised to allow daredevils to zip line across or rappel down the Niagara Gorge later this year.

The Thjorsarver Wetlands in Iceland are part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of Iceland. The wetlands themselves do not constitute 40 percent of the country. Two of the airlines scheduled to provide budget service to Taiwan are China Airlines, not China Airways, and TransAsia Airways, not TransAsia Air.

Business   Appeals Court Upholds BP Oil Spill Settlement. Advertisement Advertisement By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSJAN. 10, 2014 NEW ORLEANS — Over BP’s objections, a federal appeals court on Friday upheld a judge’s approval of the company’s multibillion-dollar settlement with lawyers for businesses and residents who claim the immense 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico cost them money. BP has argued that Judge Carl Barbier of Federal District Court and the court-appointed claims administrator, Patrick Juneau, have misinterpreted settlement terms in ways that would force the oil giant, based in London, to pay for billions of dollars in inflated or false claims by businesses. During a hearing in November before a three-judge panel of the Fifth Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, a BP lawyer argued that Judge Barbier’s 2012 approval of the deal should not stand unless the company ultimately prevails in its continuing dispute over business payments. But the divided panel ruled on Friday that Judge Barbier did not err by failing to determine more than a year ago whether the class of eligible claimants included individuals who have not actually suffered any injury related to the spill. Affirming Judge Barbier’s 2012 ruling, the court said in its 48-page majority opinion that it could not agree with arguments raised by BP and others who separately objected to the settlement. Advertisement “No case cited by BP or the objectors suggests that a district court must also safeguard the interests of the defendant, which in most settlements can protect its own interests at the negotiating table,” the ruling says. BP did not immediately comment on the decision on Friday. One of the three appellate judges, Emilio M. Garza, disagreed with the majority in a 14-page dissent, saying the “attempted global settlement fails in a narrow, but significant, regard” and should be vacated so it can be fixed. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have argued that BP simply undervalued the settlement and underestimated how many claimants would be eligible for payments. “Today’s ruling is an enormous victory for the Gulf, and an important step forward in ensuring that every eligible claimant is fully compensated according to the objective, transparent formulas detailed in the settlement agreement that BP co-authored and agreed to,” said lawyers for plaintiffs, Steve Herman and Jim Roy, who negotiated the settlement and urged the Fifth Circuit to uphold it.

Foreign   New Clashes Erupt in Ukraine After Trial. Advertisement Advertisement By DAVID M. HERSZENHORNJAN. 10, 2014 At least a dozen protesters were injured in clashes with riot police in Kiev after a Ukrainian court on Friday convicted three men of plotting to topple a statue of Vladimir Lenin in 2011 in Boryspil, a city southeast of the capital. The protesters had denounced the prosecution of the three men as politically motivated and a “show trial” and pointed to evidence showing that the Boryspil City Council had voted to remove the Lenin statue even before the alleged plot was discovered. About 100 protesters had gathered at the courthouse in Kiev for the verdict. The clashes began after the three defendants were sentenced to six years in prison. Among the injured was Yuri V. Lutsenko, a former interior minister and an outspoken opposition leader who helped coordinate the recent mass demonstrations in central Kiev against the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich. Local news agencies reported that Mr. Lutsenko had been knocked unconscious. Mr. Lutsenko, who was also an organizer of the 2004 Orange Revolution, is the leader of an opposition party called the Third Ukrainian Republic.

Business   For Financier, a Final Try to Avoid U.S. Charges. Advertisement Advertisement By JACK EWINGJAN. 12, 2014 A lawyer for Florian Homm, a German financier wanted by United States authorities, says he will appeal to the Italian Ministry of Justice in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the former hedge fund manager from being extradited to Los Angeles to face charges of securities fraud. On Friday, Italy’s highest court cleared the way for Mr. Homm, 54, to be sent to Los Angeles for trial on federal charges that he defrauded investors of at least $200 million. The most serious of the four felony counts carry maximum sentences of 25 years in prison. The last hope for Mr. Homm, who was arrested on United States charges in Italy last year after five years in hiding, is that the Italian Ministry of Justice will block the extradition, but that is considered unlikely. Mr. Homm’s lawyers argued that he has multiple sclerosis and is not healthy enough to withstand the stress of extradition and trial. Mr. Homm “firmly believes he will be exonerated, but we are gravely concerned about his ability to survive this ordeal,” Jan Lawrence Handzlik, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Mr. Homm, said on Saturday in an emailed statement. The Italian court also rejected a plea by Mr. Homm to be transferred to a civilian hospital. Mr. Homm, who holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from Harvard, has been held in jails in Florence and Pisa since his arrest in March at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, where he planned to rendezvous with family members. Mr. Homm does not face any charges in Germany and would have been safe from extradition if he had remained there. Advertisement While denying he has committed any crimes, Mr. Homm often seems to revel in his own notoriety. While in hiding, he published a book, “Rogue Financier: The Adventures of an Estranged Capitalist,” in which he recalled, with some regret, his exploits as a predatory investor who shook up the staid world of German industry in the 1990s. Mr. Homm later became part owner of Borussia Dortmund, one of the country’s top soccer teams. Mr. Homm cultivated a flamboyant public persona in Germany, appearing on talk shows chomping his trademark Cuban cigar, before he abruptly dropped from view in 2007 amid the collapse of the portfolio of hedge funds he founded, Absolute Capital Management Holdings. After years spent mostly in Colombia, according to Mr. Homm’s account, he reappeared last year, promoting his book in a series of clandestine interviews. Since 2011, Mr. Homm has been the target of a civil suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused him of manipulating stock prices by buying and selling thinly traded shares between entities he controlled. The criminal charges, filed shortly before Mr. Homm’s arrest last year, are based on the same circumstances. The companies whose shares were traded were based in the United States. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Homm earned commissions as a result of trades between the hedge fund and a Los Angeles broker in which he owned a stake. The trades inflated the prices of penny stocks and made Absolute Capital Management look more valuable than it was, the F.B.I. said in a statement. Mr. Homm and people he worked with are accused of earning $53 million through the scheme. Mr. Homm faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud. The German magazine Stern reported that an Italian doctor, Giuseppe Meco, described as a leading neurologist, testified before the Italian high court in December that, while Mr. Homm is suffering from multiple sclerosis, he is fit enough to withstand incarceration. Mr. Handzlik, Mr. Homm’s lawyer, disagreed, saying in a telephone interview that Mr. Homm would effectively be exposed to life imprisonment in the United States, a much harsher penalty than would be likely on similar charges in Italy. Mr. Handzlik said that Mr. Homm’s lawyers in Italy would also cite humanitarian grounds in arguing for leniency.

Foreign   Show Banned, French Comedian Has New One. Advertisement Advertisement By REUTERSJAN. 12, 2014 PARIS — A French comedian said Saturday that he had dropped a show banned for its anti-Semitic language and was planning one that would cause no objections. On Friday, France’s highest administrative court upheld a ban on a show by the comedian, Dieudonné M’Bala M’Bala, in the central city of Tours, days after it was also banned in the western city of Nantes. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala said in a statement that his lawyers would continue to defend the banned show in court, and that his new show, about Africa, would have none of the language that the courts found objectionable. “We live in a democratic country and I have to comply with the laws, despite the blatant political interference,” he said. “As a comedian, I have pushed the debate to the very edge of laughter.” Mr. M’Bala M’Bala, 46, has been repeatedly fined for hate speech, and the local authorities in several towns have banned his shows as a threat to public order. Advertisement Interior Minister Manuel Valls has urged local authorities to take a hard line in determining whether to ban the show. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala had been scheduled to perform in the city of Orleans on Saturday, but the show was canceled by a local court after a request by the mayor. Jacques Verdier, one of Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s lawyers, told the television channel iTele that the new show would not run afoul of the courts. “Let him work now,” he said. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s lawyers have repeatedly said the bans infringed his right to freedom of speech. Critics say the comedian’s trademark downward straight-arm gesture is a Nazi salute in reverse. Mr. M’Bala M’Bala counters that it is meant to be anti-Zionist and anti-establishment, but not anti-Semitic. “I am not a Nazi, I am not anti-Semitic,” he said Saturday. Originally active with left-wing, antiracist groups, Mr. M’Bala M’Bala began openly criticizing Jews and Israel in 2002 and ran in European elections two years later for a pro-Palestinian party. The founder of the French far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has said he is the godfather of one of Mr. M’Bala M’Bala’s children, but his daughter Marine Le Pen, who now runs the party, has kept her distance from the comedian. Elie Semoun, a Jewish comedian with whom Mr. M’Bala M’Bala formed a popular comic duo in the mid-1990s, said he did not understand the turn his old friend had taken. “We worked together for 15 years,” Mr. Semoun said in a short act on French television on Saturday. “How did you support me for so long?” Advertisement “When Dieudo and I started out together, we were the very symbol of antiracism, to the point that I forgot that I was black and he was Jewish,” Mr. Semoun said. “Too bad, I loved being black.” A version of this article appears in print on January 12, 2014, on page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Show Banned, French Comedian Has New One.

Travel   52 Places to Go in 2014. Advertisement Advertisement Witness a city in transformation, glimpse exotic animals, explore the past and enjoy that beach before the crowds. UPDATED September 5, 2014 A place to meditate on freedom, and the creative life that followed. When Nelson Mandela was incarcerated at Robben Island prison, he found inspiration in Cape Town. “We often looked across Table Bay at the magnificent silhouette of Table Mountain,” he said in a speech. “To us on Robben Island, Table Mountain was a beacon of hope. It represented the mainland to which we knew we would one day return.” Cape Town’s importance to Mandela, who made his first address there as a free man, will doubtless draw many visitors in the wake of his death. The country has transformed itself since Mandela’s imprisonment, but there’s still much to be done. Many in Cape Town have been grappling with that challenge, including its creative class, which has been examining whether inspired design can solve some of the issues stemming from years of inequality. The city formally takes up that issue this year during its turn as World Design Capital. Cape Town is celebrating design in all its forms, putting on fashion shows by students and established designers alike, hosting architecture open houses, welcoming the public into artists’ studios and folding the annual visual arts spectacular Design Indaba conference, which took place in February, into the design capital program. Also part of the lineup are locals seeking to rejuvenate impoverished black-majority townships: The Maboneng Lalela Project turns township homes into galleries and performance spaces; Foodpods constructs sustainable farms, giving residents access to healthy produce; and the Langa Quarter project seeks to make the precinct a cultural tourism destination. Cape Town is again reinventing itself, and the world is invited to its renaissance. Facebook Participate The rebirth of a quake-ravaged city. Three years after two large earthquakes devastated central Christchurch, the city is experiencing a rebirth with creativity and wit — thanks to the ingenuity of its hardy residents — and is welcoming tourists back again. Though much of the central city has yet to be rebuilt, entrepreneurs and volunteers are finding surprising ways to make temporary use of empty lots and bring life back to the downtown. The Gap Filler program, begun a couple of months after the first quake in September 2010 and expanded after a more destructive second quake in February 2011, has created a dance floor with coin-operated music and lights and even a nine-hole mini-golf course in vacant lots across the city. The Greening the Rubble campaign has since the 2010 quake been planting temporary gardens on the sites of demolished buildings. To replace the badly damaged 19th-century ChristChurch Cathedral, a magnificent transitional church by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban opened in 2013 with sturdy cardboard tubes for the roof. Businesses are also trickling back downtown. One bar, built inside shipping containers, has a name that encapsulates the spirit of the entire city: Revival. Facebook Participate A glorious new preserve for the public. One hundred and thirty miles north of San Francisco, the moody bluffs of the Mendocino Coast have long been a spectacular place from which to observe marine life: passing humpback whales, sun-happy sea lions, foamy waves strewn with kelp. The incorporation of the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands — nearly 1,300 acres — gives hikers new access to a contiguous 12-mile stretch of coastline and fields of wildflowers, cypress forests and cliff areas (some overlooking dramatic blowholes, pinnacles and sea caves), much of it previously off-limits to the public. And Congressional proposals to include the north coast lands as part of the California Coastal National Monument have passed, which means better protection and more funds for maintenance; plans also exist to extend the California Coastal Trail through the new preserve. Facebook Participate On a rugged shore, Europe at its best. What if you could combine the rugged beauty you’d find on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast with the ruins of an undiscovered Turkey or Greece, all wrapped in the easygoing nature characteristic of rural Italy — at a fraction of the cost? Turns out you can, on the coast of Albania. The roughly Maryland-size country, between Greece and Montenegro, sits about 45 miles east of Italy on the eastern shores of the Adriatic and has limestone-ringed beaches, ancient ruins like Butrint and waterfront inns where you can stay for less than $50 a night. Rampant development threatened to turn it all to concrete in the years after Communism, but a new government took office in 2013 on promises of keeping the coast authentic. Head to villages like Qeparo, within sight of Corfu, where you can kayak past Cold War submarine tunnels, swim by abandoned forts and watch the tide rise during a dinner of fresh fish at an inn called the Riviera. This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap. Facebook Participate Downtown? Really? Yes, thanks to a thriving food scene. Gone is the musty, lifeless, only-open-for-Kings-hockey-games reputation of downtown Los Angeles. While the museums in this corner of the city are thriving (the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art is nearby), the growing dynamism of downtown is the food scene. Most notable is the Grand Central Market, an arcade of over 30 of the best food vendors in the city. Originally built in 1917, the market has been redone in the past year, attracting popular purveyors like G&B Coffee and, soon, Belcampo Meat Co. Just down the street is Alma, which was named the best new restaurant in the country by Bon Appétit magazine. And where there is good food there is good shopping. Stores have added cachet to the neighborhood; an outlet of the fashion label Acne Studios opened in December, and Aesop, a skin-care specialist, in May. Diners and shoppers alike also have a hip place to stay: An Ace Hotel opened early this year. Facebook Participate Africa’s latest conservation success story is a boon for travelers. Namibia’s communal conservancy movement, which pairs sustainable tourism with rural community outreach, has been a much-heralded success: In 2013, the country’s 79 conservancies received the prestigious Gift to the Earth Award from the World Wildlife Fund, and the stunning Namib Sand Sea Desert joined Unesco’s World Heritage list. Options abound for travelers who want to help the effort, including the Desert Rhino Camp, which Wilderness Safaris runs in partnership with the Save the Rhino Trust; the camp directly supports the conservancy, which has reversed dwindling rhino populations. Wilderness Safaris also plans to open the Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp, on the Hoanib River in the north. And Namibia’s Tourism Board introduced three self-drive routes this year to point visitors toward less-visited parts of the country. Facebook Participate Epic biodiversity, and a newly renovated railway to get you there. Ecuador is famed as the home of the Galápagos, the beloved islands off the coast that feature mind-boggling wildlife — but the mainland is no slouch either. One of the most biodiverse countries in the world, Ecuador has over 1,600 species of birds, 4,000 kinds of orchids, one of the largest condor shelters on the planet — and one-fifth of the country (including the Galápagos) is protected. And there is a new way to see a good chunk of it: the recently refurbished Tren Crucero. The luxury vintage train starts in Quito (the first city ever to be declared a World Heritage site by Unesco) and travels through the Andes, over snow-capped mountains, past volcanoes, around a harrowing turn called the Devil’s Nose and through the countryside until arriving in the bustling city of Guayaquil. The four-day trip includes an excursion to Cotopaxi National Park — a place where you might see deer, wolves, bears or one of those condors. Facebook Participate Now open: One of the world’s largest caves. Son Doong Cave in the Quang Binh province of central Vietnam is one of the world’s largest caves and is now, for the first time, accessible to tourists, thanks to the tour operator Oxalis. Huge shafts of light penetrate its vast caverns, allowing forests of 100-foot-tall trees to thrive in spaces big enough to accommodate 40-story skyscrapers. Colossal 260-foot stalactites are also present. Monkeys, hornbills and flying foxes have all been spotted in this surreal habitat, first fully explored in 2009. While trips into Son Doong are limited in number (only 220 permits for the year) and to visitors with deep pockets (over $6,000 per trip), the nearby and more affordable Tu Lan Cave is also now open to adventurous travelers. Facebook Participate For Australian panache, go west. Perth, the capital of western Australia, has long been feted for its beaches, laid-back vibe and Aboriginal heritage, but lately Australia’s fourth-largest city is exhibiting the signs of a trendy transformation. Regional wine lists? Check. Modish new restaurants in repurposed spaces like stables (the Stables Bar), cottages (the Old Crow) or a printing press building (the Print Hall)? Check. International celebrity chefs including Jamie Oliver, whose Italian spot Jamie’s Italian recently opened? Up-and-coming neighborhoods like Mount Lawley and Northbridge, chockablock with cafes and vintage shops? Check and check. Transformation is evident on a larger scale, too: The Riverside project is infusing the eastern side of the city with parks, shops and housing plazas, while expansion of the new Crown Perth complex includes hotels — Crown Metropol and Crown Promenade — and posh restaurants like Nobu and La Vie Champagne Lounge. Now that first- and business-class lounges have opened at Los Angeles International Airport this year, the national airline Qantas makes it easy to get Down Under in style. Facebook Participate First-class architecture in the Netherlands’ second city. Post-World War II reconstruction has changed the face of one of Europe’s largest ports, where striking, cubed architecture gives shape to the most modern skyline in the country. But it’s not done yet. This is a banner year for ribbon cuttings to celebrate both new and reconfigured space: An overhaul of Rotterdam Centraal  train station in March has already unveiled a new shop-lined pedestrian passageway and the city’s first Starbucks. The renovated Kunsthal museum reopened in February. François Geurds, chef of the two-Michelin-starred restaurant FG, opened another restaurant in January. Come December, the massive arch of the Markthal, whose interior displays 3-D food photographs, becomes the country’s first indoor food hall. Need a launching pad? Check into a brand-new gem: the Rem Koolhaas-designed nhow hotel. Facebook Participate Urban and outdoor pursuits in one (reasonably) compact package. The traveler who wants to do it all should consider Taiwan. This island, roughly the size of the Netherlands, has an easy-to-navigate public transport network that links a cosmopolitan capital with a bounty of natural and man-made wonders. Taipei, whose robust art scene recently earned its selection as the World Design Capital for 2016, has more places to lay your head: A boutique hotel from the homegrown bookstore chain Eslite will join the recent arrivals Mandarin Oriental, Le Meridien and W. All of these should be a convenient base from which to do some sightseeing on 17 bike trails along the shores of Taipei’s many rivers and inlets or to take a foray into the city’s vibrant street food scene with a nightcap at the reservations-only bespoke bar Alchemy, which opened in 2012 to much acclaim. Four hours south by high-speed rail and bus, 70-square-mile Kenting National Park is home to wetlands, white sands, fishing villages and, starting this year, a ferry point for the deep sea fishing and diving paradise of Orchid Island. Up north in Keelung, a new National Museum of Marine Science and Technology has opened, part of a revitalization project at Badouzi Harbor, which is linked to nearby headlands by color-coded walking routes. And it all becomes cheaper to get to later this year, with the launch of budget carriers from China Airlines and TransAsia Airways. Facebook Participate An infusion of hip night life wakes up a humdrum city. Frankfurt, long considered strictly a financial capital and major travel hub, used to land on the culturati map once a year, during its annual book fair. A recent boom of restaurants and clubs, though, makes the case for permanent placement. Leading the city’s transformation is its fast-evolving red light district, where spots like Maxie Eisen, a deli-style cafe by day and a speakeasy-inspired bar by night, offer a sexiness that isn’t unseemly. In the city center, a buzzy pan-Asian restaurant called Moriki was just opened by the Berlin-based chef Duc Ngo with a menu that includes envelope-pushing courses like sushi pizza; and the new sleek Lamoraga, a modern Spanish restaurant, is pulling in the shopping crowds for lunch. By the end of next year, the developer Ardi Goldman plans to reinvent and reopen the famed King Kamehameha Club, which had its original heyday in the 1990s and 2000s. And growth extends to the art world: The 32,000-square-foot underground extension at the Städel Museum earned accolades from around the globe when it opened last year. Facebook Participate An ambitious art scene heads toward the international stage. Building on a strong historical legacy (Addis boasts one of East Africa’s oldest art schools) are a host of events scheduled for 2014: a photography festival, two film festivals and a jazz and world music festival. Thanks to the city’s diverse art institutions and galleries, including the artist-in-residence village Zoma Contemporary Art Center and the Asni Gallery (really more an art collective than a gallery), there is an art opening at least once a week. Even the local Sheraton puts on “Art of Ethiopia,” an annual show of new talent. But it’s the National Museum that, in May and June, hosted this year’s blockbuster exhibit, “Ras Tafari: The Majesty and the Movement,” devoted to Emperor Haile Selassie I and Rastafarianism. Facebook Participate A world-class World Cup getaway. Now that the World Cup is over, escape to Fernando de Noronha, a 21-island archipelago about 330 miles off the coast of one of the host cities, Recife. Here you’ll find 250-foot-high black cliffs muscling against peach-sand beaches, Portuguese hilltop forts and blue coves where humpbacks and spinner dolphins linger. Only one of the islands, Noronha, is inhabited, and the entire chain is protected as a park with just 246 visitors allowed per day. Regulations have kept Noronha relaxed, with only small hotels and roads rough enough to make dune buggies the rental cars of choice. Hike along cliffs to gorgeous beaches like Sancho, dive with sea turtles or climb Morro do Pico, a 1,059-foot-high volcanic pinnacle. Facebook Participate Leather jackets and skinny jeans join cowboy boots. Country music lovers have long made the pilgrimage to Nashville, but now the city has fast gained cachet among rock fans and foodies. The city’s vibrant scene is home to the Black Keys, Kings of Leon, Jeff the Brotherhood and Diarrhea Planet, who all play in town occasionally. And a youthquake is transforming scruffy neighborhoods like 12South and East Nashville into hipster hubs. New hangouts include Pinewood Social, a bar, restaurant, bowling alley and karaoke joint, and the 404, a restaurant and boutique hotel in a former auto garage. Add to that a thriving culinary scene, exemplified by the Music City Eats Festival, back for a second year in September. And Nashville’s old standbys — like the honky-tonk Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and the venerable Ryman — are as fun as ever. Facebook Participate New reasons to play, and watch players, in Scotland’s yards. Riddled with lochs and crested by moody Highlands, Scotland adds to its already considerable outdoorsy appeal this year. In April, the John Muir Way, named for the conservationist originally from Scotland, expanded to 134 miles from 45 miles, newly spanning the farmland and forests of the country’s midsection. Organizers estimate it will take eight to 12 days on foot or four to six by bike to complete the coast-to-coast route running from Muir’s boyhood hometown Dunbar west to the Loch Lomond area. The attractions extend beyond amateur workouts. This summer, Glasgow staged the 2014 Commonwealth Games, Olympic-style competitions for Britain and the former British colonies, and in September Gleneagles resort in the Highlands will host the Ryder Cup golf competition. Sports and hospitality meet at Cromlix House Hotel, a 15-room resort that the tennis champion and local hero Andy Murray opened earlier this year in a Victorian mansion in Dunblane. Facebook Participate An oil boom town gets its cultural legs. Flush with oil money, Calgary has morphed from ho-hum city on the prairie into a cultural hub, with offerings far beyond the Stampede, the annual rodeo and festival. Locals stroll over the tubular Peace Bridge, designed by Santiago Calatrava, opened in 2012. Public art is part of life; in 2013 Jaume Plensa completed Wonderland, a 39-foot-tall steel mesh head installed in front of the new skyline-transforming Norman Foster-designed Bow Tower. They join beloved cultural institutions like the One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theater, whose dancer and choreographer Denise Clarke was in December named to the Order of Canada, one of the country’s highest honors. Facebook Participate Sand and surf, now a (low-cost) hop from Osaka. The yen is the weakest it’s been against the dollar in years, putting Japan more within reach in 2014. For low prices coupled with laid-back attitudes, look way south to the island of Ishigaki, 250 miles south of Okinawa Island and far from the bustle of Tokyo. The 85-square-mile island, largely undiscovered, is home to sunburned surfers, sandy beaches and beautiful coral reefs. And it’s never been easier to reach: A new airport opened here in March 2013, and Japan’s new low-cost carrier, Peach, just began service from Osaka. Facebook Participate A pristine slice of biodiversity is home to a new luxury eco-resort. Set between Mount Kenya and the Great Rift Valley, the Laikipia Plateau teems with wildlife: elephants, leopards, endangered rhinos and one of the highest concentrations of zebras on the continent. Now the area has also become a conservation success story, sustained and protected through an unusual mix of public and private partnerships and a network of environmentally minded ranchers. With the 2013 opening of Segera, a resort owned by Jochen Zeitz, a German-born executive, there is also a new spot to admire its pristine landscapes. The 50,000-acre property includes an enviable collection of contemporary African art, an organic and solar-powered farm and a wine collection focusing on African labels. And more sustainable travel may be on the horizon: A new national park on the area’s southwestern border has been proposed by the government. Facebook Participate A volcano, a temple, a shrine and now a place to stay. This central Javan sultanate draws crowds for its proximity to bewitching attractions: the monumental, wedding cake-esque Buddhist temple Borobudur, the soft-serve-ice-cream-shaped Hindu shrines of Prambanan, and pre-sunrise hikes to summit Indonesia’s friskiest volcano, Mount Merapi (which most recently erupted in 2013). But finding a decent room has never been easy, until now. Thanks to tax breaks for hotel development, 20 new starred hotels, to complement the city’s existing 30, will open through 2015. Among them are Zest Hotel (a Swiss-Belhotel brand) at the end of 2014 and, according to a director of the Tourism Promotion Agency of Yogyakarta, three new properties from Accor, whose brands include Sofitel and ibis. Facebook Participate A ski area spruces up with new terrain, lodging and an entire base village. For decades Northstar-at-Tahoe, on the north end of Lake Tahoe, was a mostly overlooked ski hill. Since 2004, however, more than $1 billion has poured into the resort. Though weather in the region has been fickle so far this season, the improvements are impressive. And they aren’t limited to the base village that has risen at the renamed Northstar, centered around a huge ice rink ringed by couches and fire pits. The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Tahoe opened a few years ago, and Vail Resorts, since buying the ski resort in late 2010, has built an on-mountain day lodge, added more terrain and installed the new Promised Land Express lift on the resort’s Backside. Tahoe is resurgent, as resorts from Squaw Valley to Homewood undertake improvements with an eye toward bidding for the 2026 Winter Olympics. In the next few years expect to see everything from the Cal Neva Resort, once owned by Frank Sinatra, open after a big renovation, to a South Lake Tahoe with new waterfront hotels. Facebook Participate A photogenic (and historic) ale trail. The sprawling northern county of Yorkshire is becoming a big destination for beer lovers, thanks to a recently published guidebook called “Great Yorkshire Beer” and a renewed interest in historic breweries like Samuel Smith (founded in 1758) and Timothy Taylor (from 1858). Spend an evening crawling through the Fat Cat, the Kelham Island Tavern and other award-winning pubs in Sheffield — recently called Britain’s best beer city by the connoisseur Adrian Tierney-Jones — then travel to Leeds, whose compact center is home to the Victoria Hotel, the Cross Keys and other public houses that pull pints on traditional hand pumps. A final stay in the photogenic city of York offers a Tudor-style pub at the end of every cobbled lane, as well as modern beer temples like York Tap, Pivni and the House of Trembling Madness. Facebook Participate Reborn, relentless and still over the top. Five years ago, one of the planet’s most ambitious cities appeared to be dying. Crushed with debt, Dubai found its megaprojects and skyscrapers scuttled or scrapped. The city went from juggernaut to joke. But now, it’s back. Economically surging, Dubai has won its bid to host World Expo 2020 and has unveiled its Tourism Vision, also for 2020, a plan to attract 20 million tourists — double the current crowd. Last October witnessed the first passenger terminal at Dubai World Central Al Maktoum International Airport, and travelers will discover colossal new hotels like the 555-room Conrad Dubai and the 77-story JW Marriott Marquis Dubai, which Guinness World Records recognizes as the tallest hotel in the world. This year, a new tram system will be inaugurated, along with some theme parks, including the first phase of Dubai Adventure Studios, the first phase of IMG Worlds of Adventure, and Holy Quran Park (devoted to the Islamic holy book). Facebook Participate New saints, a new(ish) pope and newly restored treasures beckon. Pope Francis, who has nearly 4.8 million followers on Twitter and routinely makes headlines for doing things like inviting atheists to join the cause for peace in his Christmas message, is widely viewed as reinvigorating the scandal-plagued, conservative-leaning Roman Catholic Church. (Just ask Time magazine, which last December named him the 2013 Person of the Year.) The first South American pope is so popular that the Vatican estimated that nearly a million visitors came in April for Holy Week and the canonization of John XXIII and John Paul II. Services commemorating the new saints will continue throughout the year. The faithful can also enjoy the fruits of restorations that have taken years, like that of Bernini’s colonnade in St. Peter’s Square and the reopening of the Via Triumphalis necropolis, a vast ancient Roman cemetery first uncovered in the 1950s. And pilgrims can stay up-to-date on news and events, including restorations and exhibitions, thanks to the Pope’s new mobile app. Facebook Participate South American beach towns, before they go upscale. Around glamorous Punta del Este and boho-chic José Ignacio, there’s no deficiency of boutique hotels, expat art galleries and exclusive waterfront brasseries. But farther east along the Uruguayan Riviera, a relatively untrodden stretch of Atlantic coast tucked between Argentina and Brazil, sun, sand and simplicity remain the draw — for now. In the Rocha region, villages like Cabo Polonio, La Pedrera, San Antonio and Punta del Diablo are just starting to attract serious international attention, bringing a sprinkling of first-rate accommodation — like Brisas, a clifftop 14-room inn restored by an Argentine tech mogul — without compromising the area’s natural charms: miles of undeveloped beach, rolling pastures and a culture where gaucho cowboys and fishermen with wooden boats aren’t just props. Facebook Participate A cultural capital springs to life. Chennai, in the state of Tamil Nadu (and formerly known as Madras), was long considered the gateway to popular South Indian tourist destinations like Kerala but was overlooked as an attraction itself. It is, however, a national cultural capital and home to several dance and music schools like Kalakshetra for dance and the Music Academy for Carnatic South Indian music, which both regularly hold performances around town. There are also historic sites aplenty, including the Kapaleeswarar Temple, built in the name of the Hindu god Shiva. Fresh buzz makes this city especially enticing: Several major hotels including the Park Hyatt have recently opened, and there is a slew of new and trendy clubs, boutiques and restaurants, including Ottimo for excellent pizzas. Facebook Participate An African luxury hot spot that’s become easier to get to. This archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean now has one of the world’s most expensive hotels. The listed price for a villa at the North Island resort, on a private island where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stayed during their honeymoon, ranges from 2,582 to 4,079 euros (about $3,670 to $5,800) per night; the Doubletree by Hilton Seychelles, which opened last year is, thankfully, more affordable. The appeal goes beyond pampering and powdery beaches: The Seychelles is also home to some 100,000 giant Aldabra tortoises that live on a coral atoll that is a Unesco World Heritage site. Air Seychelles recently signed code-share agreements with Air Berlin, Cathay Pacific Airways and other airlines, making these islands about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Africa more accessible. Facebook Participate A Phuket-like hideaway, but still unspoiled. The southern Thailand town of Krabi lies just a 45-minute boat ride across the Andaman Sea from Phuket. But you can spare yourself the trip to Phuket — plenty of riches lie here, and you don’t have to fight the crowds to enjoy them. Krabi sits next to the Mu Koh Lanta National Park, a prime spot for hiking, rock climbing and elephant trekking. If you do get restless, there are about 130 pristine islands nearby that are ripe for exploration and virtually undeveloped save for a few ancient monasteries. And Krabi, which used to have few options for accommodations and was hard to get to, is now more tourist-friendly. A number of hotels have opened in recent years, including Phulay Bay, a Ritz-Carlton property. A marina, Port Takola, is in the works and will be home to restaurants, night life and shopping, and a new terminal that has opened at Krabi Airport means that there are more flights to and from this gem. Facebook Participate Ditch those poles. Art and bike trails await. This ski town has a big development off-piste: The long-awaited reinvented Aspen Art Museum opened its doors this summer. The 33,000-square-foot space, designed by the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban, is meant to reflect the mountain experience. Visitors first take a lift to the roof and take in the view from the sculpture garden before descending to tour the galleries. There is also plenty of news for outdoor types this year, too, with new mountain biking trails planned throughout Aspen and Snowmass, a new mountain skills center and expanded lift-serviced biking. Facebook Participate Natural wonders are in danger. Go see them before it’s too late. The Icelandic government has spent decades protecting its glaciers, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and permafrost mounds in the Thjorsarver Wetlands, part of the central highlands, which constitute some 40 percent of the entire country, mostly in the interior. But last year, the government announced plans to revoke those protections, allowing for the construction of hydropower plants (instead of glaciers and free-flowing rivers, imagine man-made reservoirs, dams, paved roads and power lines). “If they get into this area, there will be no way to stop them from destroying the wetlands completely,” said Arni Finnsson, the chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. If you ever want to see Iceland in all of its famously raw natural beauty, go now. Facebook Participate Soundscapes and culture shine in northern Sweden. A hotbed of hardcore and heavy metal music through the 1990s, this northern city has welcomed all genres during its tenure as a European Capital of Culture this year. Music has taken center stage at outdoor opera performances, a crowdsourced music festival and an orchestral tribute to the local hardcore band Refused. Visual arts focused on the culture of indigenous Sami people are on exhibit at Bildmuseet, the city’s contemporary arts museum that reopened in 2012 in a glass-and-wood building designed by Henning Larsen Architects. And it’s all easier to reach thanks to a new higher-speed rail connection from Stockholm. Facebook Participate Skip smog-choked cities — and face masks — and head out to China’s wild frontier. With pollution skyrocketing in China’s showcase cities, visitors to the country are increasingly seeking out greener pastures to explore. Set deep in the tropics of southern Yunnan province, Xishuangbanna is about as lush as you can get — the region boasts the richest biodiversity in China, including some of the country’s last wild elephants. In February 2013, the area went upscale with its first five-star hotel — the Anantara Xishuangbanna Resort & Spa, which organizes tea-leaf picking trips in mountainside plantations. More action-oriented experiences are possible, as well, such as the tour group WildChina’s jungle biking trips or treks along the caravan route plied by tea traders centuries ago. Facebook Participate A mountain makeover from overlooked to opulent. Andermatt has long been a quiet town of Alpine farmers and bargain-seeking skiers. But the former Swiss Army outpost began its transformation into a bona fide ski destination with the opening last December of the Chedi Andermatt. The 104-room resort, housed in a modernized chalet with a Japanese restaurant among several dining options, indoor and outdoor pools and a 10-treatment-room spa, is just the first phase of a big new development of apartment buildings, homes, five more hotels and a golf course in the coming years over 321 acres. The pedestrian village will offer skiers access by gondola to the nearly 9,800-foot Gemsstock Mountain, with future lifts to the larger nearby ski area of Sedrun planned to open in 2015. Facebook Participate In the land of cars, cycling (and culture) get the limelight. An urban cycling model has arrived in Indianapolis: the new $63 million, eight-mile bike-friendly Indy Cultural Trail. The path connects five downtown neighborhoods, including arty Fountain Square, to top downtown sites, including the Capitol Building, City Market and White River State Park, a 250-acre park that hosts the Indianapolis Zoo and six more major attractions. Bicycles can be rented along the paved and lighted pathway, allowing riders to cruise past public art, including a motion-activated fireflylike swarm of LED lights. City officials say that planners from Cologne, Germany, to Portland, Ore., have come to see how the city most famous for a 500-mile car race managed to swap auto for bike lanes and still keep everything rolling smoothly. Facebook Participate River cruising swells on the Danube of Asia. Like the Danube in Europe, the Mekong River in Southeast Asia has become a vital river cruising course, with a variety of small-ship itineraries linking Vietnam and Cambodia. Late last year, Pandaw River Expeditions upgraded two of its ships, the Mekong Pandaw and Tonle Pandaw, enlarging public spaces, adding gyms and stocking cabins with iPads. In 2012, the company launched the 32-guest Angkor Pandaw, offering three- to seven-night itineraries, while Avalon Waterways set the 32-passenger Avalon Angkor sailing between Ho Chi Minh City and Siem Reap over seven nights. In September, Aqua Expeditions will introduce the 20-suite Aqua Mekong, offering guide-led shore excursions to temples, villages and wildlife-rich areas via skiffs. Facebook Participate Out of an economic crisis, a city surges back. Vibrancy and innovation can bloom even in hard times. Exhibit A is Greece’s ancient capital, which was hit hard by the global economic crisis and yet is seeing change at sites old and new. First the old: At the Acropolis, the famous Caryatids statues continue to get a restoration in 2014. And the new: The National Museum of Contemporary Art will soon open in a former brewery complex. Neighborhoods have also seen a resurgence, including the quickly gentrifying Monastiraki and the still gritty Kerameikos-Metaxourgeio; the latter will get a cultural lift in 2015 from the biannual ReMap art event. Travelers will have a new lodging option by the end of the year, when a revived Emporikon Hotel opens on Aiolou, a street that is also home to a host of new dining spots. Facebook Participate A scenic, low-key destination on the verge of discovery. Most vacationers to La Republica hole up in the all-inclusives north and east, overlooking the rarely traveled southwest. The port town of Barahona is the gateway to the cactus-strewn region’s riches, like the hauntingly beautiful Bahia de las Aguilas beach and the eight climate zones at the geological depression Hoyo de Pelempito, both blissfully devoid of people. But there are signs of the government’s vision to develop the area. The abandoned former Barcelo Bahoruco Beach Resort will partly open at the end of 2014, and two separate 300-room projects — near La Canoa and San Rafael Beach — are in the final stages of design approval. For now, you can experience the quiet life at the thatch-roofed Casa Bonita, or at Rancho Platon, which has a tree house raised between the palms. Facebook Participate Chasing the northern lights? This might be the year. There aren't many reasons to visit the frigid region surrounding the North Pole, but the darkest months, from September through March, offer the most stunning of them: northern lights, that colorful spectacle of solar particles entering our atmosphere. And there are some comfortable ways to see them, thanks to hotels offering northern lights safaris, including the newly opened Ion Luxury Adventure Hotel in Iceland and the Icehotel in Swedish Lapland (and actually within the Arctic Circle). Facebook Participate On the African coast, music thrives in a commercial capital. Tanzania may be best known for the snow-capped peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro and the game-packed plains of the Serengeti, but the real pulse of the country is found in its largest city, Dar es Salaam. An eclectic mix of music echoes through the beach clubs, open-air bars and nightclubs of this Indian Ocean coastal city. Old-school dance music competes with Swahili hip-hop and traditional drumming, all drawing from the city’s African, Indian and Arab influences. Add in the street food, the beaches and the fact that the year-old African low-cost carrier Fastjet uses Dar as its hub, and it’s easy to see that this commercial capital is more than a stopover on the way to Tanzania’s natural splendor. It is an African metropolis coming into its own. Facebook Participate A revitalized city center welcomes new museums and streetcars. Atlanta plans several ribbon cuttings in 2014, but the main event is the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, opened in June next to the Centennial Olympic Park and the Georgia Aquarium downtown. The 42,000-square-foot, environmentally friendly museum features permanent galleries devoted to domestic and international rights struggles and houses the Martin Luther King Jr. papers owned by Morehouse College. By November, visitors will be able to take the new Atlanta Streetcar on a 2.7-mile loop that will link the park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site and other stops. Another parkside attraction, the 94,000-square-foot College Football Hall of Fame, is opening in time for fall kickoff of the N.C.A.A. season. Facebook Participate Skiing, soba and snow monkeys. For nearly a century, visitors have been lured to this ski destination, a 90-minute drive from Nagano, by affordability and a host of charms: fine powder, long slopes and charming cobblestone lanes lined with traditional ryokan inns, generations-old soba noodle shops and natural hot spring baths. But the recent arrival of stylish, foreigner-friendly restaurants, cafes and bars have infused the area with new energy, offering travelers just the right mix of old and new. Microbrews and excellent coffee are served at ski-in/ski-out Craft Room, while Tamon prepares innovative kaiseki cuisine using local ingredients. The lantern-hung rooms at Jon Nobi are popular among international skiers, as is its chic izakaya restaurant Himatsuri, inspired by the town’s fire festival, held annually on Jan. 15. The Asian operator Backyard Travel offers 10-day itineraries to explore Nozawa and nearby sights like a seventh-century temple and a refuge for the area’s famed snow monkeys. Facebook Participate Serbian wine? Time to take a sip. The Balkan Peninsula has a wine culture that dates back hundreds of years, but war and political unrest over the last century decimated Serbian vineyards. As recently as a decade ago, Serbia produced virtually no wine that met international standards. But progress has been swift. Recently, small producers have revived the Subotica-Horgos wine region near the northern border with Hungary. Here, the Palic Wine Route has been attracting domestic wine tourists who spend days sampling local cabernet sauvignon in wine cellars, sipping dry Trijumf white during dinner at Bosscaffe and unwinding in the Hotel Galleria‘s high-tech spa. Facebook Participate A museum’s entrance makes for something new in the state of Denmark. Even angst-ridden Prince Hamlet, literature’s most famous Dane, might be cheered by the new Maritime Museum of Denmark, which recently opened in his hometown Elsinore. Designed by the architectural firm Bjarke Ingels Group, the glassy structure is built into a U-shaped dry dock and filled with slanted floors and zigzag passageways that evoke ocean-rocked ships’ decks. Maritime relics — from torpedoes to Lego pirate ships — mix with electronic maps and films that explore the romance of the sea, shipboard existence and trade, both centuries ago and today. Interactive exhibits allow you to run your own trade company, navigate by the stars and ink a sailor’s tattoo. For additional watery wonders, head to Copenhagen’s new Blue Planet aquarium, billed as the largest in Northern Europe. Facebook Participate Haute cuisine comes to the lush landscapes of the Lake District. The British dining scene is expanding beyond London, and the chef Simon Rogan deserves much of the credit, having helped elevate the Lake District village of Cartmel into one of England’s most unlikely culinary destinations. His three restaurants in the medieval village — the Michelin two-starred L’Enclume, Rogan & Company and his most recent addition, the Pig & Whistle — have menus featuring whatever’s fresh on his nearby farm. Cartmel is also home to a celebrated farmers’ market, Cartmel Cheeses and the Cartmel Village shop, renowned for its sticky toffee pudding. What’s more, the village is a cozy base from which to explore the Lake District, once an inspiration to William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter. Facebook Participate New peaks open up for alpine adventurers. This Himalayan republic is the mother lode of alpinism, home to eight of the world’s 10 highest summits (including Everest). So when a Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation subcommittee recommended last September that Nepal allow access to 165 new peaks in the Kanchenjunga massif this year — 13 of them above 23,000 feet — the world’s mountaineering community was aflutter. Some welcomed the announcement, while others dismissed it, saying the government had stretched the meaning of “peak” in a few cases to include subpeaks within mountains that were already accessible in order to rake in more in fees. Even so, the proposal was significant since it was the first such release in a decade. And though the government scaled back the scope of the original proposal, it did formally open 104 of the new peaks in May. Facebook Participate Feel like reminiscing? A city is awash in anniversaries. Vienna is home to some 450 balls each year, from traditional waltzes to the “seriously outlandish” Rosenball for the gay community, and this year is the 200th anniversary since the city’s ball culture took root. You could mark the occasion by attending one, but it wouldn’t be the only date to celebrate in the capital city this year. Visitors can pay homage at the Sigmund Freud Museum since it has been 75 years since the psychoanalyst’s death. The city is also commemorating the 100th anniversary of World War I with special exhibits and the European Peace Walk, a permanent route from Vienna to Trieste through five countries. There are also new art spaces, a new transportation hub, more direct flights from the United States and offbeat places to stay, like Urbanauts’ former storefronts or Chez Cliché’s themed apartments, with décor inspired by fictional hosts, such as Marie Therese, who loves Baroque furnishings and classical music. Facebook Participate Even a 1,200-year-old lost city has some new draws. If you’ve seen the temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, then the country’s lost city of Mahendraparvata, its majestic temples on Phnom Kulen and the stone animal carvings at the site of Srah Damrei (elephant pond) should be next on your list. About 30 miles from Siem Reap, Mahendraparvata predates Angkor Wat by about 350 years and was the birthplace of the Khmer Empire in A.D. 802. Although the city has been known about for several decades, researchers in 2013 discovered new temples and a network of roads and dikes that had been concealed under thick mountain vegetation. Facebook Participate Croatia’s architectural and musical gem lies inland. Forget Croatia’s beloved coast: The inland city Varazdin is one of the country’s most picturesque and well-preserved areas. One hour north of Zagreb, this small metropolis of 50,000 has an immaculate cobblestoned town center and is stocked with Baroque churches and palaces like the Draskovic. The theme continues with an annual Baroque music festival, but that’s where it ends. Other music-themed festivals and concerts are decidedly modern and change from year to year: One, the Radar Festival, for contemporary stars, has drawn names such as Bob Dylan and Carlos Santana, and various other festivals throughout the year such as Spancir Fest, celebrated from the end of August to September, attract artists and musicians from around Europe. Facebook Participate Reinventing a Florida city’s reputation. Once mocked for its thousands of green benches dotted with senior citizens, St. Petersburg is anything but stationary. With a redeveloped waterfront, a stunning Dali Museum, and sophisticated restaurants in place, the downtown energy is now heading up historic Central Avenue, thanks in part to the craft beer scene. Among the many recent arrivals, artsy Cycle Brewing features Fixie and Endo ales, while Green Bench Brewing Co., the name a nod to those erstwhile icons, invites winter escapees to its sunny taproom and beer garden. Refuel at the ambitious Rococo Steak, set in a renovated 1920s YWCA, then hit the Tap Room of the reinvented Hollander Hotel. Facebook Participate More flights and lodges in Central America’s eco-frontier. Twenty years ago, when Francis Ford Coppola opened Blancaneaux Lodge in western Belize, relatively few travelers had ventured into this small Central American country. Slowly they arrived, many of them curious to witness the scenery that had captivated the film director, which he described in an email as “completely remote, with a beautiful pristine river you could drink the water out of and the most star-studded night sky I had ever seen.” Since then, upscale rustic hotels have cropped up all over Belize — there’s El Secreto in Ambergris Caye, for example, and Belcampo, an eco-lodge and sustainable farm in the south that’s about to unveil a sophisticated redesign — adding to the lure of rain forests, Mayan ruins and coral reefs. It helps that Belize is easier to reach: Delta recently began nonstop flights from Los Angeles to Belize City, and regional carriers like Tropic Air have expanded their routes, connecting Belize to resorts like Cancún and making remote towns like San Ignacio more accessible. Facebook Participate What you’d expect (natural beauty) and not (world-class museum). This semisecret gem of the South Pacific, a three-hour flight from Sydney, is attracting visitors like never before. Thank infrastructural upgrades like a refurbished international airport, improved roads and bridges, and the arrival of high-profile properties like the new Hilton Noumea La Promenade Residences and the Sheraton New Caledonia Deva Resort & Spa. An island itinerary reads like a fantasy novel: snorkeling and diving in one of the world’s largest lagoons, an aquamarine stunner populated by thousands of coral and marine species and home to the world’s second largest reef (after the Great Barrier); horseback riding through verdant mountains and indigenous Kanak villages; kayaking by moonlight among the submerged forest of the Blue River Provincial Park. The cosmopolitan capital, Nouméa, has its own allures, like Le Roof, where you might spot dolphins diving in the distance while savoring the fresh oysters, and the Tjibaou Cultural Center, a Renzo Piano-designed museum housing one of the world’s largest collections of Pacific art. Facebook Participate Once a kitsch capital, now earning a reputation for food and sports. Known for its remarkable natural beauty and tourist kitsch, Niagara Falls is now evolving into a draw for those who love food as well as those who seek thrills. The Niagara Falls Culinary Institute opened a high-end restaurant, deli, patisserie and gelateria steps from the American Falls, transforming the area’s dining scene overnight. A gastro pub called the Griffon Pub, which features 50 beers on tap and creative New American dishes like gnocchi poutine, opened a few miles east of the falls last year. On the Canadian side, oenophiles can get a taste of the region’s growing wine scene just a short bike ride from the falls along the Niagara River Recreation Trail. Nondining attractions are plentiful, too. This year, Canadians have hosted two major War of 1812 bicentennial re-enactments in the area, and since May visitors have been able to see the falls from a new luxury catamaran. Tourism officials on the Canadian side appear poised to allow daredevils to zip line across or rappel down the Niagara Gorge later this year.

Business   Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War. Advertisement It’s war. You size up your warriors — all three of them. There’s strongest A, next-strongest B, and weakest C. Your opponent has three different-strength warriors as well. Warriors will fight in pairs (each warrior fights just one fight), and whichever side wins the most contests is the victor. You know your opponent will present her warriors in descending order by strength, and you’re initially tempted to do the same, matching your strongest warrior with her strongest warrior, the next-strongest with next-strongest, and so on. But is there a better way? Our puzzle this week is by the award-winning mathematics writer Dana Mackenzie. It’s about gaining advantage in what appears to be a fair game, and its elegant simplicity hides a tough mathematical core that took him and colleague Howard Stern 30 years to crack (Dana Mackenzie tells the remarkable story in the bottom section of this post). We’ll simulate the affair with a deck of numbered cards. It’s — Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War The game requires three people, one of whom serves only as the dealer. The dealer has a deck of six cards numbered one through six. She shuffles the cards and then deals three cards to each player, making sure, as she deals the cards, to place them in order from highest to lowest (she can look at the cards as she’s dealing them without the players seeing their values). Cards are then put face-down into the middle of the table. Player 1 plays a card, without turning it over; then player 2 plays a card, without turning it over. Play continues in the same way until all the cards have been paired up. Only then do the players turn over all the cards, revealing who has won each battle (highest card in each pair wins). In what order should you play your cards? Bonus: How should you play your cards if you’re each dealt four cards? Seven? Super-Bonus (The one that takes 30 years to figure out): How should you play if you’re dealt N cards? Give it a try with Numberplay Inventor-in-Residence Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War gizmo. The story of Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War as told by Dana Mackenzie The saga of One-Round War begins with a college friend of mine named Howard Stern, who went on to graduate school at M.I.T. In 1980, his first year there, he came up with a related question: Suppose two backgammon teams are going to play a match. The top players on each team are supposed to play against each other, the No. 2 player against the No. 2 player, and so forth. Assuming Team A ranks their players honestly, can Team B strategically put their players in a different order and thereby increase their chances of winning? Howard deserves an enormous amount of credit for three things. First, he set up the problem in a way that could be solved. The problem as stated above is too vague and general to have a definitive solution, but he found a more precise version that does. Second, he found a proof-of-concept that Team B can win more than half their games on average. Third, even when he got stuck, Howard never gave up. For 30 years, every time he met a mathematician or computer scientist who might know the answer, he told them about the problem. Finally, in 2012 he saw an article in our college alumni magazine about me, and e-mailed to ask if I might have any clue. I used to be a research mathematician, but by then I had been a writer for more than 15 years. For most of that time I had barely missed doing math; What I remembered most was the endless frustration of working on problems that wouldn’t budge. But Howard’s problem was different. It quickly sucked me in, and became as much of an obsession for me as it had been for him. Over the following year, I spent at least a hundred hours working on it, devised a three-stage strategy and eventually obtained a satisfying and unambiguous solution. I can’t say that there was one great moment of insight that did it. It was more of a kitchen sink strategy: Throw everything I know at the problem, try every little trick I can think of, and see what works. Most of the things I tried didn’t work, but enough things did to keep me going. The very last phase was to come up with a better way of posing the problem. Gary Antonick felt, and I agree, that Howard’s backgammon version requires too much explanation before you get to the heart of the problem. I am indebted to Gary for forcing me to distill the problem down to its essentials. We eventually settled on a card game as the clearest way to explain it. Gary had a hand in codifying what eventually turned out to be a very simple set of rules, and in this way One-Round War was born. And a special note to math lovers everywhere: Dana Mackenzie’s “The Universe in Zero Words: The Story of Mathematics as Told through Equations,” which Nature calls “a celebration of the succinct and the singular in human expression,” is now available in paperback.

Solution and Commentary to Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War The key to victory in this problem is capitalizing on your opponent’s fixed strategy: she will always lead with her strongest cards, so play your weakest cards against those. Let her win and waste her firepower. After the initial dust has cleared you’ll have the advantage, on average, because you’ll still have your strongest cards, while she’s stuck with weaklings.  But how exactly do you play your weak cards? It depends on your goal. To maximize your chances of winning the overall game, or more than half the contests, your should sacrifice up to half your cards: 1 card in the 3-trick game, 2 cards in the 4-trick game, and 3 cards in the 7-trick game. The strategy for N cards depends on whether N is odd or even, as detailed in the full explanation by Dana Mackenzie below. But if your goal is to beat your opponent as badly as possible (on average), you’d want to sacrifice fewer cards in order to potentially win more tricks, even though this aggressive strategy would reduce your overall chance of winning. You’d sacrifice your worst card in the 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-trick games, and only lead with your worst 2 cards once you got to 7 tricks. The strategy becomes more complicated with N cards. Here’s Dana Mackenzie with the complete recap: I was fascinated by the discussion of this week’s problem, and it went in a completely different direction from what I had anticipated! First, early in the week Joe Fendel pointed out that there are two possible objective functions to maximize. Gary Antonick and I had (intentionally) not made it clear which one we wanted. Goal (1) would be to maximize the expected number of tricks taken, and goal (2) would be to maximize the expected number of games won. As I mentioned in an early response (under the pseudonym “Word Lover”), goal (1) is the one that Howard and I took 30 years to solve. Goal (2) seems more logical because, after all, for most games the margin of victory doesn’t matter; it’s all about winning or losing. However, I don’t think that either Howard or I seriously thought about goal (2) because it looked harder. As I explained in my comment, the beauty of goal (1) is that it’s linear. The expected number of tricks won can be obtained just by adding the expected win probability for each card. By contrast, goal (2) is nonlinear. So looking at the problem through the glasses of a mathematician, it seemed as if we should try that problem first. And I’m not the only one who reached that conclusion! In the earliest reference I could find to Howard’s problem, a 1980 paper called “Scheduling Players in Team Competitions” by Arjang Assad et. al., they wrote, “There are, as yet, no efficient solution techniques for problems of this class…” Instead they looked at three “surrogates” for goal (2), one of which is goal (1). Fortunately, Bill from Long Beach, didn’t know any of this and just went ahead and solved goal (2)! It’s a very common sense solution, and his proof looks airtight to me. He says that if the number of cards per hand (N) is odd (i.e., N = 2m – 1), then you should simply play your best m cards against the opponent’s worst m, in order. It’s easily seen that if there is any way for you to take m tricks, then this way will do it. So this is an optimal strategy. That leaves the question of finding the best strategy for goal (2) if there is an even number of cards per hand, i.e., N = 2m. Jeff Mallett has presented pretty compelling computer evidence that in this case you want to sacrifice (m-1) tricks, playing your best (m+1) cards against the opponent’s worst in order. As I write this on Sunday, no one has yet given a mathematical proof, but I feel certain that it’s true. I am so glad that I didn’t specify which goal I was interested in, because if I had specified goal (1), perhaps this whole interesting discussion about goal (2) would not have happened! Now, what about goal (1)? Here there was also significant progress made, as much as I could expect in a week. B. Rubin suggested the idea of forming a matrix or array containing the probability of our i-th card beating the opponent’s j-th card. D-Ferg actually gave a formula for these probabilities. These matrices are key to Howard’s approach to the problem, so let’s look at a few of them: I have tinkered with B. Rubin and D-Ferg’s definitions slightly. First, I’ve multiplied by 2N-choose-N (the common denominator of the probabilities) to get integer matrices. Second, I’ve rearranged the rows so that the entry in row i and column j is the number of hands in which my i-th worst card beats the opponent’s j-th worst card. That’s the way Howard chose to do it, and for better or for worse I’ve stuck with his notation. Now we can state goal (2) succinctly: How can we choose one element from each row and column in a way that maximizes the sum of the elements? For example, in the case N = 4 the optimal choice is 55 + 53 + 55 + 1. This type of problem is called a linear assignment problem by computer scientists. However, the theory does not give us much of a clue about the answer. Computer scientists have found rapid algorithms to solve such problems, but a solution algorithm is not the same as a solution! All the magic of the problem is contained in Howard’s matrices, and believe me, they are truly magical. I wish I had room to tell you all of their cool properties, but let me point out a few simple ones. First, they are symmetric under reflection about the southwest-northeast diagonal. (I call this the “anti-main diagonal”.) Also, pairs of numbers that are symmetric about the southeast-northwest diagonal (the “main diagonal”) always add to the same number. Not only that, Howard observed and proved a remarkable fact. Take any 2-by-2 square in one of these matrices. Add the northeast and southwest entries and subtract the northwest and southeast entries. If your 2-by-2 square lay above the main diagonal, the result is positive; if it straddled the main diagonal, the result is zero; and if it lay below the main diagonal, the result is negative. Using these facts and not much else, Howard showed that the optimal strategy always consists of sacrificing some tricks, with your sacrificed cards in reverse order of strength, and “playing to win” the rest of the tricks, with your cards ordered from stronger to weaker. For example, in the N = 7 case, an allowable solution would be G-F-A-B-C-D-E (which is in fact the correct strategy, as noted by D-Ferg). Another allowable solution would be G-A-D-B-C-E-F. Howard’s result greatly decreases the number of possible solutions, from N-factorial to 2N-3. Howard also made the same conjecture that D-Ferg came up with: in the optimal solution, you should play your k worst cards against the opponent’s k best cards, for some k. However, Howard couldn’t prove his conjecture, and had no idea what the correct value of k might be. The problem lay fallow for 30 years. To confirm Howard’s conjecture, and compute k, I had to dig a lot deeper into Howard’s matrices. First, I showed that the optimal solution must be symmetric about the anti-main diagonal. This was the first key step, and I was shocked when I succeeded. It frequently happens in mathematics that a symmetric objective function has a maximum with the same symmetry, but you can’t count on it. In fact, if it were always true, we wouldn’t live in the universe we know today, because the Higgs boson is a result of an optimization problem with a broken symmetry. When combined with Howard’s result, this showed that the sacrificed games in fact lie on the anti-main diagonal. In other words, if we decide to sacrifice our i-th worst card, we should always play it against the opponent’s i-th best card. This rules out G-A-D-B-C-E-F, because if we decide to sacrifice card D it should be placed in the fourth position, not the third. However, G-A-E-B-C-D-F is still a possible solution. Our third-worst card (E) is sacrificed to our opponent’s third-best card. The next step was to show there are no “gaps.” This was the conjecture that D-Ferg made and Howard before him. The idea of this part of the proof was quite subtle, and in fact I could only complete it after doing the last part—finding the optimal number of games to sacrifice. In essence, I had to show that a permutation with gaps would fall short of the best gap-free permutation, which I could compute exactly. It requires some delicate estimates, and I have only succeeded in showing the “no-gaps” principle for N greater than 10 million. I suspect that the same argument will work, albeit with more effort, for N greater than 400. Howard has confirmed the “no-gaps” principle for N less than 60. I would greatly appreciate it if somebody with a supercomputer could bridge the gap, and show the no-gaps principle holds for N between 60 and 400. After all this grubby work, the best part of the problem is the last step—finding the optimal number of tricks to sacrifice. D-Ferg tabulated these numbers in one of his posts, and the pattern looks mysterious indeed. But here is the secret (up to one nuisance detail that I’ll get to in a second). To figure out the number of games to sacrifice, add the numbers in the 2N-th row of Pascal’s triangle. When the sum becomes greater than the center entry, stop. If you have added r numbers, then the correct number of tricks to sacrifice is N + 1 – r. Let’s check it for N = 7. Looking at the 14-th row of Pascal’s triangle, we compute 1 + 14 + 91 + 364 + 1001 + 2002 = 3471 > 3432 (the center entry of the 14-th row). Because we had to add six entries, the number of games to sacrifice is 7 + 1 – 6 = 2. The nuisance detail? This procedure would give the correct answer if we literally forfeited the tricks that we intended to sacrifice. However, in the real game of Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War, we might occasionally win a trick we had intended to lose. As Jeff Mallett observed (though not quite in this context), when we are playing the optimal strategy, the expected number of tricks that we will win by accident, especially when N is large, is much less than 1. Thus, in some cases, the method I have just told you may sometimes underestimate the correct number by 1, but it will never underestimate by more. For obsessive-compulsive types, there is a formula that takes into account the “accidental” tricks. However, it’s slightly less elegant than the method I have just described, so I won’t give it here. If you’d like to read a more literary version of the puzzle and its solution, please check out A Formula That Shows How to Cheat & Triumph at Tournaments, which I recently wrote for Nautilus. Finally, let me point out that a couple of readers mentioned earlier occurrences of this problem. Lee from London wrote that the N = 3 version was in effect solved more than 2300 years ago by a legendary Chinese military strategist named Sun Bin! So perhaps we should call it “Sun Bin’s One-Round War.” Thanks so much to all of you who wrote in, and I hope some of you will be motivated to continue thinking about variations on the problem. What about multiple-player versions? What about Howard’s original version, which involved a backgammon match? In Stern-Mackenzie One-Round War, card 8 beats card 7 every time. But in an actual sporting competition, such as backgammon, the higher-rated player will not win with 100 percent certainty. It would be interesting to devise a more realistic model of the advantage of one player over another, and see how robust our results are.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 14. Advertisement   PARIS— text starts hereFor some time, the shopkeepers of the Ternes quarter have been receiving a number of counterfeit ten franc pieces. On Saturday a woman named Wetche was arrested for attempting to pass one of these pieces, which all bear the head of Napoleon III and the date 1864. At her home in Boulogne-sur-Seine, the police found hidden in an attic over the little watch and clock repairing shop kept by her husband, a complete counterfeiting outfit and a large number of the false coins. The whole family are now under arrest. 1939: Colonel Raynal, Hero of Verdun Dies at 72 PARIS — text starts here Colonel Sylvain Raynal, hero of the defense of Verdun in 1916, who held out in Port de Vaux against overwhelming German forces for a week, only to be forced to surrender, died yesterday at Boulogne of a heart attack. He was seventy-two. He had retired from the army in 1926 to his farm at Maraval, in Périgord. He was an honorary member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, an American veterans’ organization. Astounded by Colonel Raynal’s feat of staving off their advance with but a handful of poilus, the Germans in 1916 treated their captive as a hero, and the Crown Prince himself accepted his sword of surrender. At a prison in Mainz, he was given special status.  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage.

Science   Mediterranean Diet for Diabetes Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement More good news on the Mediterranean diet. Sticking to a Mediterranean-style diet may help reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes, even when people don’t lose weight or increase exercise levels. The Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil, nuts, fish, beans, fruits and vegetables, with few dairy products and moderate alcohol consumption. The study, published in Annals of Internal Medicine, randomly assigned 3,541 men and women, ages 55 to 80 and free of diabetes, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with either two ounces of extra-virgin olive oil, one supplemented with an ounce of mixed nuts a day, and a control group advised to eat a low-fat diet. They followed the participants for an average of about four years, with no intervention to increase physical activity or limit calories. Compared with the control group, and after adjusting for health and socioeconomic factors, the risk for diabetes was 40 percent lower with the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil and 18 percent lower with the diet supplemented with nuts. “The strength of our study is that it has a large number of participants with a long follow-up and a randomized design,” said an author, Dr. Ramón Estruch, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Barcelona. “The diet works by itself without considering physical activity or changes in weight, which were insignificant between groups.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/14/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nutrition: Mediterranean Diet for Diabetes.

Sports   Speed of Courts a Hot Topic at Australian Open. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN ROTHENBERGJAN. 12, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — With the first Grand Slam of the year quickly approaching, one of the hottest topics among players has been just how quick play will be at the Australian Open. The top seed Rafael Nadal, a player at his most comfortable on slow clay, said he believed the blue hardcourts at Melbourne Park were considerably speedier than they have been in the past. “Completely different conditions than what I remembered of this tournament, faster conditions that I ever played here in Australia,” Nadal said, his tone indicating displeasure with the perceived change. Nadal, who played a marathon five-hour 53-minute match here against Novak Djokovic in 2012 in the longest Grand Slam final of all time, expressed confusion over why the Open would want to change the conditions that he believes produce the most epic and enjoyable matches. “I really don’t understand very well why they change because the last couple of years, Australian Open had amazing matching, long ones, good ones for the crowd,” he said Saturday. “I don’t know why the people who decide to make the conditions that fast. I am not sure for the show is the best thing. But they decide, and I’m just a player to try to be competitive from the beginning.” Advertisement Most players disagreed with Nadal’s perception of a major shift. Djokovic, the defending men’s champion, said Sunday there was “not any major difference, anything significant that I would notice” from last year to this one. Andy Murray, a three-time finalist, echoed that sentiment a day earlier, saying conditions were “exactly the same.” The tournament director Craig Tiley told The Melbourne Age, however, that no changes have been made to the Plexicushion surface from last year, though Wilson changed its tennis balls last year to ones with a more tightly woven felt, which could allow for quicker play. Speculation that the play might be much faster here first came up during a warm-up event two weeks ago in Brisbane. The courts there are meant to mirror the conditions in Melbourne, and they played far more quickly than they had in years past. Court conditions were also quicker and slicker at the tournament last week in Sydney, allowing the grass court specialist Tsvetana Pironkova to have her best-ever week on hardcourts. She beat three top-10 players en route to her first career WTA title. When word first reached Nadal that conditions in Australia were believed to be quicker, he responded with mock indignation. I thought Craig Tiley was a good friend,” he deadpanned. Maria Sharapova, who reached the semifinals in Brisbane, said that she played there on “one of the fastest courts we’ve played on in a really long time,” but that courts in Melbourne were “a bit slower.” “I’m not sure why there’s not more consistency in terms of all the events having the same speed,” said Sharapova, the No. 2 seed at the Open, which begins Monday. “I guess it is what it is.” While playing in the faster conditions of Brisbane, Roger Federer bemoaned that no matter how the balls were changed, the gritty courts in Melbourne would fluff up the felt on the balls. Advertisement “You can speed up the balls as much as you want, they’re going to be so fuzzed up after two games that it’s just going to be hard to hit winners and service winners,” he said. “If that’s what people want to see, just rallies, rallies, rallies all the time, then it’s good to have a slow court. If you want a bit more even ground for everybody, even the lower-ranked guys and more danger for the top guys, you go with a faster court. Maybe we’ll get more serve-and-volley back into the game or more of the unknown, which I think is nice.” Federer, the No. 6 seed at the Open, also pointed out that conditions in the late rounds in Melbourne were altered by having the semifinal and final rounds played at night, which he said had “slowed down conditions drastically over time.” The semifinals first moved to night sessions in 2000, and the first men’s night final was in 2005. “I think it’s quite incredible how things have slowed down over the years,“ Federer said of the tour in general. “I remember when I came up on tour with Lleyton things were so different,” he said, referring to Lleyton Hewitt, who turned pro in 1998, the same year as Federer. “We had to change our games around to be able to still compete today.” Murray offered a different critique of the newly renovated Margaret Court Arena besides the speed of the surface. Having practiced on it earlier that day, Murray determined that the court was “on a very big slope.” “The court is like that,” he said, tilting his arm to indicate alpine conditions. “It’s weird.” A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2014, in The International New York Times.

Business   Tepid U.S. Sales Are a Drag on Volkswagen’s Ambitions. Advertisement Advertisement By JACLYN TROPJAN. 13, 2014 DETROIT — Volkswagen has outlined ambitious plans to become the world’s top-selling automaker within the next four years, but its lackluster sales in the United States have been a significant drag on meeting that goal. On Monday at the North American International Auto Show, the German automaker showed that it had no intention of scaling back those ambitions, announcing that it would bring new models to the United States and invest $7 billion in North American production. Volkswagen hopes the new models will bolster its lagging sales and help it reach its goal of selling a million Volkswagen and Audi brand vehicles in the United States by 2018. A day earlier, Martin Winterkorn, chairman of Volkswagen, said the company would invest the money over the next five years to produce a midsize sport utility vehicle for the American market and increase its dealer network. The United States market is crucial to helping Volkswagen achieve its goal to sell 10 million vehicles a year worldwide by 2018, but sales for its Volkswagen brand fell 6.9 percent last year, though the company got a lift from Audi, whose sales rose 13.5 percent. Advertisement Volkswagen, Kia and Volvo were the only three mainstream brands to post sales declines in 2013. Industry wide sales surged 7.6 percent for the year as consumer confidence rebounded and new models unleashed pent-up demand. The American market “is the second-largest new vehicle market globally and a core part of VW’s strategy to become the No. 1 automaker in the world,” said Tom Libby, an analyst with IHS automotive. “The company needs to regain the momentum and growth it had here prior to 2013.” Volkswagen trails Toyota and General Motors in worldwide sales. “Volkswagen needs both a compact and midsize S.U.V. here as soon as possible,” Mr. Libby said. The midsize seven-seat sport utility vehicle Volkswagen is building for the United States market will not go on sale until 2016. The automaker has not said where it plans to build the vehicle. At its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., the United Automobile Workers union has sought to organize the workers. On Monday, VW introduced two variations on its Golf compact car — a seventh-generation Golf R, which will go on sale in early 2015, and an eGolf electric car, which was first shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. Michael Horn, incoming chief executive and president of the Volkswagen Group of America, on stage next to the Golf R, called it the highlight of the show. “I’ve got it at home in Germany in my garage.” But the new Golf models are unlikely to appeal to a broad enough market to lift sales by much, said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book. “While the Golf R and eGolf are exciting, it’s the full 2015 Golf line that will provide VW with the most significant boost in the near term,” Mr. Gutierrez said. “Golf sales were down significantly this year as most consumers interested in a Golf or GTI were delaying their purchase until the intro of the new generation which should launch early this year.” Advertisement Sales of the Golf, Volkswagen’s third most popular car after the Jetta compact and the Passat sedan, fell 24 percent last year to 30,931 vehicles. Production on the new Golf starts on Tuesday, in Puebla, Mexico, and will go on sale this summer. The weak spot in Volkswagen’s lineup, Mr. Gutierrez said, is lack of a more affordable and fuel-efficient update for the Tiguan sport utility vehicle. “This segment is growing and VW has failed to keep pace due to a high price point and fuel economy well below the industry average,” he said. The automaker will most likely get help from the Audi Q3 entry-level crossover it introduced in Detroit this week. Sales of luxury crossover utility vehicles are one of the strongest segments of the car market, rising 12.2 percent last year to outpace most of the industry, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Foreign   In Our Pages: January 15. Advertisement   BRUSSELS — Brussels was thrown into great excitement to-day [Jan. 14] by a tragic event that happened in the courtyard of the house belonging to the Corporation of Fishmongers. Some days ago a traveling menagerie arrived in Brussels and attracted great attention by its enormous elephant. A boy of 17, who was employed at the menagerie, was in the habit of teazing the elephant by twisting his tail. The elephant never remonstrated with the boy and submitted to all his pranks with extraordinary patience. This morning the boy threw a bucketful of water over the elephant’s head. The weather was cold, and the elephant lost its temper. The pachydermatous, with one whisk of its trunk, seized the boy by the right ankle and whirled him twice over his head and then dashed him against the wall. Death was instantaneous. 1914: Assassination Attempt Fails  PARIS — General Sherif Pasha, formerly Turkish Minister in Stockholm, leader of the Ottoman Liberal Party,  was saved by his son-in-law from assassination at the hands of a Young Turk emissary in his apartment in Paris, yesterday.

Science   Over the Side With Old Scientific Tenets. Advertisement Advertisement Dennis Overbye OUT THERE JAN. 14, 2014 Here are some concepts you might consider tossing out with the Christmas wrappings as you get started on the new year: human nature, cause and effect, the theory of everything, free will and evidence-based medicine. Those are only a few of the shibboleths, pillars of modern thought or delusions — take your choice — that appear in a new compendium of essays by 166 (and counting) deep thinkers, scientists, writers, blowhards (again, take your choice) as answers to the question: What scientific idea is ready for retirement? The discussion is posted at edge.org. Take a look. No matter who you are, you are bound to find something that will drive you crazy. John Brockman, the literary agent and provocateur who presides over intellectual bar fights at Edge, his online salon, has been posing questions like this one since 1998. The questions have included what you believe but can’t prove, how the Internet is changing everything, and what you’ve changed your mind about. “It’s really the same thing every time,” Mr. Brockman said over the phone, explaining that this year’s question had arisen at a conference on the social sciences last summer and immediately engendered a debate about whether it was suitable for the Edge forum. Mr. Brockman’s contributors, many of whom are his clients, are a rambunctious lot who are unified by little more than a passion for ideas and the love of a good fight. (He represents several New York Times writers, although not this one.) Some are boldface names in the pop-science firmament, like Freeman Dyson, the mathematician and futurist at the Institute for Advanced Study; Steven Pinker, the best-selling linguist from Harvard; Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist and best-selling atheist from Oxford University; and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who invented the notion of flow, or being completely lost in what you are doing, and who says scientists need to let go of the idea that the truths they find are good for all time and place. “Some are indeed true,” Dr. Csikszentmihalyi says, “but others depend on so many initial conditions that they straddle the boundary between reality and fiction.” That thought was echoed by Alan Alda, the actor and science popularizer who criticizes the idea that things are either true or false, a staple of logic and math. Sometimes context matters. Advertisement Take death, which seems a pretty definitive state. “The body is just a lump,” Mr. Alda says. “Life is gone. But if you step back a bit, the body is actually in a transitional phase while it slowly turns into compost — capable of living in another way.” Frank Wilczek of M.I.T., a Nobel Prize winner in physics, would retire the distinction between mind and matter, a bedrock notion, at least in the West, since the time of Descartes. We know a lot more about matter and atoms now, Dr. Wilczek says, and about the brain. Matter, he says, “can dance in intricate, dynamic patterns; it can exploit environmental resources, to self-organize and export entropy.” We can teach it to play chess. But don’t get too excited. Roger Schank, a computer scientist and psychologist for the nonprofit group Engines for Education, says that a chess-playing computer won’t tell us anything about how or why humans play chess nor will it get interested in a new game when it gets bored. We should abolish the term “artificial intelligence,” he says, adding: “There really is no need to create artificial humans anyway. We have enough real ones already.” Stewart Brand, founder of the “Whole Earth Catalog,” among many things, wants to talk about nuclear power, which he argues has been hampered by the unprovable notion that no level of radiation, no matter how low, is safe. As a result, billions of extra dollars have been spent to provide “meaningless levels of safety” around nuclear power plants — meaningless because our cells contain mechanisms for repairing radiation damage to DNA and because, moreover, “we all die.” Professor Dawkins and Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychologist from Northeastern University, both attack the concept of essentialism, which holds that things like dogs and cats, triangles and trees, space and time, emotions and thoughts — all have an underlying essence that makes them what they are. This works great in math, Professor Dawkins argues, but is a disaster when applied to species or politics, disallowing the possibility of change or gradation. “Florida must go either wholly Republican or wholly Democrat — all 25 Electoral College votes — even though the popular vote is a dead heat,” he complains. (The number is now 29.) “But states should not be seen as essentially red or blue: they are mixtures in various proportions.” Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., claims we could get along just fine without the notion of infinity. The computer scientist W. Daniel Hillis of the technology company Applied Minds claims we can get along without the notion of cause and effect, which he says is just an artifact of our brains’ penchant for storytelling. Seth Lloyd, a computer scientist at M.I.T., says it’s time to lose the notion of a universe. Yes, nothing is sacred. Take evidence-based medicine, all the rage in the new age of health care. Gary Klein, a psychologist for the company MacroCognition, says the idea can impede medical progress by discouraging doctors from trying alternative treatments that have not been blessed by randomized controlled trials. He points out, for example, that many patients suffer from more conditions than experiments can control for. Advertisement Ian McEwan, the novelist, attacks this year’s question itself. Retire nothing, he says; science needs to hang onto its traditions and ideas. “Aristotle ranged over the whole of human knowledge and was wrong about much,” he says. “But his invention of zoology alone was priceless. Would you cast him aside? You never know when you might need an old idea.” The whole thing runs more than 120,000 words. You can dip into it anywhere and be maddened, confused or stirred. If there is an overall point, it is that there is no such thing as a stupid question. The true currency of science, after all, is not faith or even truth, but doubt. It’s hard to imagine a similar effort coming out of the College of Cardinals or the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. In science, as in democracy, everything has to be up for grabs. When the scientists and other intellectuals stop squabbling, then we will know we are in trouble.

Business   Consumers Can Check on Data Beyond Their Credit Reports. Advertisement Advertisement By ANN CARRNSJAN. 15, 2014 You most likely know the drill when it comes to the importance of checking the accuracy of your credit report, which lenders review before deciding to make a loan or issue a credit card. Federal law allows you to get a free copy of it once a year. But there are dozens of other companies that gather consumer data for narrower purposes, and they are also required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act to give you access to your report annually. They might gather information about your employment history, your medical conditions or your track record as a renter. Two companies may be relevant here. The Work Number, a service of Equifax Workforce Solutions, verifies job and income information for many big employers, lenders and government agencies. MIB Group, formerly known as the Medical Information Bureau, helps insurance companies with underwriting for consumers seeking life, disability or long-term care insurance, and similar types of coverage. I recently submitted annual disclosure requests to both companies, to see what sort of information they might have on me. The process was simple and relatively quick. In both cases, I received a written response in the mail in less than the two weeks suggested on the companies’ websites as typical response times. That could be because both had little information about me. Or it could be, in part, because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently prodded specialty companies to make sure they have easy-to-navigate systems for giving consumers timely access to disclosures. The Work Number verification service was created to help employers manage requests to confirm salary and employment information — for example, to verify a worker’s pay when he or she applies for a mortgage. Equifax Workforce Solutions, also known as the TALX Corporation, obtains its data directly from its employer clients, which it says number nearly 3,000, including most of the Fortune 500. Advertisement The Work Number’s clients provide data on employment, payroll and sometimes benefits, which is then made available, for a fee, to banks, employers and others authorized to receive it. Equifax says it provides information only to those with a legitimate reason to have it, and requires anyone seeking information on someone to obtain that person’s permission before it is released. My employment data report from The Work Number, which I requested by mail, included information about a prior employer. It listed my start and end dates; my biweekly salary; and the date and size of my last pay increase. It all looked correct — so any prospective employer checking my work history would have accurate information. Advertisement My disclosure from MIB, however, contained nothing at all. I requested my disclosure online, and received a letter a few days later stating simply that “MIB does not have a consumer file about you.” Why might that be? If you have never applied for insurance that required individual underwriting, or if it has been more than seven years since you applied, the bureau will not have any information on you. (Underwriting is the review process insurers conduct to determine if you are a good risk, and it can affect whether they offer you coverage and what your premiums are.) MIB is a cooperative that serves 450 insurance companies, providing them information to help evaluate people applying for individually underwritten insurance policies (as opposed to group policies, which usually do not require individual review). Member insurers report information to MIB, and other member insurers can get access to that data, with your permission (you generally give it when signing your application). MIB says its service can alert insurers to information — say, a condition like obesity, a bad driving record or even risky hobbies — that you may have “intentionally or inadvertently” neglected to report on an insurance application. An MIB spokesman, David Aronson, said the data-sharing helped keep insurance rates affordable by weeding out fraud. If MIB has a file on you, the disclosure letter would describe what information it contained — say, an indication of high blood pressure or diabetes — and which insurer provided it, Mr. Aronson said. MIB says it does not retain actual medical records, like X-rays or lab reports; rather, it uses proprietary codes to describe medical conditions. The conditions may flag a possible problem if they do not match up with what was said on an application. Insurers cannot deny you coverage or raise your premiums based on such information alone, he said, but must do their own investigation to confirm it. Here are some questions to consider when seeking annual disclosures: Q. How can I determine which companies might have information about me — and whether I’ve found them all? Advertisement A. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau maintains a list of these so-called specialty consumer reporting companies. More than 40 companies are on the list, although it’s not all-inclusive. “There’s no definitive list, so it’s kind of amorphous,” said Chi Chi Wu, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. The list, which groups the companies into categories, is a good start — but it may not be worth your time to contact all of them. The bureau advises, however, that you may want to check with “some or all” of the companies if you have been a victim of identity theft. Other situations in which you might want to check with a company include those in which you are applying for insurance or a lease on an apartment, or in which you have applied for a new job and your potential employer asks for authorization to seek a background report. Q. When should I request a disclosure from the specialty consumer reporting companies, and how do I do it? A. In general, it makes sense to request the reports if you think the information a specific company maintains may be relevant to your situation. Unlike with credit reports, there is not one central website where you can request annual reports from the specialty providers; you must apply to each company. Many provide one free report annually, although some can charge a small fee. Q. What sort of information do I need to provide when requesting a report? A. In general, be prepared to submit your name, date of birth and Social Security number; MIB also asks for information about your place of birth. The Work Number requests additional documentation when a request is submitted by mail, such as a copy of a driver’s license and a utility bill. (If your current employer is a client of The Work Number, you can usually obtain your report online at theworknumber.com.) Q. What if my report contains mistakes? A. You have the right to dispute inaccurate information, and the disclosure letter typically tells you what to do. If you are unhappy with the company’s response, you can complain to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Congo: Fighters Quit, U.N. Says. Advertisement Advertisement By SOMINI SENGUPTAJAN. 14, 2014 The head of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Tuesday that 8,000 fighters affiliated with a variety of armed factions had surrendered since the M23 rebel group was routed in November. Among them are the Hutu militias that Rwanda holds responsible for the genocide 20 years ago. Martin Kobler, the United Nations’ special representative for Congo, said about 50 members of a Hutu group, Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, had surrendered in each of the last two months alone, steadily diminishing what he said was a 1,800-strong force. He said his peacekeepers were focused on rooting out the rest, but warned that the group was not likely to be eliminated by military means alone.

Science   Shoring Up Those Fitness Resolutions Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement January is the cruelest month, at least for those with good intentions to get fit. According to recent analyses of decades’ worth of exercise studies, many new exercise “intenders” will abandon their workout routines within two weeks of their New Year’s resolutions, and about half will quit by June. Even longtime exercisers feel the pull of physical entropy. In any given year, around a quarter of the people who had been working out dutifully will stop. (And about 2 percent of those who claim to have no intention of exercising actually start and continue, baffling researchers and possibly the exercisers themselves.) Why we fail to realize our best exercise intentions is a complex interplay of psychology, physiology and genetics. Adult twins frequently have similar exercise patterns, suggesting that some portion of exercise motivation is inherited. Innate personality also plays a role, according to one of the new reviews published last fall in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Being extroverted makes it easier to stick with exercise resolutions, while being nice (or “agreeable,” in psychological terms) does not. But most quit exercising for more commonplace — and redressable — reasons. For instance, people make generic or unrealistic plans about where and when they will exercise, making them essentially fairy-tale wishes, says Ryan Rhodes, a professor of behavioral medicine at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, who has co-written several recent reviews and conducted numerous exercise-intention experiments. “Someone can plan to go to the gym Friday at 5:30 a.m. before work,” he says, but if he or she hates early rising or prebreakfast exertion, those plans will evaporate. What Dr. Rhodes describes as a “far more detailed strategy” that concretely addresses specific obstacles (Which bus runs at 5:30 a.m.? Gym bag packed and next to the door?) is more likely to motivate behavior. Also gauge “your daily fatigue and schedule exercise during times when you feel best,” he advises. But the most important factor when it comes to sticking with exercise is so obvious that it frequently goes unheeded. The appeals of physical fitness — good health, pleasing appearance, appropriate body weight — are vague and distant, and “the actual experience of exercise is not given much consideration,” Dr. Rhodes says. In other words, we don’t think about whether we like exercise before we embark on a regimen, yet our feelings about exercise predict “who translates their intentions into behavior,” as Dr. Rhodes puts it. So the first consideration is finding your exercise bliss. Typically this includes variety, novelty and competence. People who feel ungainly in a Zumba class won’t keep attending. Rewards, furthermore, are of limited value. Promise yourself an hour of television after 30 minutes of walking through the neighborhood, and the walk can seem more pleasurable. But naked greed is not much of a motivator. In a study published last year in Preventive Medicine, 117 college freshmen agreed to visit their school’s gym on a regular schedule. Some were then paid at least $10 weekly if they complied. After four months, the for-profit exercisers had visited the facility more times in total than the other students, but only 63 percent met the original agreed-upon goals, and everyone’s attendance had fallen off week by week. Even for the notoriously impecunious, cash cannot overcome lack of interest.

Travel   How to Choose an Air Travel Search Site. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 15, 2014 Which airline booking sites offer the cheapest airfares? If your answer was Expedia — or any of the other dozens of online travel agencies — you’re wrong. If it was “They’re all the same,” you’re definitely wrong. “It’s so overwhelming, I have no idea”? You’re getting close. The real solution is finding the sites that best fit your specific travel needs — all the more true for the heavily budget-conscious. Each has different strengths offered through different interfaces that use different functions and produce different results. But where to go for what? Even for people like me who live on these sites, it’s not always clear. So I designed a test — from Europe, as it turned out, where I was reporting on the road. I selected 15 online travel agencies, from the old stalwarts like Travelocity to an excellent (and increasingly robust) group of upstarts like Routehappy, which are more likely to take into account niche specifics like seat pitch. Then I put them through the wringer, shopping for six itineraries, from basic domestic to overseas-only to elaborately multicity: Miami-Chicago, Louisville-Portland, Los Angeles-Paris, Dallas-Singapore, Shanghai-Chengdu in China and, finally, New York-Guadalajara-Bogotá-Charlotte (presumably a Mexican-Colombian-American visiting family and the Nascar Hall of Fame). I should note that I couldn’t include every site in my tests, and left out a popular one I couldn’t figure out how to use abroad: Bing Travel. As I learned too late from a spokeswoman, it only works in the United States. There’s a workaround — you can switch settings to “tailor” your search to “the United States — English,” But that’s one extra hassle I wasn’t willing to take on. That said, the results? For one, my eyes hurt. But more important, I created what I hope is a useful (though not definitive) guide to which sites work best under which circumstances. Advertisement If Cheap Is All That Matters The sites you’ve certainly heard of — Travelocity, Expedia, Kayak, Orbitz — were all dependably similar, their lowest offerings rarely differing more than a few dollars. But the upstarts occasionally beat them. For that Miami-Chicago flight, the old guard circled around $378. But Routehappy found one for $361, and I followed it through to just before the final click, and it was legit. (Momondo gets an honorable mention at $364.) So the best technique here is to check one of the traditional sites, and then play around with the new guys and see if they can pull an upset. Then, before you book, check the airline’s own website to make sure it’s not even cheaper there. (And don’t forget that Southwest — by its own choice — doesn’t show up on most sites.) And as long as you’ve popped over, it’s almost always a good idea to do the actual booking from the airline’s site: It’s often easier — and rarely harder — to take care of the minutiae (entering your awards number, choosing seats and paying for extra luggage, as well as changing your reservation down the line if necessary). When You Want Cheap — Within Limits Sometimes the sites think more like soulless machines than like humans. On occasion they’ll list a $400 flight with a 12-hour layover before a $401 flight with a 90-minute layover — not a choice most travelers would make. Just ask it to sort by trip length, you say? Then that $401 flight might disappear under an avalanche of $9,999 flights with 89-minute layovers. O.K., that’s an exaggeration, but it’s a real issue: Even cheapskates will sometimes pay $50 to shave six hours off a layover. That’s when you turn to sites like Hipmunk, where the default setting orders the flights by “agony,” dropping flights with long layovers or sky-high prices down the list. This worked especially well with that Dallas-Singapore route, where, after a great deal of sorting on Expedia and Travelocity, I finally decided the cheapest tolerable flight was $1,174, with a total trip time of 25 hours, 10 minutes out and 23 hours, 42 minutes back. When I tried the same search on Hipmunk, it put that precise itinerary right at the top. Routehappy’s algorithm includes other factors you might be willing to pay more for, including seat space and electrical outlets; their top choice (without changing the default preferences) was a $1,555 Korean Air itinerary with an extra three inches and three fewer hours. Worth it? That’s up to you. If You’re Booking a Domestic Route on Short Notice Priceline’s opaque bidding system works well with hotels — I’ve often saved 30 to 50 percent on hotels by placing an absurdly low bid and allowing the site to charge my card before it told me exactly which hotel I was paying for. Savings are less and more rare on flights, but do exist, particularly on domestic flights booked just a few days in advance. Savings top out at about 40 percent, so try bidding 10 or 20 percent below the cheapest standard fare. If your bid fails, no problem: Book through Priceline’s regular service, which fared as well as other big-name sites on my tests. Two caveats: You can choose the date but not the departure time of your flight (or the airline), and you might be stuck with an annoying layover. But other than advance planning, I don’t know a better way to shave dollars off a standard domestic ticket. When Your Dates or Destination Are Flexible Most of the bigger sites (notable exception: Expedia) offer to find you cheaper flights if you’re willing to fly one to three days earlier or later. That was a nice innovation in 2010, but these days their systems seem inflexible, and the resulting grids dizzying. Much better are the far more intuitive bar graphs you get on Momondo and Google Flight Explorer. There’s also GetGoing, which will give you a discount if you give it two destinations you like and let it pick one. And at Adioso, one of the newer sites in my survey, you start by just typing in your starting point and destination, and mold preferences from there. That won’t work for Thanksgiving visits to family, though, and the results can be hit or miss. (The company is promising lots of improvements in 2014.) If You Have Commitment Issues For a few bucks, Options Away will hold your reservation for between a day and a few weeks. That’s great if, for example, you need to coordinate plans with others. Two problems: It only works on domestic flights within a limited list of cities, and its base rates are not always competitive. On that Miami-Chicago route, the site’s best base price was $400, versus the standard $378 I found everywhere else. So in that case, the $10 premium you pay to hold your ticket for a week is actually more like $32 if you end up buying it. When You Need a Complex, Multi-Leg Route Not every site allows multi-leg itineraries. Of those that do, I used to recommend Vayama for multi-leg, international searches. But when it came time to test my New York-Guadalajara-Bogotá-Charlotte route, its “Multi Cities” function flunked on two attempts, issuing a “We’re sorry, Vayama could not find any matching flights” message. Meanwhile, Expedia and Orbitz didn’t bat an eye, spitting out multiple quality choices as easily as if I had asked to book the New York-Washington shuttle. The best options were packages for about $1,040 adding up to about 30 hours of travel time. Travelocity did too, but only after I finally found the multi-leg function hidden in “Advanced Search Options”; Hipmunk and Momondo wasted my time with flights that disappeared when I went to book them; and Kayak simply overwhelmed me with too many options, forcing me to click through page after page of near-identical offerings to find something different (and their filters barely helped). Advertisement If Your Trip Starts and Ends Outside North America or Europe This one gets tricky. American and European sites often can’t find cheap fares on regional carriers elsewhere in the world. So start elsewhere. Googling or asking foreign friends is a good start; they might lead you to sites like Brazil’s Submarino Viagens (alas, not in English) and China’s Ctrip (sometimes buggy). That’s where I began my Shanghai-Chengdu search, finding a $253 nonstop using Shanghai Airlines out and Air China back. When the site kept demanding a phone number that I had already given, an online chat representative helped me with a workaround so I could book; of course, I could have also gone to the airlines’ sites. As expected, the regulars mostly bombed: The best deals on Expedia, Travelocity, and Orbitz topped $500; Hipmunk and Cheapoair were over $400. But then a surprise: Kayak and Momondo unearthed a $233 flight on Spring Airlines, a low-cost carrier that Ctrip left out. I was sent to the airline’s site to book, but it worked smoothly. Quite an upset, but don’t count on that happening every time. When You’re Pressed for Time For those who want to book an entire trip — flight, hotel, car rental — in one place, the traditional sites will definitely save you time. But if you’re focused just on flights, there are other considerations. Most straightforward is the amount of time it takes each site to process your searches. The clear winner there is Google Flights (a different offering from Google Flight Explorer), with shockingly instantaneous results — you’d almost think they’d invented the modern search engine. But it occasionally costs you time while booking. They’re not alone in forcing you to other sites to book, but only on Google did I sometimes have to re-enter my search details once transferred. (In one case it even told me to call a travel agent!) For a Better Online Experience Some sites are particularly pleasant to use, in both superficial and substantive ways: Hipmunk’s graphic displays of flights and layovers; Kayak’s input simplicity; Momondo’s clear presentation of great information about options. Losers here were Cheapoair, for frequently kicking me off to a results page before I had completed my search (I must have continuously hit some shortcut key accidentally, but it didn’t happen anywhere else) and Travelocity, which has an unpleasant interface. One strike against Momondo: I was often directed to European booking sites, which charged me in euros, forcing me to seek out conversion rates and making me nervous about whether my own card would give me the same rate. (Some cards, though not mine, also charge for international transactions.) See More » Go to Home Page »

Washington   Snowden to Join Board of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Advertisement Advertisement By CHARLIE SAVAGEJAN. 14, 2014 Washington — Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor whose leaks of secret documents set off a national and global debate about government spying, is joining the board of a nonprofit organization co-founded by Daniel Ellsberg, the well-known leaker of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War. The announcement by the group, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, is the latest contribution to a public relations tug of war between Mr. Snowden’s critics, who portray him as a criminal and a traitor, and his supporters, who say he is a whistle-blower and source for the news media in the tradition of Mr. Ellsberg. The foundation’s board already includes two of the journalists Mr. Snowden gave N.S.A. documents to, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. But the organization — which consulted with lawyers about whether adding Mr. Snowden to its board could jeopardize its nonprofit tax status — is trying to emphasize parallels between Mr. Snowden and Mr. Ellsberg. In 1971, the Nixon administration charged Mr. Ellsberg with violating the Espionage Act because he gave the Pentagon Papers, a classified history of decision-making about the Vietnam War, to The New York Times and other newspapers. A court eventually threw out the case for government misconduct. Mr. Snowden has been charged under that same law. “He is no more of a traitor than I am, and I am not a traitor,” Mr. Ellsberg said in an interview. He added that he was proud that Mr. Snowden would serve alongside him on the group’s board, calling Mr. Snowden a hero who “has done more for our Constitution in terms of the Fourth and First Amendment” than anyone else Mr. Ellsberg knows. Advertisement The announcement comes days after the top Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee sought to paint a far more sinister portrait of Mr. Snowden, saying he had aligned himself with America’s enemies and jeopardized national security. They cited a classified defense intelligence report they said concluded that most of the documents he took concerned military activities rather than civil liberties. “Make no mistake, Snowden is no patriot and there is no way to excuse the irreparable harm he caused to America and her allies, and continues to cause,” said the chairman, Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan. He added that Mr. Snowden’s “real acts of betrayal” were “likely to have lethal consequences for our troops in the field.” Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer advising Mr. Snowden, called such criticism “exaggerated national security fears” that amounted to “an attack on the journalists who have published the stories based on the documents.” He added. “The government said much more dire things about what would happen if The New York Times published the Pentagon Papers. None of them turned out to be true.” In a statement provided by the foundation, Mr. Snowden said he was honored to serve the cause of a free press “alongside extraordinary Americans like Daniel Ellsberg.” Because Mr. Snowden is living in Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum, he will participate in board meetings by a remote link, according to the group’s director, Trevor Timm. Mr. Timm said that before offering Mr. Snowden a position, the group consulted with lawyers about whether doing so could create legal problems. The Internal Revenue Service recently granted the group nonprofit status under a section of the tax code that allows donors to deduct contributions from their taxable income, he said. The lawyers, he said, concluded that Mr. Snowden’s participation as a board member — an unpaid position — should not jeopardize that status because the I.R.S. has not penalized other groups with board members under indictment. Rather, such tax status is generally put at risk when groups stray from their mission. Mr. Timm said that the foundation’s mission was to encourage “news organizations to publish government secrets in the public interest and for brave whistle-blowers to come forward, even though it is personally very risky.” He added: “Snowden embodies exactly what we started this organization for, so I think we’re pretty safe.” Advertisement The foundation was started 14 months ago for the initial purpose of enabling donations to WikiLeaks after firms like PayPal, MasterCard, and Visa began refusing to process contributions. It rapidly expanded into other activities, including raising funds for other organizations and hiring a stenographer to produce daily transcripts of the court-martial trial of Chelsea Manning, then known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, WikiLeaks’ main source. It raised about $650,000 last year, Mr. Timm said, of which about $500,000 went to various other organizations, including about $200,000 to WikiLeaks. The group is increasingly focused on helping journalists protect the security of their communications, including by disseminating and managing a free software system to enable would-be sources to send leaked files to journalists in a way it says can evade surveillance. “Journalism isn’t possible unless reporters and their sources can safely communicate, and where laws can’t protect that, technology can,” Mr. Snowden said in his statement. “This is a hard problem, but not an unsolvable one, and I look forward to using my experience to help find a solution.” A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2014, on page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Snowden Joins Board of Press Group Founded by Daniel Ellsberg.

Business   What’s in a Name? The Equus Bass770. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 16, 2014 DETROIT — Equus is Latin for horse. It’s also English for a certain Hyundai model, but don’t tell that to Equus Automotive. Michael Qualid, a spokesman for the company, said that Equus didn’t know the name had been in use on Hyundai’s premier luxury model when Equus opened in 2006, but he expressed hope that the Korean automaker would not come after a niche marque over its name. The Equus Bass770, a retro muscle car on display in a corner of the Detroit auto show, is not a ’67 or ’68 Ford Mustang fastback, but it looks exactly like one. Even the interior, filled with modern necessities such as high seat backs and air bags, features a look that brings its viewer into a leather-wrapped 1960s muscle-car cave. But even though it has the same profile and many of the same body creases as the Mustang, all similarities end there. The Equus is nearly 10 inches longer, about 5 inches wider and 3 inches taller than the Mustang made famous by the “Bullitt” chase scene. That’s because the car’s aluminum frame and carbon-fiber and aluminum body are, although assembled to look like an old Mustang, made from scratch, Mr. Qualid said. It also has a General Motors engine under its long hood. The car’s front clip looks like it came from the early ‘70s Mopar playbook. The tail lights could have been adapted from a late ‘60s Camaro. Equus does say in its sales brochure that the Bass770 was “born of an abiding passion for genuine 1960s and 1970s muscle cars,” so it’s good to know that all three Detroit automakers appear to have been represented in some manner, if only vestigially. The cars are built in Rochester Hills, Mich. Equus engineers placed the car’s 640-horsepower LS9 supercharged 6.2-liter V8 (used in the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1) as far back as possible, to improve weight distribution and to create a long energy absorption zone forward of the engine. If you’ve ever looked beneath the hood of a ’68 Mustang, there’s some room between the radiator and the grille, but in the Equus interpretation, there’s a lot of space there, because the engine lives pretty far aft in a slight divot in the firewall. Equus says the Bass770 meets federal motor vehicle safety certification standards. Mr. Qualid said that by having a small passenger compartment within a long body, it was possible to incorporate big crumple zones into the design. As for its emissions certification, he said that Equus had not received it yet, but that since the LS9 is already a certified engine, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem for the company. He also said that Equus is working toward getting European safety and emissions certifications for the car. Advertisement The cars Equus brought to Detroit this week — one red, another white and the other blue – looked good. But there were a few little details the boutique automaker may want to address before attempting to sell a $250,000 sports coupe. For example, the rear decklid on the white car didn’t look as if it fit perfectly. On the dashboard of the red car, I believe I saw some slight wrinkles and uneven stitching in the leather that in a Ferrari of similar price, you would never, ever see. Mr. Qualid said that Equus hoped to sell 100 cars in the first year of production; perhaps as many as 200 a year later on. Although the company’s name could be a potential legal issue with Hyundai, Mr. Qualid said that Equus had not been contacted about it. Jim Trainor, a spokesman from Hyundai, said he was “very familiar” with the Equus Bass770, but declined to comment on the Equus name. The Equus logo seems safe from legal attack, though. Like the Mustang’s logo, it’s a horse, but unlike the Mustang’s logo, the image is not a profile of a horse in full gallop. Nor is the horse prancing, like the one in the Ferrari logo. The Equus horse assumes a stance vaguely similar to the Lamborghini bulls. But instead of having its head lowered, preparing to charge, the Equus horse appears to be rearing back, as if spooked. The model name is a bit nebulous. Ian James, a spokesman for Equus, said in a telephone interview that the 770 stands for the volume, in cubic centimeters, of each of the engine’s eight cylinders. But as for the Bass — as in the musical instrument, not the fish — part of it Mr. James said was simply a name the company had settled upon when it decided to build the car. Go to Home Page »
Foreign   Military Opens Investigation Into Photos of Dead Iraqi Militants. Advertisement Advertisement By ASHLEY SOUTHALLJAN. 16, 2014 The United States military said it had begun an inquiry after photographs that appeared to show Marines burning the dead bodies of Iraqi militants appeared on a gossip website. The photos were obtained by the website, TMZ.com, which published some of them online on Wednesday. TMZ said the photos were shot in Falluja sometime in 2004. Two of the photos posted on Wednesday show a man in a Marine’s uniform pouring liquid from a gasoline can on two decaying bodies. Two other photos show the bodies on fire, and two more show the charred remains. In one photo a man poses on one knee with his rifle pointed toward a human skeleton. In another, a man is running his hands through the pants pockets of one of the bodies. TMZ said the pictures showed more than a dozen bodies. The site posted eight of 41 pictures, withholding the rest because it said they were “too gruesome.” TMZ said it turned over all the photographs to the Department of Defense last week. The website did not say when or how it obtained them. Navy Cmdr. Bill Speaks confirmed in an email that the Marine Corps was investigating. “We are aware of photos appearing on TMZ.com that depict individuals in U.S. Marine uniforms burning what appear to be human remains,” he said. “The actions depicted in these photos are not what we expect from our service members, nor do they represent the honorable and professional service of the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.” Advertisement Commander Speaks added that the Marines were “investigating the veracity of the photos, circumstances involved, and if possible, the identities of the service members involved. The findings from this investigation will determine whether we are able to move forward with any investigation into possible wrongdoing.” TMZ also reported that the United States Central Command, which runs military operations in the Middle East, said that the photographs had not been previously brought to its attention. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, mishandling human remains in a war zone is a crime for which there is no statute of limitations. However, if those involved are now private citizens, the military would have to recall them to active duty to face charges, a potentially complex legal procedure. Falluja, in Iraq’s Anbar Province, was the site of a November 2004 battle where about 100 Marines died. In recent weeks, the city has fallen into the hands of Sunni insurgents, some backed by Al Qaeda, who have raised their black insurgent flag over government buildings. A year ago, a video that showed Marines urinating on the bodies of dead Afghans threatened to upend delicate talks among the United States, the Afghan government and the Taliban. A Marine involved in that episode, which officials said occurred in 2011, pleaded guilty in December 2012, and was sentenced to a reduction in rank and a forfeiture of $500 in pay. The Marine, Staff Sgt. Joseph Chamblin, said he had no regrets and that he would do it again as revenge for the deaths of American service members. Go to Home Page »
Home   Just for You, Blue. Advertisement Advertisement On Location By ELAINE LOUIE JAN. 15, 2014 What do you do when you love bright color but don’t want to be overwhelmed by it? Hire a designer who works almost entirely in white. It sounds counterintuitive, but it made sense to Rhonda Weinman, 55, a financial planner with a house on Long Island who asked her friend Peri Wolfman to design an apartment on the Upper West Side. Years ago, Ms. Wolfman and her husband, Charles Gold, owned Wolfman-Gold and Good Company, one of the first stores in SoHo to carry tableware in just one color: white. Later, she was the tableware designer for Restoration Hardware, where much of what she produced was white. Her own homes and most of the furnishings are white; even her clothing is primarily white. As she put it, “I’m allergic to color.” None of that worried Ms. Weinman, who rents the 500-square-foot studio for $3,500 a month to use as a weekend pied-à-terre. She’s a pro, Ms. Weinman thought. She’ll do what the client wants. But when Ms. Weinman told her friend that what she wanted was an apartment decorated in one of her favorite colors, which happen to be fuchsia, purple and turquoise, it was almost a deal-breaker. Advertisement Fuchsia and purple were out of the question. “But I like turquoise,” Ms. Wolfman said. “So I took a deep breath and said, ‘For you, Rhonda, I can do turquoise.’ ” Ms. Wolfman painted just two areas of the studio that color — the front door and the walls surrounding the sleeping area — so the bed appears to be in a turquoise room of its own. All the other walls are white, and so are the ceilings. “The ceiling couldn’t be turquoise,” Ms. Wolfman said. “It would have been oppressive.” To soften the color, she added pale gray furniture. And in the kitchen, she hung a huge, dark gray aluminum clock. “I like things oversized in a small apartment,” she said. “It makes it feel like a bigger space.” Ms. Wolfman, who was given an $18,000 budget, finished within a month, from paint and furniture to flatware and bedding, shopping mostly at CB2, West Elm, Wisteria.com and Restoration Hardware. And in September, Ms. Weinman moved in. Since then, she has spent nearly every weekend at the apartment. She considers it a personalized version of the hotel rooms where she used to stay when she came to the city. It even has a safe, in a corner of the closet. But now, if she moves, Ms. Weinman knows she can take the décor with her. Everything except the turquoise walls.

Science   Think Like a Doctor: A School of Red Herrings Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. The Challenge: Can you figure out what is wrong with a 29-year-old former volleyball player who develops some odd aches and pains and a swollen foot? Every month the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to take on a difficult case and offer their solutions to a diagnostic riddle. This month’s case revolves around an athletic and previously healthy 29-year-old woman who developed a pain in her groin, a swollen foot and ankle and a slew of lab abnormalities. We will provide you with many of the notes and tests from the many doctors who saw this patient. The first reader to provide the correct test to make the diagnosis gets a signed copy of my book “Every Patient Tells a Story” and the satisfaction of unraveling a tough tough case. The Patient’s Story: “Is your blood pressure always this high?” Dr. Becky Miller asked the young woman who had come to see her. Until recently it had been fine, the slender 29-year-old told her. It was kind of crazy because she’d been healthy her whole life, the young woman continued. But these past several months she’d been seeing doctors almost weekly, and it seemed like every time anyone checked, her blood pressure was high. Dr. Miller was the newest specialist the young woman had been sent to since her ordeal began eight months earlier. It started innocuously enough. She’d enrolled in a new Pilates class and somehow injured her left hip. As a high school athlete and, briefly, a professional volleyball player, she knew the ache of a pulled groin muscle, but this felt worse — a lot worse. Walking hurt, even sitting hurt; exercise was impossible. She asked around and found an orthopedic surgeon in her Los Angeles neighborhood. He diagnosed her with a grade 2 sprain in her groin muscles and sent her for physical therapy. That didn’t help. Then several weeks in, with her hip still bothering her, her left foot and ankle swelled up. A Long List of Doctors: The young woman went to her primary care doctor. He was the first to take note of her elevated blood pressure. Let’s keep an eye on that, he told her. He wasn’t much concerned with the swelling; she should just take it easy and use compression stockings when she needed them. That didn’t sit right with her. She felt like this was more than just the pulled muscle, so she went to her endocrinologist. He had helped her a couple of years earlier when she’d had irregular periods. Back then he figured out that she had too much of a hormone known as prolactin, which was messing up her menstrual cycle. An M.R.I. of her brain showed a tiny spot on her pituitary gland, the likely cause of the excess hormone. He put her on a medication called bromocriptine to block the prolactin and her periods improved, though they were still irregular. The endocrinologist wasn’t sure what had caused her swollen foot. He ordered an ultrasound to look for a clot in that leg, but no clot was found. He ordered a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to see whether something might be getting in the way of the blood flowing back into her heart. No obstruction was found, but the scan did reveal that her spleen was somewhat enlarged. The endocrinologist sent her to a G.I. specialist, who scoped her. He saw some gastritis, but nothing that would cause a big spleen. However, a blood test revealed that she had too many red blood cells — an unusual finding, especially in a young woman who was still menstruating. So he sent her up the street to Dr. Becky Miller, a hematologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Patient’s History: When the patient walked into Dr. Miller’s cheerful waiting room that morning, the first thing she noticed was that she was the youngest patient in the office by a good 20 to 30 years. That scared her a little. Still, Dr. Miller’s cheerful manner and brightly colored crocs put her at ease. The doctor led her to a couple of armchairs in the middle of a homey office, and she launched into her by now well-rehearsed story about her symptoms, doctors and tests. Dr. Miller paid close attention, nodding and jotting down notes in the pad on her lap. When the doctor examined her, she seemed quite surprised by the high blood pressure reading. The patient was quite tall, 5-foot-10, and slender, 150 pounds, with an athletic build. No, she told the doctor, she’d never had high blood pressure until her doctor had noticed it earlier that year. The young woman looked quite healthy. She had a couple of tattoos on her back and arm. And some tenderness in the upper left quarter of the abdomen, where her spleen was located. Her left ankle was still a little swollen. The rest of her exam was normal. Some Unusual Lab Results: Dr. Miller had already reviewed the lab test results obtained by the gastroenterologist; they showed that the patient had a hematocrit of 50. Normal, for a woman, is usually up to 40. The labs sent to Dr. Miller can be seen here.   Dr. Miller first considered causes of the patient’s elevated hematocrit and enlarged spleen. She was worried that this was some type of cancer. Could this be polycythemia vera, an abnormal proliferation of red blood cells? Or was this leukemia? She sent blood off to be tested for these illnesses, and when the results came back negative, she sent the patient for a bone marrow biopsy. She was reassured when that was unrevealing as well, so she turned her focus to the other medical issue: the patient’s relatively new high blood pressure. You can see Dr. Miller’s note here.   Looking for a Cause of High Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is certainly common. One out of three Americans have it, and for well over 90 percent of them, no cause will be found — a condition called essential hypertension. Many of these individuals will need lifelong drug treatment along with a low-salt diet and regular exercise to prevent complications from their disease. However, in 5 to 10 percent of cases, high blood pressure has an underlying and, more importantly, treatable cause. Address the cause, and the high blood pressure will usually resolve. The trick is to identify those few who have high blood pressure as a symptom of another problem from the many who have essential hypertension. This patient was at increased risk for hypertension — her father had it. Still, could some medical problem be causing her blood pressure to rise? And if so, was it also linked to her swollen ankle and high red blood cell count? The doctor started the patient on an antihypertensive medication, lisinopril, and began looking for something that could have made this young woman’s blood pressure rise. Was there a diagnosis that could make all these symptoms make sense? Feeling the Pressure: Medications are the by far most common cause of an elevated blood pressure. Many everyday over-the-counter drugs, including painkillers like ibuprofen or decongestants like Sudafed, can raise blood pressure. So can alcohol or stimulants like caffeine, nicotine or cocaine. Ordinary prescription drugs like antidepressants, Ritalin or birth control pills can too. But this patient told Dr. Miller that she took none of those drugs, rarely drank alcohol and never smoked. In children, the most common cause of high blood pressure is a narrowing, or coarctation, of the aorta. If the condition is not found in childhood, it will continue to cause high blood pressure in adults. A difference in blood pressure between the left and right arm can suggest this problem. This patient’s blood pressure was the same in both arms. Another treatable cause of high blood pressure is narrowing of the smaller arteries leading to the kidneys, but a CT scan of the abdomen showed normal vessels. You can see the report of the CT scan here.   Finally, some diseases cause excess secretion of body chemicals like thyroid hormone, adrenaline or cortisol that can raise blood pressure. The hematologist sent off tests looking for any of these, and when several came back abnormal, Dr. Miller sent the patient back to her endocrinologist. You can see the results of the testing that Dr. Miller ordered here.   The endocrinologist ordered several tests to try to figure out what was going on. One of them was quite revealing. Solving the Mystery: Now I ask you, gentle reader, if you could order only one test to figure out what was wrong with this patient, which test would you order to lead you most rapidly to the right diagnosis? And what is the correct diagnosis? I’ll post the answer tomorrow.    Join in the discussion.    Rules and Regulations: Post your responses in the comments section.

Sports   In Wilting Heat, Sharapova Escapes 2nd Round. Advertisement Advertisement By GREG BISHOPJAN. 16, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — As her match dragged more than three hours, Maria Sharapova stomped and grunted and stole glances at her box. Her face twisted into grimaces. She seemed happiest on changeovers, underneath the shade of an umbrella, an ice vest draped over the back of her neck. So much appeared stacked against her: temperatures that climbed to 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) and forced Australian Open officials to invoke their “extreme heat policy” and shut down play on the outside courts; a serve that turned shaky with a series of double faults; and an opponent, Karin Knapp of Italy, who played a fearless brand of tennis, as if buoyed by the heat. Sharapova botched three match points earlier in the third set, as momentum swung in Knapp’s direction. Inside Rod Laver Arena, the air felt thick, heavy, even with the roof partially closed to provide shade. Programs became makeshift fans. Empty water bottles filled trash cans. To say it was hot was to say there was tennis — two obvious assertions. Knapp slung winners from the baseline, hitting harder, her shots more daring the later the match went. Sharapova fought. She fought through three doubles faults. She fought through temperatures that turned Melbourne Park into tennis’s Mojave Desert. She fought until ahead late in the third set, when Knapp sent a backhand long and their contest ended, finally, mercifully, the tally 6-3, 4-6, 10-8. Sharapova advanced to the third round. So many questions lingered afterward. They centered on whether the match should have been finished at all under such sauna-like conditions. The participants were not so sure — and clearly not that happy. Advertisement “There is no getting around the fact that the conditions were extremely difficult, and have been for the last few days,” Sharapova said. Sharapova took the most issue with the uncertainty involved. She noted that players do not know at what temperature matches will be stopped — because there is no exact temperature but rather the discretion of the tournament referee. She said she received her first weather-related notification from tournament officials after her match, while she was in an ice bath. She also said she did not want to complain, and that she never considered on court whether the temperatures were too high, the conditions too dangerous. She thought only about winning, surviving, making it through to the next round. Knapp was asked the same questions afterward. “Maybe they should change some rules,” she said. “Because it’s not the same like playing under the roof. It was really tough.” Their match lasted for three hours and 28 minutes. But while the third set continued without an end in sight, the Open announced the implementation of its extreme heat policy. It was the third day a heat wave here that had resulted in lowered attendance; caused one player to faint on court and another player to vomit; and left one participant, Ivan Dodig of Croatia, to say Wednesday “I was thinking I could die here” after cramps forced him to retire from a singles match. When the policy went into effect, it meant that no matches were played on the outside courts until 6 p.m. local time, a break of four hours. Play continued at Rod Laver and Hisense arenas, where the roofs were closed. None of that helped Sharapova, her face the picture of agony. The chair umpire warned Sharapova for taking too long on her serve, and the third seed shot an icy glare in the umpire’s direction. Both players tried to step into the shade behind the baselines between points until the next serve. Whenever Sharapova seemed to take control, Knapp countered. She stepped into her groundstrokes, took the ball early, sent flat backhands into corners to force Sharapova to give chase. Advertisement Sharapova eventually recovered. She ripped a forehand winner down the line to break Knapp at 8-8. The crowd stood and cheered and reached for the closest nearby beverage. “I had to play, and I had to finish the match and do it the best I can,” Sharapova said. “It’s not the best conditions, but I don’t want to complain.” When it ended, Sharapova pumped both fists and walked toward the net. She did not look happy so much as she looked relieved. Next up: air conditioning and sleep. Go to Home Page »
Technology   Milestones in Marissa Mayer’s Tenure as Yahoo’s C.E.O.. Advertisement Advertisement As Yahoo’s chief executive, Ms. Mayer has acquired more than 20 companies, but is now facing a spinoff of the company’s core business in an attempt to rejuvenate the once-dominant Internet giant. UPDATED April 15, 2016 Yahoo and its chief executive abolish the company's work-at-home policy in an effort to reinvigorate the once-dominant Internet pioneer. The move is seen as a reaction by a company in crisis mode, and is immediately met with criticism. “This isn’t a broad industry view on working from home,” according to a statement from the company. “This is about what is right for Yahoo right now.” The company doubles the time new parents are allowed to take off, an olive branch after receiving negative attention for revamping its work-at-home policy. Ms. Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, has said that attracting talented workers is crucial for the company’s turnaround. Since arriving at Yahoo, Ms. Mayer has increased the amount of perks employees receive, including handing out smartphones and free lunches in the company cafeteria. Days after the company unveiled the second redesign of its mail service under Ms. Mayer's leadership, thousands of users express their displeasure with the changes. Several groups form online, advocating to change it back. With an estimated 275 million users, Yahoo used to be the most popular email service in the United States. But it has been surpassed in recent years by Google’s Gmail service and Microsoft’s Hotmail offering. Yahoo users suspect the new Yahoo Mail was the company's unsuccessful attempt to mimic Gmail, which Ms. Mayer had a hand in overseeing while she worked at Google. Looking to further restore the company's diminished profile, Ms. Mayer hires Katie Couric to be the "global anchor" for Yahoo, a role that is likely to include interviewing major newsmakers as well as an expansion of the company's news operations. "We both speak the same language and share the same sensibilities," Ms. Couric says of Ms. Mayer. A prominent activist investor, the hedge fund Starboard Value, urges Yahoo to forgo a plan to spin off its stake in Alibaba and instead sell its core business. Starboard argues that the reason for spinning off the Alibaba stake — avoiding taxes while raising money for shareholders — appears to have evaporated after the Internal Revenue Service declined to provide any guidance about the tax liability related to the spinoff. Yahoo drops a plan to spin off its $31 billion stake in Alibaba. Instead, the company will spin off all of its other assets, including its stake in Yahoo Japan, into a new company. After spinning off the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, Ms. Mayer had planned to focus on improving the company’s core business, the sale of advertising that is shown to the roughly one billion users of Yahoo’s apps and websites. Ms. Mayer is effectively back to square one in her attempts to turn around the beleaguered Internet giant.

Business   Sharing Web Links Without Cutting and Pasting. Advertisement Advertisement Q&A By J. D. BIERSDORFER JAN. 17, 2014 Q. Is there an easier way to email a web page link on the Nexus 7 than copying and pasting the link from the browser into the mail app? A. If you are using the standard Chrome browser that comes with the Android operating system on the Nexus 7, go to the page URL you want to send. Tap the icon on the far-right side of the menu bar; the icon looks like a vertical stack of three dots. When the menu opens, tap Share. On the Share menu, you can do multiple things with the URL for the open web page, like posting it to a Twitter, Google Plus or Facebook account, or sending it to another device over a wireless Bluetooth connection. Or easily paste the link into the body of an email by tapping either Gmail or Email — whichever mail program you use on the tablet — on the list of sharing options. A new message will pop open with the link in the body. You just need to enter an address in the To field and add any explanatory text necessary in the body of the message. Other Android-compatible browsers most likely have a similar menu or button for sharing web page links by mail. If you are using Dolphin or another browser on your tablet, check the browser window for a sharing menu or icon. Preparing for the End of Windows XP Q. I’m not sure if my hardware can handle an upgrade from Windows XP to a newer version of Windows. What are my options once Microsoft kills off Windows XP this spring? Advertisement A. As Microsoft has been reminding its customers for many months, support for its Windows XP operating system ends on April 8. (The company has a site dedicated to getting people off its outdated, insecure Internet Explorer 6 browser as well.) While your Windows XP computer will continue to run, Microsoft will not be providing security updates and other patches to keep the system safer from viruses and other malware attacks. The company also announced that it would not be providing an XP-compatible version of its Microsoft Security Essentials software on its site, either. Microsoft has two suggestions for those still using Windows XP: upgrade the operating system or buy a new PC. The system requirements for Windows 8.1, the latest operating system, may be a little high for older hardware. You need a machine with at least a 1-gigahertz processor, 1 gigabyte of memory, 16 gigabytes of hard drive space and a graphics card compatible with DirectX9 and the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) software. Microsoft’s site has a tutorial on potentially upgrading from Windows XP, including links to an upgrade assistant program that checks your current machine to see if it can run Windows 8.1. You can check to see if your older programs work on Windows 8.1 on the Compatibility Center page. If neither of these options sounds appealing or possible, you have other choices. You can continue on with Windows XP with third-party security software, although you may find fewer sites, services and programs that continue to work with an operating system that was first released in 2001. Although it may take some heavy lifting and expertise, some people have found extended life for old hardware by installing the open-source Linux operating system, which tends to have less-intensive system requirements than other operating systems. The jump to Linux may not be for everyone, especially those with the need to run Windows-only programs, but you can still use word-processing programs, browse the web, handle email and work with unrestricted digital photo, video and music files. Some Linux distributions like Ubuntu (which has a guide to switching from Windows) and Linux Mint are popular and relatively user-friendly. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   What They Said: Rahul Gandhi’s Speech at Congress Executive Meeting. Advertisement   NEW DELHI – In an unusually passionate speech at the Indian National Congress’s national meeting on Friday, Rahul Gandhi praised the governing party as the defenders of the people’s will and criticized the main opposition as being undemocratic. Breaking from his usual calm demeanor, Mr. Gandhi accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of “subverting democratic institutions” and “lighting the fires of communal hatred.” In an apparent jibe at Narendra Modi, the B.J.P.’s prime ministerial candidate, Mr. Gandhi said, “We do not respond by proposing either that the structures of democracy be handed over to one man or that they be viciously destroyed.” His speech came after the decision by his mother, Sonia Gandhi, president of the Congress Party, to keep to the party’s tradition of not naming a prime ministerial candidate before the elections. Instead, Mr. Gandhi, the Congress vice-president, will head the party’s campaign committee for the elections. As Mr. Gandhi stepped up to address hundreds of workers at the party’s one-day national executive meeting, he was greeted by a thundering clamor. However, even as shouts of “Rahul P.M.! Rahul P.M.!” went up, Mr. Gandhi, the scion of the powerful Gandhi family demurred. “It is written in the constitution that the prime minister is elected by the members of Parliament. We are a democratic party and we function in a democratic way,” said Mr. Gandhi. Here are some of the responses to Mr. Gandhi’s speech: Inder Malhotra, political commentator:  “His pitch was very fierce and high. Part of the purpose was because the Congress rank and file are very demoralized. They expect defeat in the elections. This is a kind of a pep talk for them, to say that there is a battle ahead but the battle is not lost. The second purpose is that though he is not officially designated as the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress Party, there is not the least bit of doubt that if the Congress Party is able to muster a narrow majority, the prime minister is Rahul Gandhi. If they do not, he can be the leader of opposition.” Neerja Chowdhury, senior journalist and political analyst:  “The speech was a different, more confident Rahul Gandhi, passionate, and he laid out a vision for the Congress Party. He gave an indication that he will now be in the lead. The Congress is now entering the Rahul phase; even the decision was made not to project him as the prime ministerial candidate for strategic reasons. There was a time when he had appeal for the younger generation, but somewhere he lost the plot on the way, and A.A.P. [Aam Aadmi Party] and Narendra Modi stepped into the vacuum in leadership. One reason he has not clicked is that he is an on-and-off politician. He would have an intensive phase of campaigning and engagement with the party, then he would disappear. Now he is saying he is here to stay, and if he really lives up to that, then it will remain to be seen how things change for Congress. What he was doing today at the A.I.C.C. [All India Congress Committee] session was to energize the worker of the Congress because it has been a very demotivated party of late.” Arun Jaitley, leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha and senior B.J.P. leader, via Twitter:  “In 25 years, a Gandhi has not been the PM of this country. India, indeed, is changing. The Gandhis can control a party but not the nation.” Sanjay Kaul, B.J.P. Delhi spokesman:  “The Congress Party has known that Rahul Gandhi holds no capital anymore. Everyone is this country knows that. At no point has he looked as a leader. And by all estimates, the Congress is in no position to win the elections. The Gandhi family are not risk-takers and they do not lead from the front. They have used people as their props. The Congress Party has also been an exhibition for how they cut leaders to size in their respective states.” Girish Kuber, editor at Loksatta, a Marathi-language newspaper:  “He is playing to the typical ploy that every Indian politician employs, what has been called the politics of renunciation. He is taking the family tradition a step further because when Sonia Gandhi was sure that she will not get the chance to rule the country, she has talked about the inner voice. And now he is making these vague statements. Now the real issue is if Congress loses. This will be a real test for Rahul Gandhi. He will only emerge as a real leader in 2019. Projecting Rahul Gandhi as the prime minister did not make sense for the Congress. In fact, it helps Congress save Rahul for the real battle in 2019. That is Congress’s strategy.” Malavika Vyawahare contributed reporting. India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Orange Is the New Green Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking. Orange is the color of the week in my kitchen, as it has been since the fall and will be throughout the winter at my farmers’ market. I’m making oven fries with sweet potatoes, roasting and simmering carrots and winter squash with seasonings I haven’t used before with these vegetables and finding new ways to enjoy grated carrot salads, which have always been a weakness of mine. Sometimes markets can look bleak in winter, but there’s nothing drab about carrots, sweet potatoes and winter squash; I’m finding that there is a lot I can do with these nutrient-dense vegetables. Nutrient-dense they are. In a recent study published by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, investigators looked at the relationship between cardiovascular disease and the colors of fruits and vegetables consumed. The question that the designers of the study were asking was whether the color of fruits and vegetables, which reflect the presence of bioactive compounds, can be associated with protection against cardiovascular disease. Their conclusion was that a high intake of all four color groups — green, orange, red and white — and especially red and orange fruits and vegetables may be protective against cardiovascular disease. There is a lot that researchers are still uncovering about the compounds in orange vegetables. We do know that the pigments reflect the presence of beta-carotene, and not surprisingly, all three of these vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin A. They are very good to excellent sources of vitamins C and K, as well as very good sources of potassium and manganese. We know they are excellent sources of other phytonutrients that show some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, like lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene. And those are just the ones we are familiar with; there are plenty that are still under study in these delicious vegetables.

Sports   N.F.L. Conference Championship Matchups. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN HOFFMANJAN. 17, 2014 Patriots at Broncos 3 p.m. Sunday, CBS Line: Broncos by 6 In Tom Brady’s first start in the N.F.L., he defeated Peyton Manning. Brady has continued to be a thorn in Manning’s side, compiling a sparkling 10-4 record (2-1 in the postseason) against him. The gesticulating Manning now leads the record-setting Denver offense, but like so many of his past teams, this one is overhyped because of a great offense masking a mediocre defense. It would be surprising for Brady to break a sweat about this game. One key to Brady’s confidence, other than his good looks, his large bank account, his Hall of Fame-worthy career and his supermodel wife, is the sudden emergence of a dominant New England running game. LeGarrette Blount, known mostly for ending his career at Oregon prematurely by punching an opponent, has become the type of runner that Patriots offenses have frequently lacked. In Week 17, the 6-foot, 250-pound Blount ran for 189 yards and 2 touchdowns against the overmatched Buffalo Bills. In a divisional playoff win over the Indianapolis Colts, Blount showed his success was no fluke, rushing for 166 yards and 4 touchdowns. He did not rush more than 14 times in a game until Week 16, but over the last three games he has averaged 6.7 yards a carry, gaining much of his yardage on hard runs between the tackles. That type of production, aided by a competent second running back in Stevan Ridley, takes the pressure off Brady, who was sacked 40 times this season. If given time to throw, Brady has shown he can work with the pint-size Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola as his main receiving threats. They may not make anyone forget the physicality of Rob Gronkowski, but they have consistently gotten the job done for New England. The last time Brady and Manning met for the A.F.C. championship, in the 2006 season, Manning and the Colts won in Indianapolis. Now Manning and the Broncos are favored because their offense has been loaded since Day 1 and the Patriots have had to cobble one together. Advertisement The game is in Denver, and New England has been a mediocre road team. In almost every way, it looks like a season to remember for Manning and one to forget for Brady. But Brady has been here before and relishes the chance to be an underdog. “I’m sure no one’s going to pick us to win,” Brady told reporters. He was wrong. Pick: Patriots   49ers at Seahawks 6:30 p.m. Sunday, Fox Line: Seahawks by 4 San Francisco’s NaVorro Bowman is a legitimate contender for defensive player of the year, and he can also find the essence of a game in a few words. “Long story short: They know us, we know them,” Bowman said of the rival Seahawks. “We got to go there. We all know the history. But this is the Super Bowl.” Either the Broncos or the Patriots will make an interesting Super Bowl opponent, but in a face-off reminiscent of the great 49ers-Cowboys postseason matchups of the early 1990s, the two most complete teams in the N.F.L. will be playing for the N.F.C. championship. The similarities between the 49ers and Seahawks have been noted time and again: bruising running backs, suffocating defenses, brash head coaches. Recent history has favored whichever team is at home. With that in mind, playing in Seattle is a large hurdle for San Francisco to overcome. In their last two meetings there, the Seahawks have beaten the 49ers by a combined score of 71-16. San Francisco has come a long way since a Week 2 thrashing by the Seahawks. The 49ers closed the regular season with six consecutive wins before winning two road games in the playoffs. Finally playing at full strength, with receiver Michael Crabtree showing that he was the missing piece of the puzzle, the 49ers are undoubtedly eager to change their luck in Seattle. Advertisement The main question mark will be Colin Kaepernick’s ability to manage the game at the line of scrimmage. With a remarkable combination of size, strength and quickness, Kaepernick can be among the game’s most dangerous players. But he continually runs the play clock down while making adjustments, regularly burning timeouts or incurring delay-of-game penalties. That problem grows worse in Seattle, where the fans are extremely loud and know when to raise the noise level. The N.F.L. rules do not protect read-option quarterbacks the way they do drop-back passers, so the odds are that neither Kaepernick nor his Seahawks counterpart Russell Wilson will do as much damage on the ground as they did in last year’s playoffs. With all other things being equal, as they seem to be, Kaepernick’s problems in getting plays off could prove to be the difference in the game. Pick: Seahawks Times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line. A version of this article appears in print on January 19, 2014, on page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: N.F.L. Conference Championship Matchups.

U.S.   Obama’s Changes to Government Surveillance. Advertisement Advertisement By JOSH KELLER, ALICIA PARLAPIANO, DAVID E. SANGER and CHARLIE SAVAGE JAN. 17, 2014 President Obama announced on Friday that he will place new limits on intelligence agencies’ bulk collection of phone call records. But he rejected some other recommendations to rein in surveillance made by a panel of outside advisers. Related Article Documents released in June reveal that the N.S.A. has been systematically collecting logs of every Americans’ phone calls and storing the data for five years. Agency analysts may examine call records of people up to three links (or “hops”) removed from any number for which they decide there is “reasonable, articulable suspicion” of ties to terrorism. Mr. Obama says he wants to find a way not to have the government collect records in bulk, but rather keep them in private hands. In the meantime, analysts will now be able to examine only records of people two hops away from a suspect number. And the N.S.A. must obtain a court order ahead of time from a judge who agrees that the standard of suspicion has been met, with an exception for after-the-fact court review in a fast-moving exigency. There are two options for doing this. One is to require each telecommunications provider to retain its customers’ calling records for a certain time and store the data in a way that the government could quickly get access it – and cross-reference it with other providers’ records. The other is to create a private consortium that would comingle the records. Mr. Obama says there are difficulties with both options, and has directed his administration to study options and work with Congress to come up with a solution. Mr. Obama has rejected the idea of scrapping the program entirely, as some lawmakers and civil libertarians have called for, saying he wants to retain its capabilities but restructure it to reduce the possibility of abuses. Aides said Mr. Obama would like to get the N.S.A. out of the business of holding the data at all, so it was deemed to make little sense to order the agency to purge the data more quickly. That leaves open the question of how long telecommunications providers or a consortium would be required to retain the records. Mr. Obama said he would ask the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to come up with ideas for additional restrictions on government’s ability to retain, search and use the communications of Americans that were “incidentally” collected without a warrant. National Security Letters are subpoenas the F.B.I. can use to compel businesses to turn over a range of records about their customers, like financial transactions or data on communications, while gagging the recipients from talking about them. The F.B.I. uses the device tens of thousands of times a year, and it objected to losing the power to issues them unless a court approved. Mr. Obama rejected the recommendation to impose a court approval requirement. But he is ending the open-ended secrecy, saying the gag orders will expire after a fixed period in most cases. And he said providers would be allowed to say more to the public about the scope and scale of the orders they receive. Disclosures that the N.S.A. has been eavesdropping on foreign leaders, including the cellphone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, led to a diplomatic crisis for the Obama administration in October. Mr. Obama said he would generally ban the practice for “close friends and allies” and a senior administration official said this list included “dozens” of leaders of foreign countries, without specifying them. The administration did not address whether the U.S. would spy on other top officials from those countries. Recent disclosures revealed that the N.S.A. collects vast amounts of information from overseas telecommunications networks, vacuuming up metadata in bulk and intercepting the contents of communications. Mr. Obama said that new safeguards would limit the duration that the government can hold personal information about foreigners and restrict its use. While he acknowledged the United State’s responsibility to ask “tough questions” about its technological capabilities, he made clear that foreigners overseas do not enjoy the same protections as U.S. citizens. “This is not unique to America,” he said. “Few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders.” A senior official said the advocates would be called on only in cases presenting novel and important privacy law issues. The panel would apparently not have the authority to monitor the court’s caseload and independently decide when a case warranted its presence. Currently, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., selects all the judges who serve a term of extra duty on the secret court, and he has used that power to overwhelmingly pick Republican-appointed judges. Critics have called for diversifying the court by having other Supreme Court justices, or the chief judges of the appeals courts, play a role. Administration officials said that Mr. Obama would accept that kind of a change if Congress made it. In July, The New York Times reported that the N.S.A. had been collecting previously undiscovered “zero day” flaws in common computer programs and using them for mounting cyberattacks. White House says the recommendation is now under review by the security council to “review and, as necessary, adjust existing processes.’’ Documents released in September revealed that the agency had been working to weaken encryption standards so it could more easily crack secure systems. White House says its cybersecurity and science and technology offices are reviewing the issues and “we support the recommendation’s aim to protect the standards for commercial encryption.’’ In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates combined into one position the heads of the N.S.A., which is responsible for gathering intelligence, and the Cyber Command, the military's cyberwarfare unit. Mr. Obama has already rejected the recommendation to split command of the N.S.A. from the Cyber Command. The public debate over the scope of N.S.A. surveillance started when a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward J. Snowden, secretly made copies of four hard drives worth of top-secret documents and then leaked them. While Mr. Obama acknowledged Mr. Snowden’s role in starting the debate over privacy and national security, he did not address recommendations to secure classified information.
Business   ‘Bachelor’ Star’s Comments on Gays Spark Uproar. Advertisement Advertisement By BILL CARTERJAN. 18, 2014 PASADENA, Calif. — ABC faced a potential crisis on Saturday over one of its longest-running hits when a storm erupted here over homophobic comments made by the star of the reality series “The Bachelor.” In an interview at a press party, Juan Pablo Galavis, the latest bachelor tasked with picking a possible mate from among a cast of 25 beautiful women, told the editor of the website The TV Page that he was opposed to the idea of ABC producing a season of the show with a gay bachelor. Among other reasons, he said, “I don’t think it is a good example for kids to watch that on TV.” Of gay relationships, he added, “They are more pervert, in a sense.” (Mr. Galavis’s primary language is Spanish.) Mr. Galavis was among a gaggle of ABC stars who turned up for some informal conversations with reporters over cocktails Friday night at a semiannual gathering of the Television Critics Association. He spoke with Sean Daly, the editor of The TV Page, who asked for his opinion on a gay version of the popular reality series. Mr. Daly posted a recording of the interview on his site. The reaction to Mr. Galavis’s remarks was quick and intensely critical, with numerous reporters and commenters on Twitter denouncing them both as insensitive and, especially, inappropriate, given that Mr. Galavis is participating in a show that compels him to engage in romantic encounters with multiple women over a period of several weeks. ABC and the studio that produces “The Bachelor,” Warner Brothers, issued a statement on Saturday, saying, “Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio.” Mr. Galavis posted an apology on his Facebook page on Saturday. “I want to apologize to all the people I may have offended because of my comments,” he wrote. He went on to say that “I have many gay friends, and one of my closest friends, who’s like a brother, has been a constant in my life, especially during the past five months. The word ‘pervert’ was not what I meant to say, and I am very sorry about it. Everyone knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself.” Advertisement There was no mention by ABC or Warner Brothers of consequences, either for Mr. Galavis or the show. That may be because the show has ticked up in the ratings this season, with the show’s female fan base apparently smitten with Mr. Galavis, a single father and former Venezuelan soccer player. (As has been the program’s recent practice, Mr. Galavis is a former suitor on the “Bachelorette” version of the show. He was not the star’s final selection, but he warmed enough female hearts to be selected as the star of a season of “The Bachelor.”) So far this season, the show’s ratings have been up sharply from the same weeks last year. The premiere hit 8.7 million viewers, up from 6.9 million in 2013. It was a three-year high for the 12-year-old reality series. Mr. Galavis’s interview immediately sparked comparisons to the recent blowup over comments made by Phil Robertson, the patriarch of the family at the center of the A&E hit series “Duck Dynasty.” In that instance, the network reacted to what it perceived as homophobic comments by putting Mr. Robertson on indefinite suspension from the show, and then reinstated him after the show’s fans, along with some prominent conservative political voices, attacked the network for what they claimed was an assault on Mr. Robertson’s right to free speech. In the past, “The Bachelor” has openly courted — and even invented — its own controversies to drive ratings. This one seemed unexpected and spontaneous, however. ABC will undoubtedly watch closely to see how the show’s ratings are affected when it is back on the air Monday night. When “Duck Dynasty” returned this week after its own controversy, its ratings were down 28 percent. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   Turkey Extends Purge of Officials. Advertisement Advertisement By REUTERSJAN. 18, 2014 ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey has extended a purge of official institutions to the banking and telecoms regulators and state television, firing dozens of executives in moves that appear to broaden Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s response to a corruption investigation. Thousands of police officers, dozens of prosecutors and some state television officials have already been fired by Mr. Erdogan’s government, which is facing its biggest challenge with the corruption investigation. Investigators are believed to have been looking into allegations of corruption at a state-run bank and bribery involving real estate projects. Mr. Erdogan says the investigations are part of an attempted “judicial coup.” His opponents say that the purges are threatening the independence of the judiciary, the police and the media.

Sports   Serena Williams Tumbles in Australian Open’s Fourth Round. Advertisement Advertisement By GREG BISHOPJAN. 19, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — For almost a year, Serena Williams won professional tennis matches at an improbable 96 percent clip. Since her exit from the 2013 Australian Open, she had played 80 matches and had won 77 of them. As her fourth-round contest in this Australian Open wore on, though, Williams looked less and less like the most dominant player in women’s tennis. She was undone by a flurry of botched backhands, back pain and an opponent, Ana Ivanovic, who played more like a current world No. 1 than a former world No. 1. The crowd, squarely against Williams, rose to its feet and roared at the biggest upset so far in this tournament when the match ended with Ivanovic in front, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Williams smiled as she shook her opponent’s hand. Ivanovic had never beaten her — until Sunday. “It’s amazing,” Ivanovic said in her television interview on court. “I just played really well.” Over the first week of the Australian Open, Williams had accumulated records. She set the mark for most match wins in women’s singles at this tournament (61) and most women’s singles matches played (70). Advertisement All the while, she sought an even bigger milestone: an 18th Grand Slam singles championship. That would have put Williams in rare company, tied with Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second-most in history, within sight of Steffi Graf and her historic 22 titles. Instead, other numbers surfaced in defeat. Like this one: In a career filled with Grand Slam tournaments, Williams had won the first set and still lost five times in a career that started in 1995. “I made a tremendous amount of errors,” Williams said at her post-match news conference. “Shots I missed that I normally don’t miss.” Williams tried to play down her physical problems, and said she wouldn’t make excuses. However, she added: “I obviously wasn’t hitting the way I normally would hit. Or moving the way I normally would move. I know for a fact I can play so much better than what I did today. I’m not disappointed in anything. I just know I can play ten times better than I played today.” Williams cruised through the first three rounds of this Australian Open behind a succession of swift victories in which she did not drop a set. She blew off one scheduled on-court interview after her third-round victory and offered an oblique explanation that she was busy and other tasks awaited. She confirmed after Sunday’s match that she was having back pain. Whatever the reason, she looked off on Sunday, even as she fought through and took the first set. She did not bend well on the backhand side, and she did not move well, and after she missed a return early in the second set, she bent over in apparent pain. Ivanovic capitalized. Since she won the French Open in 2008, Ivanovic had mostly disappointed. Her last run to a Grand Slam quarterfinal came at the United States Open in 2012. On Sunday, she blitzed Williams from the baseline, matched Williams for serve efficiency and showcased a varied game that kept Williams on the defensive more than usual. Ivanovic dictated how the match unfolded. Advertisement On the big points that Williams won, she often screamed loudly or pumped her fist emphatically, almost as if she was trying to get herself into the match. She stole repeated glances at her box and walked gingerly between points. Williams said she almost pulled out, adding, “I mean, I probably should have.” She gave credit to Ivanovic and said: “It’s not like I gave her the match. I tried to fight the best I could today.” With Williams’s defeat, which ended a 25-match winning streak, the women’s singles draw has opened significantly. Ivanovic, seeded 14th, joined Li Na (4) and Flavia Pennetta (28) as Sunday winners now into the quarterfinals. Li, a two-time finalist, needed only 59 minutes to register a 6-2, 6-0 win over Ekaterina Makarova. Li broke No. 22 Marakova’s serve five times. In the next round, Li will play Pennetta, who beat No. 9 Angelique Kerber, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5.

Travel   Restaurant Report: Oaxen Krog & Slip in Stockholm. Advertisement Advertisement By ALEXANDER LOBRANOJAN. 17, 2014 Though Copenhagen gets most of the regional limelight, Stockholm has quietly emerged as a gastronomic destination on par with the Danish capital. One of the strongest sets of players in that mix is the chef Magnus Ek and his wife, Agneta Green, who closed Oaxen, the restaurant they’d founded in 1994 on its namesake island in the southern part of the Stockholm archipelago, and moved to a striking new water’s-edge location on Djurgarden, an island in central Stockholm, last May. Here Mr. Ek’s cuisine — an indigenous gastronomic style based on witty modern riffs on the country’s own taste palate, showcasing its best local produce — is parsed out in two different settings. At Oaxen Krog, the chef serves ambitious six- and 10-course tasting menus, while Oaxen Slip, his casual-dining restaurant next door, offers dishes like deep-fried herring with herb vinegar. “Oaxen Slip is about having a good time with friends in an easygoing environment, while at Oaxen Krog the food is intended to be the focus of the experience,” Mr. Ek said. The two restaurants have big picture windows surrounded by an industrial but well-groomed décor that intentionally nods at the former shipyard that occupied the site. These simple visuals serve as a preview to Mr. Ek’s cooking philosophy at Krog, which intends to quietly exalt his ingredients through a posture of gastronomic humility. Still, the first course of a recent 10-course tasting menu stunned with a composition suggesting the cool drama of an Ingmar Bergman film. Oysters with curds of soured milk and kohlrabi in soured whey had all of the jarring complexity of a troubled but passionate relationship. The meal tacked back to a Swedish wholesomeness with a single plump flash-fried langoustine in a cream of fermented button mushrooms with sour cream and dill. Not every dish worked — spider crab cooked with bladderwrack, a seaweed, in a seafood sauce seemed overwrought — but yogurt-roasted cod cheeks with oak moss, seaweed, cockles and black garlic cream had a haiku-like perfection. Those seafood dishes were generally more interesting than Mr. Ek’s meat ones, though a heather-roasted saddle of lamb with pickled chives, warm lamb lard and puréed leeks had an alluring rustic elegance. An article last Sunday about Oaxen Krog & Slip in Stockholm misstated the given name of the chef and owner there. He is Magnus Ek, not Markus Ek. Oaxen Krog & Slip, Beckholmsvagen 26; 46-8-551-53105; oaxen.com. Six-course menu, 1,650 kroner ($250 at 6.55 kroner to the dollar); 10-course menu, 1,950 kroner.

Business   More Monster and Hats. Advertisement Our challenge this week was suggested by Chris Roat, who calls it “one of my favorite puzzles of the year.” And Dr. Roat sees a lot of puzzles — he’s an active participant in Bay Area puzzle competitions and a longtime Google employee currently up to something top-secret at Google X. His suggestion for this week is a continuation of our recent Andrew Luck Monster Problem. Put on your headgear and get ready for — More Monster and Hats Two people find themselves stuck on a remote island. One day, a terrible monster appears. The monster says that he intends to eat the pair, but will give them the following chance to survive: Later that day, the monster will line them up face-to-face. The monster will then place either a black or white hat on each person’s head. Each person can see the hat on his or her counterpart, but cannot see his or her own hat. The monster will then ask both people at once to simultaneously guess the color of his or her own hat. The person can say only one word — either “white” or “black.” If both people are wrong, the monster will devour them on the spot; Otherwise they can go free. The two people have all afternoon to plan their strategy. The question is — what should they do? That’s it for the puzzle this week. If you’re looking for Gary Hewitt’s Enhancer to optimize your Numberplay experience, please be patient — Mr. Hewitt is revamping the tool to support The Times’s new blog format. Finally, do send your favorite hat-and-monster puzzle to gary.antonick@NYTimes.com. Solution    As some discovered, the game is 100% solvable – no randomization/guessing is needed to increase the odds of winning. It’s true even for the n colors, n people generalization. And as Daniel Finkel alludes to in the 2-hat case, the rock-solid strategy will lead to exactly one person guessing correctly. In the two-hat case, it’s easiest to explain to people that either the hats are the “same” or “different.” I find that is the paradigm shift people will have trouble with. Then the solution is deciding which of the two players will guess “same” and which will guess “different,” based on what they see. The astonishing solution, then, is to have one person always call out whatever color hat they see on the other person’s head, and that other person call out the opposite color of what they see. This will, incredibly, always allow one person to guess his or her own hat color correctly, and thereby saving both from being devoured by the terrible monster.

Foreign   Aam Aadmi Protest Shuts Down Central Delhi. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — The heart of India’s capital came to a standstill on Monday after Arvind Kejriwal, the Delhi chief minister, and members of his Aam Aadmi Party squared off with the central government in a public demonstration to demand that the Delhi police should be under state, not federal, control. As Delhi police officers barricaded the roads in central Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal also called on all residents to join him in a 10-day protest against the Delhi Police Department for failing to protect women. In a speech, he contended that the state government would be better at running the city’s police force, which he criticized as corrupt and inefficient under the central government’s administration. The standoff began early on Monday when seven lawmakers from the Aam Aadmi, or Common Man, Party, led by Mr. Kejriwal, headed out to the Home Ministry, which oversees the Delhi police, to demand the resignations of three station house officers who they said had failed to protect women in three reported cases: a gang rape of a Danish tourist, the burning of a woman over a lack of dowry and an alleged prostitution racket. However, they were prevented by the Delhi police from staging a protest in front of the ministry. The ministry, headed by Sushil Kumar Shinde, had issued a prohibitory order against the demonstration, citing a law that forbids the gathering of more than five people. The Delhi police shut down four subway stops in central Delhi and set up barricades to seal off the North Block, which houses the Home Ministry and other government offices nearby. Chaotic scenes played out as a heavy contingent of police officials surrounded Mr. Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi ministers and kept them at the railway building, known as Rail Bhavan. When the Aam Aadmi leaders realized they would not be allowed to reach the Home Ministry, Mr. Kejriwal decided to urge the public to join him at Rail Bhavan to demand that the central government hand over control of the Delhi police to the state government. In a speech, he accused Mr. Shinde of being corrupt and called on the “honest” police officials to take off their uniforms and join the side of the common man. The Aam Aadmi Party has accused the Delhi police of allowing a drug and prostitution ring allegedly run by four Ugandan woman to fester. Last week, the state’s law minister, Somnath Bharti of Aam Aadmi, demanded that the police arrest the four women during a midnight raid on their house, but the officers refused, citing the lack of a warrant and a lack of evidence. “No sex or drug racket can take place without complicity of police,” Mr. Kejriwal said. While women’s rights activists and political opponents have accused Mr. Bharti of racism, his party has backed his actions. On Monday, Mr. Kejriwal held up a letter he said was from the Uganda High Commission, stating that several girls from Uganda being brought into India on the promise of work and education were being trafficked. But Syed Akbaruddin, the External Affairs Ministry spokesman, said the Uganda High Commission denied sending any such letter. So far, the central government has refused to meet any of Mr. Kejriwal’s demands. Mr. Shinde said Monday that action would only be taken after a judicial inquiry against the three police officers was completed. He also said that security of the capital was too vital to be delegated to the Delhi government. Maxwell Pereira, former joint police commissioner in Delhi, said the chaos and sheer numbers of the Aam Aadmi demonstration were a security threat to the capital, especially in the run-up to Republic Day on Jan. 26. He also said that the chief minister was himself breaking the law by staging the protest, which has been prohibited. Mr. Kejriwal’s criticism of Mr. Shinde has put the Aam Aadmi’s coalition partner in the state government, the Congress Party, in an awkward position because the home minister is a Congress member. But though it opposed the Aam Aadmi rally, the Congress Party said Monday that it would not withdraw its support to the party. Mr. Kejriwal’s political rivals immediately criticized the Aam Aadmi Party for the disruption to the city, saying that Mr. Kejriwal should act like a statesman and stop shouting on the streets as he did when he was an anticorruption activist. “Did the AAP form a government to wreck the system from within?” Arun Jaitley, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said on Twitter, referring to Aam Aadmi. Responding to critics who called him an anarchist, Mr. Kejriwal said, “Yes, I am. Today, I will spread anarchy in the house of Mr. Shinde, the same way he has spread anarchy in our households.” The closure of the subway stations inconvenienced commuters in the morning, and the road closures snarled city traffic at night. Sibi Arasu, 26, who had been unaware of the subway closures, said it was annoying to look for alternative modes of transportation in the morning. Mr. Arasu, a media professional, said he was 20 minutes late after taking an auto-rickshaw for 40 rupees, or 65 U.S. cents,one way — a cost that could get expensive if the protests continued for 10 days, he said. In the afternoon, despite growing concerns of the Delhi police over security near government buildings, Mr. Kejriwal refused to move the protest to another location. By late afternoon, the number of Aam Aadmi members began to swell, and some began scuffling with Delhi police officers, whose numbers were also growing.The party said in a statement said that the state transport minister, Saurabh Bhardwaj, was detained and another lawmaker, Akhilesh Tripathi, was beaten up. By evening, even as it was getting colder and darker, the crowds were growing at Rail Bhavan, many to support Aam Aadmi, but about 20 were there to protest Mr. Bharti’s treatment of the Ugandan women. And as people got ready to return home from work, the city was struck by long traffic jams, prompting many taxi and auto-rickshaw passengers to get out and walk to their destinations. By 10 p.m., Mr. Kejriwal was still sitting outside Rail Bhavan, surrounded by his supporters. Betwa Sharma is a freelance journalist based in New Delhi.

Science   A Taste of My Own Manners Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Dr. Perri Klass on family health. When I started my internship, in 1986, I was given a beeper, which was handed over with a certain sense of ceremony and a certain yoke of obligation. Before cellphones were omnipresent, the beeper was a badge of professional importance: I’m a doctor — life and death depend on my instant availability. If you were talking to a patient and your beeper went off, it was understood to be a medical summons; you were entitled — and expected — to step out of the room and answer. As I went through residency and began practicing, I would never have thought of silencing my beeper when I was seeing a patient, even though I was often paged about things that were not of immediate life-or-death importance. (“Mom, I couldn’t find my social studies project this morning. Did you put it somewhere?”) Nowadays, every patient I see is just as reachable in the exam room as I am, and my reactions to their behavior with their cellphones has made me question my own attitudes toward monitoring messages and tolerating interruptions. I asked Judith Martin, who writes the Miss Manners books and columns, what the etiquette considerations are here, and she let me know in no uncertain terms that doctors themselves traded on their greater prestige in the doctor-patient relationship to create a culture that allowed rudeness — and that rudeness is now being returned. “We are reaping the punishment of doctors having used these manners when patients could not,” she said. It’s not just doctors, of course; it’s a problem outside medical settings as well, she said, with “people keeping one another waiting, ignoring those who are present in favor of taking phone calls.” Now everyone has the equivalent of a beeper, and everyone answers because, after all, it might be an emergency. In the exam room, patients routinely take calls, or at least glance at their phones. And adolescents, needless to say, can go on texting even as they’re answering a doctor’s questions. Manners, morals and medicine intersect in the doctor’s office, in a quotidian interplay of patient imperatives and medical management, politeness and professionalism, patients and patience. What are the ethics of keeping one another waiting? “These issues are hugely important to patient satisfaction, to patient compliance, to patient trust, and to physician peace of mind, or a physician’s positive attitude about work and environment,” said Arthur L. Caplan, director of the bioethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center. “But ethicists spend almost no time thinking about them.” I am not a particularly patient patient, and recently, when I went with my mother to the eye doctor, I found myself getting pretty cranky in the waiting room. After all, we had made the first morning appointment, gotten ourselves out of bed and out into the cold and across town for a 7:30 time slot. Was it possible, I wondered irritably, that the doctor hadn’t even arrived yet? And I went back to the clinic desk to ask once again, in a polite but clearly provocative way, if they knew how much longer it would be. But here is my confession: That agonizing sense of the minutes ticking past, that outraged feeling of cosmic unfairness when an early appointment is not matched by a prompt consummation, it all falls away when I’m on the other side of that clinic desk. Later that very same day, getting ready for my next patient, it made complete sense to me that first I had to read through the child’s medical record on screen — and then, yes, check my messages quickly, and then stand in the hallway and speak to a colleague for a little while — all with the patient and her mother (and the next patient and his mother) sitting in the waiting room and, well, waiting. And keeping children waiting is even more inexcusable than keeping adults waiting; children are not suited for waiting. The truth is, I was in the doctor’s time zone. And I had a feeling of hard-working entitlement that coexisted remarkably easily with the very recent memory of my own sense of outrage at being made to wait. Later that day, while I was asking a 10-year-old girl some questions about her health, her mother’s cellphone rang, with one of those loud, intrusive musical ringtones. I was neither surprised nor outraged when the mother reached into her bag, pulled out the phone and started chatting. But I suspended my conversation with the child and stared questioningly at the mother until she said, “I can’t talk now, we’re with the doctor,” and hung up. But the calls to my phone, as important as they may be to me, are not actually life-or-death patient issues, and I, too, need to turn it off. Dr. Caplan pointed out that part of providing good and professional medical care is treating people properly: “How do I cement trust in this relationship? How do we show respect for one another in a health care relationship where respect is partially an intrinsic good but also important for securing cooperation, compliance, continuity of care?” Sometimes cementing trust and showing respect actually means sitting quietly while a parent takes a phone call and arranges, for example, the pickup that will get her home after that too-long wait in the exam room. Good manners, and good morals, actually depend on getting outside the doctor’s time zone and crossing over to where everyone else lives.

Sports   Ulster Gains Top Seeding in Heineken Cup Matches. Advertisement Advertisement By HUW RICHARDSJAN. 21, 2014 London — Ulster was the big winner on the sixth and last weekend of pool matches in the Heineken Cup, rugby union’s equivalent of soccer’s Champions League. With only two places still to be claimed, the weekend was mostly about settling the seeding order which determines the quarterfinal draw. The last eight includes involves six former champions. The two yet to win currently lead the English and French championships. Ulster, the only team to have made the playoffs for the last four years, completed a pool stage sweep and secured top seeding when it won, 22-19, away to English champion Leicester. It was Leicester’s first Heineken loss at home in 25 matches and more than seven years. Ulster was already through, but heading for a tough away quarterfinal when it trailed 19-9 with 24 minutes to go. The comeback was spearheaded by its South African scrum-half Ruan Pienaar, who scored all 22 points, including the decisive penalty with 11 minutes left. A home quarterfinal at its tightly atmospheric Ravenhill Road ground also brings the chance of revenge against English club Saracens, which beat it in the quarterfinal last year. Advertisement “It seems like it’s happening every week, when Ruan scores all the points — he was outstanding,” said Ulster’s captain Johann Muller, “We came here to get a home quarterfinal. Sarries totally outplayed us last season — they are a great side and don’t mind going away to get a result.” Leicester’s loser’s prize was one of the best runner-up spots and a fearsome quarterfinal at Clermont Auvergne. Saracens claimed the other runner-up place by beating Connacht, 64-6, at Aviva Park. Its 11-try hammering of the Irish province was highlighted by two English veterans — winger Dave Strettle crossed three times while playmaker Charlie Hodgson reprised the performances he formerly produced for England, prompting brilliantly in open play but missing a series of kicks at goal. Full-back Alec Goode, one of England’s newer generation, produced the best single moment with a double feint to either side followed by a 50-meter dash to score through the space his move created. “Alec has been outstanding for the last two months, but that’s as good as it gets,” said Saracens coach Mark McCall, who added that his team’s third consecutive qualification for the playoffs “makes us a top eight side, but the next step is to be in the top two or three.” The other team to seal qualification on the final weekend was three-time champion Leinster, which hammered Ospreys, 36-3, on Friday. The contest turned on the early sending off for stamping of Ospreys lock Ian Evans. A suspension will rule Evans — who has played in every match of Wales’s consecutive championship seasons — out of some or all of the European Six Nations championship, which begins on Feb. 1. Leinster must travel, to reigning champion Toulon, in the quarterfinal. Not so compatriot Munster, which demolished Edinburgh, 38-6, to ensure a home playoff. A qualifier for the 15th time in 16 years Munster will entertain four-time winner Toulouse a quarterfinal clash of the tournament’s perennial heavyweights. Toulouse blew its own chance of a home draw when it fell well short of a four-try bonus point, crossing only once as it won, 16-6, away to Italian scrappers Zebre. France’s captain Thierry Dusautoir tore a tendon in his biceps and will miss the Six Nations. Toulouse’s failure left the way open for the French clubs who contested last year’s final to seal home draws. Toulon won, 15-9, in foul conditions away to Glasgow, while Clermont clinched its 71st victory at Stade Marcel Michelin, beating Racing Metro, 28-3. Advertisement “It wasn’t pretty,” said Clermont’s Scottish international lock forward of his team’s struggle to claim a bonus point against opponents who had three players sin-binned for illegal play. “We need to be a bit more clinical if we’re going to go further” The consolation prizes of places in the quarterfinals of the second rank Amlin Trophy went to the English trio of Northampton, Gloucester — which won, 36-18, away to Perpignan — and Harlequins, whose outside-half Ben Botica kicked a late penalty to end Wales’s vestigial European presence by beating Scarlets, 22-20, in Llanelli. The draw was also made for the semifinals, in which home teams play in their own county, but not on their usual home ground. The winner of Ulster versus Saracens will have home country advantage over the winners of Clermont versus Leicester, while Toulon or Leinster enjoy that edge over Munster or Toulouse.

The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced last August that same-sex spouses who were legally married could jointly file federal tax returns as married couples for 2013 as well as amended returns for some previous years, possibly receiving thousands of dollars in refunds. The announcement came two months after the Supreme Court struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which prevented gay couples from receiving the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples. The Times is seeking to talk to gay couples who are considering filing amended tax returns.

Science   How Inactivity Changes the Brain Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. A number of studies have shown that exercise can remodel the brain by prompting the creation of new brain cells and inducing other changes. Now it appears that inactivity, too, can remodel the brain, according to a notable new report. The study, which was conducted in rats but likely has implications for people too, the researchers say, found that being sedentary changes the shape of certain neurons in ways that significantly affect not just the brain but the heart as well. The findings may help to explain, in part, why a sedentary lifestyle is so bad for us. Until about 20 years ago, most scientists believed that the brain’s structure was fixed by adulthood, that you couldn’t create new brain cells, alter the shape of those that existed or in any other way change your mind physically after adolescence. But in the years since, neurological studies have established that the brain retains plasticity, or the capacity to be reshaped, throughout our lifetimes. Exercise appears to be particularly adept at remodeling the brain, studies showed. But little has been known about whether inactivity likewise alters the structure of the brain and, if so, what the consequences might be. So for a study recently published in The Journal of Comparative Neurology, scientists at Wayne State University School of Medicine and other institutions gathered a dozen rats. They settled half of them in cages with running wheels and let the animals run at will. Rats like running, and these animals were soon covering about three miles a day on their wheels. The other rats were housed in cages without wheels and remained sedentary. After almost three months of resting or running, the animals were injected with a special dye that colors certain neurons in the brain. In this case, the scientists wanted to mark neurons in the animals’ rostral ventrolateral medulla, an obscure portion of the brain that controls breathing and other unconscious activities central to our existence. The rostral ventrolateral medulla commands the body’s sympathetic nervous system, which among other things controls blood pressure on a minute-by-minute basis by altering blood-vessel constriction. Although most of the science related to the rostral ventrolateral medulla has been completed using animals, imaging studies in people suggest that we have the same brain region and it functions similarly. A well-regulated sympathetic nervous system correctly directs blood vessels to widen or contract as needed and blood to flow, so that you can, say, scurry away from a predator or rise from your office chair without fainting. But an overly responsive sympathetic nervous system is problematic, said Patrick Mueller, an associate professor of physiology at Wayne State University who oversaw the new study. Recent science shows that “overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system contributes to cardiovascular disease,” he said, by stimulating blood vessels to constrict too much, too little or too often, leading to high blood pressure and cardiovascular damage. The sympathetic nervous system will respond erratically and dangerously, scientists theorize, if it is receiving too many and possibly garbled messages from neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. And, as it turned out, when the scientists looked inside the brains of their rats after the animals had been active or sedentary for about 12 weeks, they found noticeable differences between the two groups in the shape of some of the neurons in that region of the brain. Using a computerized digitizing program to recreate the inside of the animals’ brains, the scientists established that the neurons in the brains of the running rats were still shaped much as they had been at the start of the study and were functioning normally. But many of the neurons in the brains of the sedentary rats had sprouted far more new tentacle-like arms known as branches. Branches connect healthy neurons into the nervous system. But these neurons now had more branches than normal neurons would have, making them more sensitive to stimuli and apt to zap scattershot messages into the nervous system. In effect, these neurons had changed in ways that made them likely to overstimulate the sympathetic nervous system, potentially increasing blood pressure and contributing to the development of heart disease. This finding is important because it adds to our understanding of how, at a cellular level, inactivity increases the risk of heart disease, Dr. Mueller said. But even more intriguing, the results underscore that inactivity can change the structure and functioning of the brain, just as activity does. Of course, rats are not people, and this is a small, short-term study. But already one takeaway is that not moving has wide-ranging physiological effects. In upcoming presentations, Dr. Mueller said, he plans to show slides of the different rat neurons and, echoing the old anti-drug message, point out that “‘this is your brain.’ And this is your brain on the couch.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/28/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: This Is Your Brain on the Couch.

Sports   Sharapova Follows Williams Out the Door. Advertisement Advertisement By BEN ROTHENBERGJAN. 20, 2014 MELBOURNE, Australia — One day after the heavy favorite Serena Williams lost to Ana Ivanovic, another multiple Grand Slam champion crashed out in the fourth round at the Australian Open. On Monday, Maria Sharapova, a four-time Grand Slam champion and the No. 3 seed, lost to No. 20 Dominika Cibulkova, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1. For Cibulkova, it was a moment of exuberance. After shaking Sharapova’s hand, she bounced back toward her player box, leaping several times and pumping her fists. Cibulkova, of Slovakia, has never been ranked in the top 10, but her victory meant that she has now reached the quarterfinals at all four Grand Slam events. Though she lost the third set fairly easily, Sharapova had given herself a good chance to win the second after falling behind, 0-5, eventually digging back to 4-5 before missing several crucial returns of second serves that allowed Cibulkova to serve out the set on her third try. Advertisement After losing the second set, Sharapova walked off the court with a trainer and received an off-court medical timeout for what she later said was a hip strain. “I mean, those aches and pains are expected when you spend a long time on the court,” she said, though she later added that knowing how such pain would have affected her movements was not “rocket science.” Cibulkova said she did not see that Sharapova was visibly affected by the injury, and added that she thought Sharapova was trying to disrupt her momentum throughout the match. “I didn’t see during the rallies,” Cibulkova said. “She was running, and, I don’t know. Of course I knew that she took the medical timeout, but she was trying to change my rhythm a lot of times during the games.” It wasn’t the first time Cibulkova had beaten Sharapova at a Grand Slam, having previously routed her, 6-0, 6-2, in the quarterfinals of the 2009 French Open. “This is, I would say, the most important thing,” Cibulkova said. “I went on the court, and I was more than 100 percent sure that I really can beat her. I can beat her on the big court, in the important match, you know, on the Grand Slam. I did it before, and I knew she knows me.” Sharapova, who had to battle in extreme heat for three and a half hours Thursday to beat Karin Knapp, 3-6, 6-4, 10-8, in their second-round match, said her ability to escape with less than her best tennis had run out. Sharapova had been forced to miss the United States Open with a shoulder injury, and had only been able to play one tournament between August and the Australian Open. “I haven’t been playing the best tennis of this tournament, but I found ways to get through to the last two matches,” she said. “I tried to do that again today, but she played extremely well.” Advertisement Cibulkova’s next opponent will be No. 11 Simona Halep. The Romanian won a marathon game at the start of the third set and eventually ran away with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-0 victory over No. 8 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. Halep, who began 2013 ranked 47th, won six titles last year, second only to the 11 won by Serena Williams. Later on Monday afternoon, in a rematch of last year’s controversy-tinged semifinal, Victoria Azarenka was rarely threatened by Sloane Stephens, beating the last American left in the tournament, 6-3, 6-2. Azarenka dominated the match from the start while Stephens struggled with consistency, and too often was not proactive enough to dictate rallies with her superior power. While both players struck 20 winners in the match, Stephens had 32 winners to 20 by Azarenka, a Belarussian. Stephens, who was defending a large number of ranking points she gained from reaching the semifinals last year, will slip from 13th to somewhere around 17th. While not as eyebrow-raising as the finish to last year’s match, which was marred by Azarenka’s taking a lengthy medical timeout after her lead in the second set began to slip away, there was little love lost between the two. Late in the first set, Azarenka pulled Stephens in toward the net with a drop shot, and Stephens landed a hard backhand passing shot between Azarenka’s legs. Three points later, after hitting another drop shot that pulled Stephens forward, Azarenka responded with a head-high reflex volley that narrowly missed Stephens, leaving the American smiling broadly as she mimed applause with her racket. Stephens, who said she had “never hit anyone in a match,” denied intentionally aiming for her opponent. “I thought she was going to move and she didn’t,” Stephens said. “I don’t know what was happening, but didn’t think that would ever happen.” Azarenka also played down the moment. “Maybe she had an open court, but she chose that shot,” she said of Stephens. “I have no problem with that.” Advertisement Azarenka, the second seed and two-time defending champion, most likely emerges as the favorite to win the tournament once again with Williams and Sharapova out of contention. “I don’t consider myself just a favorite because I don’t consider anybody as the favorite,” Azarenka said. “I just go out there and play my best, because anybody, on any given day — we’ve seen that happen last couple days — can bring their best game. You have to stay alert. It doesn’t matter the level that you’re No. 2 or whatever. Everybody has proven that anybody can beat anybody.” In the quarterfinals, Azarenka, will face Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, who defeated Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain, 6-1, 6-3.

Business   New Security Report Confirms Everyone Is Spying on Everyone. Advertisement Lest we forget, the National Security Agency is in good company. A new security report confirms that Chinese hackers spied on The New York Times in 2012, as well as attendees of the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg last fall. Iranian hackers spied on dissidents in the lead up to state elections last May. The Syrian Electronic Army is only getting better, and North Korean hackers were behind a destructive cyberattack that wiped data from South Korean banks last year. These were just some of the findings of CrowdStrike, the hot Laguna Niguel, Calif., security start-up which tracked more than 50 hacking groups last year. The company, started by George Kurtz, the antivirus company McAfee’s former chief technology officer, and Dmitri Alperovitch, McAfee’s former vice president of threat research, produced its findings in an annual report Wednesday. The report buttresses previous findings by The New York Times, Google and a number of other security firms, including FireEye, the Milpitas, Calif.-based security software firm that acquired Mandiant last year. It also offered a number of interesting new discoveries. Among them: Needless to say, this won’t be a slow year for the $67 billion cybersecurity industry. Follow Advertisement Go to Home Page »
Foreign   A Race Against Time for a Second Child. Advertisement Updated, 9:27 a.m. | At 39, Xiao Cai knows time is not on her side if she’s to fulfill her yearning and have a sibling for her 3-year-old son. Her dreams are modest; she only wants two children. Yet two months after the Chinese government announced a change to the one-child policy to permit some families a second child (the change will apply to couples where one partner is an only child), hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of women like Xiao Cai who are pushing the limit of their fertility find themselves in a bizarre and painful situation: Their dream of having two could be defeated at the finish line by the slow-turning wheels of state bureaucracy. After decades of the one-child policy, many Chinese still feel that two children is a more normal number than one. Xiao Cai, who asked to be identified only by her nickname to maintain her privacy, hopes deeply for a girl. A family of one girl and one boy — known in the West as a ‘‘millionaire’s family’’ — is an ideal here, too, like the two vases that make up the pair in traditional Chinese aesthetics. She knows that her biological clock is ticking fast. But only in Zhejiang Province and, today, in Anhui Province, has the policy become law. In mid-January, the provincial People’s Congress in Zhejiang revised the law to permit qualifying couples to apply to have a second, saying the law ‘‘has been born,’’ according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency. In Beijing, Liu Zhi, the city’s head of family planning, said officials ‘‘hope’’ to implement the change there on Mar. 1, The Beijing News reported. ‘‘The authorities have said they will change the law, but no one knows for sure when,’’ said Xiao Cai, a Beijinger and a health care worker. For now, she can only wait, as she has done since November. ‘‘I really want another baby,’’ she said. ‘‘But if we try now, what if I get pregnant and the law doesn’t change in time?’’ ‘‘I’d like to just go ahead. But if it doesn’t happen soon and I have a child, it could have really severe consequences for us,’’ she said. ‘‘If I don’t do it now, I may never be able to. I really don’t know what to do.’’ The financial consequences of breaking the law, even in its dying days, would be heavy. She has done her math: the couple could be fined 300,000 renminbi, about $50,000. It would financially ruin them. Her husband left his ‘‘iron rice bowl’’ state job some years ago to work independently. Their income is adequate, but they’re not rich. In a later text message, she wrote: ‘‘I’ve read in the newspapers that the whole country is researching this, when and how to bring it in. And I’ve read other stories that say the government is saying, don’t rush to have a second child, you must wait for the central government to announce it’s for real, or you will have problems getting all the papers you need.’’ So for now, she anxiously waits. Xiao Cai is luckier than many of her friends who she said are battling infertility, a condition she believes is growing in China, based on anecdotal evidence. She already has her son. Yet she also has an older sister with whom she is extremely close and she cherishes that sibling love. What mostly drives her, she said, was the fear that her son would feel alone. ‘‘Only one child, isn’t it lonely for him? He’s so clingy. I think it would be really good for him to have a sibling,’’ she said. So, as has been the case since 1979, when the one-child policy began, Chinese remain dependent on the will of the state for that most intimate of things: procreation. Only now, for many it’s a race against time. The government expects between one million and two million additional births per year after the law takes effect countrywide, said Mao Qun’an, a spokesperson for the National Health and Family Planning Commission. In Beijing, officials expect between 30,000 and 50,000 more births per year, The Beijing News wrote. Xiao Cai is hoping her dreamed-of daughter will be one of them — if the law changes before her fertility runs out.

Science   Potato and Sorrel Gratin. Advertisement Advertisement Recipes for Health By MARTHA ROSE SHULMAN JAN. 20, 2014 When a friend offered me sorrel from her garden I accepted gladly. I love the tangy flavor of this green leafy vegetable and will always buy it if I see it in my farmers’ market. You don’t need much to contribute lots of lemony flavor and vitamins C, A, iron, calcium and magnesium. The gratin is not a typical creamy sliced potato gratin; it’s more like a potato pie. I cook the potatoes first, then slice or dice and toss with the wilted sorrel, eggs, milk and cheese. Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes 2 pounds small or medium-size Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed Salt to taste 8 ounces sorrel, stemmed and washed in 2 changes of water 1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in half Olive oil or butter for the baking dish 4 eggs 1 1/2 cups milk (2 percent) 3 ounces Gruyère, grated (3/4 cup) 1 ounce Parmesan, grated (1/4 cup) Freshly ground pepper 1. Place potatoes in a wide saucepan and cover with water. Add salt to taste and bring water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover partially and gently boil potatoes for 20 minutes, or until tender all the way through but firm enough to slice. Drain, return the potatoes to the pan, cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Remove from the pot and using a towel to grip the potatoes if they are too hot to handle, slice about 1/2 inch thick, or if you prefer, cut in dice. Transfer to a large bowl. Advertisement 2. Meanwhile stem and wash sorrel leaves. Heat a wide skillet over high heat and add the sorrel, in batches if necessary. Stir until sorrel has wilted in the liquid left on the leaves after washing. The color will go from bright green to drab olive and the sorrel will melt down to what looks like a purée. Don’t worry, it will be chopped and mixed with the other ingredients and you won’t mind the color. When all of the sorrel has wilted, remove from heat and transfer to a strainer or a colander. Rinse briefly with cold water, then press or squeeze out excess liquid. Chop medium-fine. Transfer to bowl with the potatoes, toss together and season with salt and pepper. 3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rub sides and bottom of a 2- to 2 1/2-quart baking dish or gratin with the cut side of the garlic clove. Oil dish with olive oil. Mince remaining garlic and add to potatoes and sorrel. 4. Beat eggs in a medium bowl. Add salt to taste (I use about 1/2 teaspoon). Whisk in milk. Add to potatoes and sorrel and stir well to distribute sorrel evenly throughout the mixture. Stir in cheeses and freshly ground pepper, and scrape into the baking dish. 5. Bake 45 minutes, or until set and the top and sides are nicely browned. Remove from the heat and allow to sit for 10 minutes or longer before serving. Yield: Serves 6 to 8 Advance preparation: You can cook the potatoes and sorrel up to a day ahead. The gratin keeps well in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Reheat in a medium oven for about 20 minutes.

Business   IBM Happy to Be Rid of Low-End Server Business. Advertisement   Lenovo of China, already the world’s largest maker of personal computers, has purchased from IBM one of the world’s largest computer server businesses, for what seems like a rock-bottom price. Lenovo gets market share in an area where it is a small player. IBM is shedding a business that was killing its profitability in higher-margin software and services. Wish both sides luck. What seems something like the proverbial win-win deal is more likely a sign of how fast things are changing in the trillion-dollar global technology industry. Businesses like PCs are losing ground to mobile devices like smartphones, and the once-formidable computer server is increasingly viewed as one more commodity piece of globe-spanning cloud computing projects from a few elite players. “We need to get an inventor’s profit, not a distributor’s profit,” said Steve Mills, senior vice president of software and systems at IBM. “Our investment in research and development is what makes IBM go. It’s hard to do that in markets that don’t give you credit for the innovations you bring.” It’s stark how quickly that margin fell away. A year ago, IBM was talking about a sale of its server business to Lenovo for what was reported at the time to be $6 billion. Today’s deal for $2.3 billion kept for IBM some higher-value servers, like those that perform complex data analytics. But according to Mr. Mills, it also included agreements for IBM to buy from Lenovo some of the commodity, or x86, servers for IBM’s growing cloud business. About 7,500 IBM employees, including people in sales, marketing and customer support, will also move to Lenovo as part of the deal, Mr. Mills said. He also noted that IBM still spends $6 billion a year in research and development, from which it plans to create higher-value businesses. “The money has to go where the market goes: Social, mobile, analytics, and security,” he said. “We’ve put a lot of money there, tens of billions just buying analytics companies over the past several years. You’ll still see us doing a lot of creative things in hardware.” For its part, Lenovo moves from near invisibility in the server market to a crucial position. According to Gartner, in the third quarter of 2013 Lenovo’s global server presence was about 0.2 percent of the 2.4 million x86 servers shipped worldwide. IBM had a 7.5 percent share. Hewlett-Packard was first, with a 26.8 percent share, and Dell came second, with a 19.6 percent share. “Even in China, Lenovo has only a 10-percent share,” said Errol Rasit, an analyst with Gartner. “IBM has 11 percent. There isn’t much more efficiency Lenovo can put into the manufacture, H.P. and Dell have already been about as efficient as possible. Lenovo bought entrance into an extremely challenging market that is in transition.” Investors seem to think Lenovo’s jump into a sizable share of the market will have an effect on pricing, however. Soon after the announcement, the share prices of both Intel and AMD, the two prime suppliers of x86 chips, fell. To some degree, the counts of market share and profitability become more difficult as cloud companies like Google and Amazon Web Services design and contract their own highly engineered systems. While these custom-built devices aren’t counted by analyst firms, they may already represent a significant share of the world market. In effect, IBM may have sold off a business increasingly dominated by the cloud companies with which it must also compete as it builds out its own cloud. Last year IBM paid $2 billion for a cloud company called Softlayer, and last week said it would spend $1.2 billion just this year building out that business. Mr. Mills defended his company’s chances. “Softlayer operates at a cost point equal to Amazon,” he said. “I don’t worry about the competitive issue.” Google, he noted, has agreed to use sophisticated IBM chips in its computer centers. “We’ve had our eyes on the issue for some time,” he said.

Foreign   1924: Black Flags Fly All Over Russia To Mourn Lenin. Advertisement   MOSCOW — Lenin, the founder of Bolshevism, died this morning [Jan. 22]. After an illness lasting nearly two years, his condition became suddenly worse yesterday, and at five this morning  he lost consciousness, death following two hours later from paralysis of the nerve centres. He was fifty three years old. Kalinin, president of the Soviet Central Committee, announced the death to the Soviets to-day amid loud weeping. Lenin’s body will be brought to Moscow to-morrow and exposed for public view for three days. The death of the sick “Dictator” though long expected, has produced a tremendous sensation, superstitious Russians being impressed by its coinciding with the nineteenth anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Trotzky organised the first revolutionary movement in the Russian capital, and with the formation of Labor Government in London. A proclamation has been issued announcing that “Lenin is dead, but that the Soviet Republic will continue his work. The power of the Soviet Government is so strongly planted that even the death of Lenin cannot change this historic fact.” Although Lenin had been superseded for some time past by a triumvirate composed of Kameneff, Zinovieff and Stalin, who have also recently set aside Trotzky, the occult influence of the founder of Bolshevism continued to make itself felt, and only a few days ago it was announced that he was improving in health and had actually been out shooting crows. Nicholas Lenin, whose real name was Vladimir Oulianoff, was born at Simbirsk, on the Volga, on April 10, 1870. His father was a chinovnik or civil servant and had attained a rank which conferred nobility upon himself and his descendants. With the caution that characterized the whole of his career, Lenin managed to avoid arrest during several, years of revolutionary activity. It was in 1896 that the Okhrana finally got him, and two years later arrested his wife. They managed to escape with a light sentence. Already in 1900 both were free and able to take up their residence in Switzerland, living alternately in Zurich and Geneva. Lenin appealed to the  masses in a way that the most ignorant could understand. He informed peasants and workmen that — in the doctrines of Karl Marx — all property represented robbery and therefore they were perfectly justified and entitled to take it from its holders. That was the secret of his success in the Bolshevist revolution of December 7, 1917. Like most of his associates, Lenin looked only to the end, but to him it was power and nothing else; while the others imagined they could really introduce a new dispensation on earth. That is why Lenin was the first to counsel a compromise with Capitalism in the form of the “Nep” (New Economic Policy). — The New York Herald, European Edition, January 23, 1924  This blog will share highlights and curiosities from The International Herald Tribune's storied reportage. While we will share coverage of historic events — the world wars, the women's suffrage movement, the great expeditions — we will also republish glimpses of less earth-shaking moments and the ephemera of daily life.

Home   A Niche for Oomph. Advertisement Advertisement By RIMA SUQIJAN. 22, 2014 PIQ, a gift shop that opened last week at Grand Central Terminal, in a space formerly occupied by Pylones, is, like its predecessor, wildly colorful. But the similarities end there. “The Pylones look was about cuteness, and I was tired of cuteness,” said Frédéric A. Rambaud, a founder of the Sarut Group, which manages Pylones stores in New York (two remain) and an owner of the new PIQ. “There’s a new aspect in retail that’s a mix of day-to-day with designer toys. So the grandmother can come in and find something for the grandchildren, and at the same time find something for herself.” Depending on the grandmother’s mood and budget, such items could include sticky notes in the shape of a clock ($4.50) or a Barbie Anatomy Model, a sculpture by Jason Freeny that exposes the doll’s innards ($8,000). Intestines aside, Mr. Rambaud might be dismayed to hear that many of PIQ’s offerings are indeed “cute.” Information: 212-867-0969 or piqproducts.com.

Science   Living With Cancer: Life of the Party Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. The prospect of a party frightened me — probably because the enforced isolation of cancer treatments has rendered me hypersensitive. It was raining outside and festivities would not begin until after 8 p.m. But my husband and I had promised to attend the celebration of a book publication. So we dragged ourselves to Judith and Aidan’s house where I hoped to find a comfortable chair in which I would not look like the battle-ax at Mrs. Dalloway’s party whom everyone had thought long dead. The house, crowded with people clutching drinks, pulsed with their robust vitality. Before the cancer diagnosis, I would have moved around the room schmoozing with a series of acquaintances while getting a tad tipsy. Now I was determined to have a drink, but I would need to sit down, and I could not control who might sit with me or indeed whether anyone would. Still, sit I had to do while dealing with a hideous mix of nostalgia, jealousy and self-pity. Exhausted by five years of surgeries and drugs, I have spent too much time alone and have nothing to exchange in return for tidbits of gossip. My colleagues, kind people, took turns as sitters. Unfortunately, the atmosphere of jollity only underscored my worries: fears that thinning hair would not hide my scalp, qualms about not recalling the names of graduate students I recognized but could not place. The cumulative effect of treatment also left me bereft of the prevarications and censors that ease everyday interactions. The membrane between internal feelings and external expressions (on which I used to rely) has worn thin. I have neither the time nor the energy to maintain buffers between me and the limited world I inhabit. Cancer has made me porous and susceptible to others — those I know personally, and those I do not. A friend in mourning, or runners and spectators maimed in Boston, reduce me to tears. Have other patients experienced this permeable sense of self when the barrier between the person we present in public and our private sentiments erodes? With few filters, I really do not belong in polite society. Just when I decided to give my husband a signal for us to up and leave, two guests started to sing in a corner of the room. I settled down, pleased at not having to make chitchat with my current sitter, a very young woman with a crew cut. A succession of musicians followed, producing that vivid vibrancy only live music in an intimate space can create. By the time Jason Fickel stood up to sing, accompanying himself on his acoustic guitar, my exhilaration knew no bounds. Live music should not be reserved for memorials. Musicians ought to be allowed to play in infusion centers, hospital rooms and hospices. Or so I think as my body feels sprayed and bathed, plumped and pumped by the rhythms of a melody that comes from Jason’s mouth and hands but courses through me like currents of energy. The wine helps, undoubtedly, but it is the thrumming strings and the wry yet sonorous voice that delight me, galvanizing my attention and quickening my spirits. I sense the vibrations on my skin, in my bones, massaging the synapses of my brain: “music, sweet music, music everywhere.” Let there be trombones and guitars, flutes and pianos, singing and, especially, cellos for the sick and the dying. During my mother’s last months in assisted care, she would have loved to have heard a string quartet: harmonies returning her to pleasures displaced by old age and disease. Awash and exultant as the music ends, I recall a line of poetry — “we feel that we are greater than we know”— and turn to the girl on my right. I did not remember her because, apparently, I had never met her before. But, she explained carefully, she works out with a member of my cancer support group … in a special class. A beat, a pause, and I understand. The crew cut has to do with cancer. I shake her hand to wish her well. Her fingers are icy. A surge urges me on: the need, the palpable urgency, to pay tribute to her resolute stamina. I clasp both her frozen hands and kiss them, overwhelmed that someone so young has had to go through what she has gone through, though I scold myself too, for these eruptions of extravagant emotion are sure to make me look like a fool. By the time Don and I got home, I realized that there are liabilities but also benefits of being thin-skinned. At the party I had felt the beauty, felt the fun. Lucky, lucky, lucky, I thought as I drifted off to sleep.

Sports   A Japanese Thread in the Bronx. Advertisement Advertisement JAN. 23, 2014 It all began with Hideki Irabu, who joined the Yankees in 1997 but never lived up to the initial fanfare that greeted him. Hideki Matsui did fulfill expectations, arriving in 2003 and becoming a steady and admirable presence in the Yankee lineup through 2009. After Matsui came Kei Igawa, a left-hander who was unable to pitch effectively in the major leagues. Hiroki Kuroda and the new acquisition Masahiro Tanaka will give the Yankees two Japanese starters in their 2014 rotation. Barring a trade, there should be a third Japanese player on this year’s roster: Ichiro Suzuki, who is entering his 14th season in the majors. Did we leave anyone out? Yes. The Yankees had another Japanese player, Ryota Igarashi, who flopped as a Met and pitched in two games in pinstripes, compiling an earned run average of 12.00. Last season he was back in Japan, pitching for the Fukuoka Hawks. Here are snapshots of all six Japanese Yankees, with Tanaka set to become No. 7. IRABU 3 seasons with the Yankees, 29-20 record, 2 World Series rings, 4.80 E.R.A. He made his highly publicized major league debut at Yankee Stadium on July 10, 1997, and beat Detroit before an announced crowd of more than 51,000. But during spring training in 1999, the Yankees’ owner, George Steinbrenner, referred to him as a fat toad. Irabu died in 2011 at age 42. Advertisement MATSUI 7 seasons with the Yankees, .292 average, 140 home runs, 1 World Series ring. Nicknamed Godzilla, he hit a grand slam in his first game in the Bronx and was named the most valuable player of the 2009 World Series after his last game there as a Yankee. IGAWA 5 seasons with the Yankees, but almost all of it in the minor leagues; 2-4 record with a 6.66 E.R.A. as a Yankee. He was a $46 million fiasco, perhaps the worst misjudgment Brian Cashman has made as the Yankees’ general manager. SUZUKI 1 1/2 seasons with the Yankees, .280 average, 209 hits. At 40, he is no longer the player he once was, but he needs just 258 hits to get to 3,000 as a major leaguer. KURODA 2 seasons with the Yankees, 27-24 record, 3.31 E.R.A. He faltered in the second half of last season, but he has often been an asset for the Yankees. He turns 39 next month. IGARASHI 2 games with the Yankees, 3 innings pitched, 4 earned runs, 12.00 E.R.A. His nickname in Japan was Rocket Boy, in tribute to his fastball. In the major leagues, the only rockets were the ones hit off his pitches. An article in some editions on Thursday about Japanese players who joined the Yankees misstated the year Hideki Irabu, a pitcher for the Yankees from 1997 to 1999, died. It was 2011, not 2001.

Business   Sharing an Android Tablet. Advertisement Advertisement Q&A By J. D. BIERSDORFER JAN. 24, 2014 Q. Is it possible for two people to use one Android tablet and keep their apps and settings separate? A. Tablets running Android 4.2 (and later) have a fairly easy way to set up multiple user accounts. Like multiple accounts on a desktop computer, each user account on the tablet has its own Home screen, settings and collection of apps. Android currently allows up to eight user accounts per tablet. To add a new user to your tablet in Android 4.4, open the Settings screen. (The exact steps and screens may vary based on the Android version and device you are using.) In the Device area, tap Users. On the Users & Profiles screen, tap “Add user or profile.” You are then presented with the choice of adding a User (a separate area of the tablet for the person to have their own apps, settings and files), or a Restricted Profile (a controlled version of your own account that can limit access to certain apps and files). Tap the User option. The person with whom you are sharing the tablet will need to go through the standard setup screens for adding an email account, configuring apps and customizing the account. Once the new account is set up, each user’s name and account picture appears on the tablet’s lock screen. Google’s site has more information on adding, modifying or deleting users on the same Android device. Advertisement Adding Photos to an iPhone Mail Message Q. Is there a way to add a photo to an email on the iPhone after you’ve already written the message? A. If the iPhone is running iOS 6 or iOS 7, you can attach a picture from the Photos app without leaving the Mail program. When you have the message open, press your finger on the iPhone’s screen until you see a small pop-up menu appear. On that menu, tap the “Insert Photo or Video” option; if you are still running iOS 6, tap the white arrow to get over to it. When the Photos screen opens, navigate to the image you want to send. Select it to attach to the open message. After you tap the Send button on the message, you get an option to select a file size for the image attachment. In older versions of iOS, you can still attach a photo after a message has been started, but it takes more effort. From the open Mail message on the screen, double-click the iPhone’s Home button to switch over to the Photos app. On the screen of photo thumbnails, press and hold the image you want to use until a Copy button appears. Tap Copy, then switch back to the Mail app. Go to the area of the message where you want to insert the image, then press down on the screen until a Paste option pops up. Tap Paste to attach the photo to the message. You can also start a message from the Photos app by selecting a photo (or group of photos) and tapping the Share icon in the corner. This pops open a new blank message with the pictures already attached. You just need to compose the text and address the message before sending it all off. Go to Home Page »

Foreign   New Law to Ban Manual Removal of Human Waste Disappoints. Advertisement   India’s widespread absence of flush toilets and sewer lines means much of the country’s human waste must be scraped out by hand, and then carried in baskets to dump sites. The people who carry out this dehumanizing task, almost exclusively women from the Dalit castes, experience severe discrimination. Among the Dalits, those who are born into the lowest castes handle these jobs and are put under immense social pressure to take up the occupation themselves. Since independence, discrimination based on caste has been banned and a law banning manual scavenging was passed in Parliament in 1993, but it didn’t ban dry toilets and had no employment aid for former workers. It has gone largely unenforced. Given that the new law prohibits the hiring of such workers and provides alternative job training, one would have expected human rights advocates like Ashif Shaikh, who has devoted 12 years to getting a stronger law passed, to feel a sense of accomplishment. “We are happy about the new law,” he said. But the specifics of implementation, which are decided by government committees, were “rubbish,” he said. For instance, the text of the new law includes provisions for the rehabilitation of scavengers through a one-time cash stipend, plus access to scholarships and free vocational training. But the law’s rules, which spell out how the law will be carried out, don’t reflect the ambitious spirit of the law itself, according to Mr. Shaikh. “If you look at the rules, the word rehabilitation isn’t even used once,” he said. “When we asked the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment about the lack of any specifics in the rules as to rehabilitation, they said, ‘We are preparing separate schemes for that.’ But schemes are not law, which we can hold accountable in court.” Mr. Shaikh and his fellow activists did have high hopes at one time that the new law would have enough teeth to eradicate these jobs, which are held by around 300,000 Dalits, according to government estimates. (Some Dalit rights activists say it could easily be triple that number.) The organization that Mr. Shaikh founded, Rashtriya Garima Abhiyan (National Campaign for Dignity), led a campaign last year in which 1,000 former manual scavengers traveled from village to village across 18 states for two months, persuading other women to leave the job and join them in “liberating” others. Mr. Shaikh said 5,000 more women ended up accompanying them to their final destination in Delhi. This caught the attention of policy makers, including Jairam Ramesh, the current Minister of Rural Development. Mr. Shaikh decided to capitalize on the momentum by bringing some of his newly “liberated” scavengers to knock on the doors of more than 50 members of Parliament who represented their districts. That way, the lawmakers could not claim that manual scavenging had been eradicated in their jurisdictions. Mr. Shaikh excitedly recounted a morning when Meenakshi Natarajan, a Congress Party lawmaker from Madhya Pradesh, served him and former manual scavengers breakfast in her living room. Dalits, let alone manual scavengers, are traditionally not allowed to enter the homes of higher caste people. Mr. Shaikh said these efforts by his organization and other Dalit activists are what led to the drafting of the most recent law. But they didn’t have power to specify how the law should be carried out. He pointed to the one chapter in the rules that deals with rehabilitation, while never using that word. It has only one clause, stating that former manual scavengers will be given a one-time “cash assistance,” without specifying by whom, when or how much. If implemented, the new law would severely curtail the use of dry toilets, also known as insanitary latrines, as it carries high fines and the possibility of jail time for those who employ manual scavengers or who fail to replace latrines that require manual cleaning. Those households using insanitary latrines will be held responsible for converting or demolishing them at their own cost, or the authorities under the orders of district magistrates will convert the latrines and recover the cost from the owner. Furthermore, offices of district magistrates around the country are required to survey existing dry toilets by Feb. 6, and their subsequent destruction must take place within six months of that date. In a phone interview last month, Sanjeev Kumar, joint secretary for the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, which sponsored the law, assured that these deadlines were “very strict” and that the government would spare no effort to enforce the new law, albeit mostly through existing government programs. “There is no need to worry about the specifics,” said Mr. Kumar. “Money won’t even be a consideration, not a barrier at all.” However, Manjula Pradeep, executive director of Navsarjan Trust, a Dalit rights nonprofit based in Gujarat, said that to her knowledge, with two weeks until the survey deadline, preparations haven’t yet begun in any state. “With national elections coming up, I think government is content to simply have passed the law,” she said. “Meanwhile, state governments continue to deny the widespread presence of manual scavengers in their states and use that as an excuse to delay new surveys indefinitely.” She used her own state as example, where the government has contended that Gujarat has no manual scavengers, despite two independent surveys that found over 10,000 of them. The central government, for its part, insists that it is committed to eliminating those jobs. “There can’t be a greater blot on India than the existence of manual scavenging,” Mr. Ramesh, the rural development minister, said in an interview. “Manual scavenging shows us how caste is still very much an Indian reality, and of how some of the system’s worst vestiges are still with us.” But Mr. Shaikh, having lost faith in the central government’s assurances, said his organization will now focus on state-level conventions in an attempt to pressure state governments to act upon the new law. Along with Mr. Shaikh and Ms. Pradeep, Bezwada Wilson completes the tripartite of activists who have been at the forefront of working to end the practice of manual scavenging both on the ground and through law. Mr. Wilson was born into a manual scavenging family and became one of the founders of Safai Karmachari Andolan, a people’s movement that aims to eradicate manual scavenging. Out of the three activists, he is the most radical and also the most distrusting of the government. He has already begun planning how to incorporate the expected failure to meet the Feb. 6 deadline into expansive public interest litigation against the central government. Mr. Wilson said he has given up on using political channels to accomplish his goals. “Really, the government may not have success anyway through laws,” he said. “It’s better if people like me directly go and speak these people’s language. When I go. I tell them, ‘There are 130 crore [1.3 billion] people in this country, and just like you most of them are poor. But only so many of them are scavenging. There are ways to live outside of this, even as a poor person,’ ” he said, pacing around his office. “Sometimes they don’t think they can just be a regular poor person.” He settled back into his chair and shook his head. “Still! The government should make an actual vision,” he said. “Tell us it will take 10 years. Just be honest.” India’s national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12, with results expected to be announced on May 16. The vote is the world’s largest, with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament. The other two seats will be appointed by the president. This election is widely considered to be India’s most consequential since 1977. India Ink will be moving to the World page of The New York Times.

Science   Not Your Grandmother’s Gratin Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement   In my kitchen, leftovers often become the inspiration for a week of Recipes for Health. This happened last week. If you had opened my refrigerator on Sunday you would have found a selection of roasted vegetables, which I had prepared over the weekend for various dinners and recipe tests. By Tuesday those vegetables had found their way into three winter gratins. A vegetable gratin is a casserole that is baked in the oven in a heavy baking dish until the top and sides are browned, or gratinéed. Roasting vegetables for a gratin adds another level of caramelized flavor to the dish. Roasted winter squash is particularly sweet. Roasting cauliflower coaxes flavor out of this somewhat bland vegetable: the small flowers brown and crisp, and I was hard pressed to save enough for my gratin, so tempting a snack were they. I begin just about any eggplant dish I make by roasting the eggplant, as this method of cooking requires much less oil than frying. I didn’t roast the vegetables in every one of this week’s recipes, but in all of the gratins the vegetables are cooked before being mixed with aromatics, cheese, eggs and, in all but one recipe, milk (in the cauliflower gratin, there is a tomato sauce rather than a milk and egg custard). I served them as main dishes and have been enjoying leftovers for lunch. They are delicious at room temperature as well as hot. Potato and Sorrel Gratin: A gratin that is not a typical creamy sliced potato gratin but more like a potato pie.  Roasted Squash and Red Onion Gratin With Quinoa: Roasting the squash results in a sweet layer of flavor in this beautiful gratin.  Fennel, Kale and Rice Gratin: Two different greens provide contrast in this casserole.  Roasted Cauliflower Gratin With Tomatoes and Goat Cheese: A beautiful, light gratin with Middle Eastern spices.

Business   Sufficient Financing to Aid Troubled Banks, European Officials Say. Advertisement    Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said at the World Economic Forum that if ailing banks were not able to raise capital from investors, they would draw it from their own governments, and as a last resort, from the European bailout fund. “The instruments are there,” Mr. Dijsselbloem, who is also the finance minister the Netherlands, said during a panel discussion. That level of certainty surprised at least one of the experts on the panel, Adair Turner, a former top bank regulator in Britain. Reflecting a widespread concern, Mr. Turner had expressed doubt whether Europe was prepared for the consequences if the European Central Bank’s scrutiny of the largest banks in the euro zone uncovered any that had grave problems that were previously hidden. “Is that already agreed?” he asked, referring to use of the bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. Mr. Dijsselbloem replied that euro zone finance ministers had agreed in principle and would grant final approval in March. “We will deal with all these issues,” he said. Among policy makers and many in the banking industry, there is broad agreement that Europe needs to carry out the same kind of rigorous cleanup of financial institutions that the United States did in 2009, helping restart lending and create the conditions for economic recovery. The European Central Bank is in the process of scouring bank books, looking for bad loans, sour investments or other problems that banks may have kept hidden. Fear that some banks are papering over serious problems has made it difficult for all banks in the euro zone to raise money that they can lend to businesses and consumers. The aim of the review is to ultimately restore the credibility of banks in the 18 countries of the euro zone. “There is still a clear lack of trust in the European banking system,” said Federico Ghizzoni, chief executive of UniCredit, the largest bank in Italy. “This has to be dissipated thanks to this exercise.” In the United States, banks with problems were forced to take capital from the government if they could not raise it themselves from investors. But Germany and some other countries have been reluctant to help finance bank cleanups in other euro zone countries. And there has been doubt whether countries like Portugal, already struggling with excess government debt, could afford bank rescues if any were needed. Also on the panel was Wolfgang Schäuble, finance minister of Germany, who did not contradict Mr Dijsselbloem. “It will work, it has been decided,” Mr. Schäuble said of the bank recapitalization plan, though he added that money would also come from a fund paid for by the banking industry, and only after bank creditors and shareholders had contributed. Echoing comments made on Friday by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, Mr. Dijsselbloem insisted that the review of banks would be comprehensive, in contrast to earlier attempts that failed to uncover serious problems. “I rather hope that it’s going to unveil some unpleasantness because that would give me a good feeling that it has been done properly,” he said. However, some on the panel doubted that lack of trust was the only reason that lending to businesses in the euro zone has been on the decline. Many businesses are reluctant to borrow money because of uncertainty about the strength of the economy, said Anshu Jain, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank. “There is a demand side problem as well,” he said.

Business   Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train. Advertisement Advertisement By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWADJAN. 25, 2014 CASSELTON, N.D. — Kerry’s Kitchen is where Casselton residents gather for gossip and comfort food, especially the caramel rolls baked fresh every morning. But a fiery rail accident last month only a half mile down the tracks, which prompted residents to evacuate the town, has shattered this calm, along with people’s confidence in the crude-oil convoys that rumble past Kerry’s seven times a day. What was first seen as a stopgap measure in the absence of pipelines has become a fixture in the nation’s energy landscape — about 200 “virtual pipelines” that snake in endless processions across the horizon daily. It can take more than five minutes for a single oil train, made up of about 100 tank cars, to pass by Kerry’s, giving this bedroom community 20 miles west of Fargo a front-row seat to the growing practice of using trains to carry oil. “I feel a little on edge — actually very edgy — every time one of those trains passes,” said Kerry Radermacher, who owns the coffee shop. “Most people think we should slow the production, and the trains, down.” Casselton is near the center of the great oil and gas boom unleashed these last few years. And it has seen up close how trains have increasingly been used to transport the oil from the new fields of Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, in part as a result of delays in the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. About 400,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail last year to the nation’s refineries, up from 9,500 in 2008, according to the Association of American Railroads. But a series of recent accidents — including one in Quebec last July that killed 47 people and another in Alabama last November — have prompted many to question these shipments and have increased the pressure on regulators to take an urgent look at the safety of the oil shipments. Advertisement In the race for profits and energy independence, critics say producers took shortcuts to get the oil to market as quickly as possible without weighing the hazards of train shipments. Today about two-thirds of the production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field rides on rails because of a shortage of pipelines. And more than 10 percent of the nation’s total oil production is shipped by rail. Since March there have been no fewer than 10 large crude spills in the United States and Canada because of rail accidents. The number of gallons spilled in the United States last year, federal records show, far outpaced the total amount spilled by railroads from 1975 to 2012. Railroad executives, meeting with the transportation secretary and federal regulators recently, pledged to look for ways to make oil convoys safer — including slowing down the trains or rerouting them from heavily populated areas. (Trains go up to roughly 35 miles an hour through towns and at higher speeds outside populated areas.) They also agreed to speed up a review of tougher standards for the train cars used for oil. And last Thursday, safety officials urged regulators to quickly improve industry standards. Advertisement “This is an industry that has developed overnight, and they have been playing catch-up with the infrastructure,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Casselton accident. “A lot of what we’ve seen could have been a lot worse.” But given the fragmented nature of the business — different companies produce the oil, own the rail cars, and run the railroads — there is no firm consensus on what to do. And few analysts expect new regulations this year. “There was no political pressure to address this issue in the past, but there clearly is now,” said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “Producers need to understand that rail-car safety can become an impediment to production.” The stakes are high. In five years, domestic oil production has jumped by 50 percent, to reach 7.5 million barrels a day last year. But with little pipeline infrastructure, energy producers had to scramble for new ways to get their oil to refiners. Rail was the answer. “The reality is that this came out of nowhere,” said Anthony B. Hatch, a rail transport consultant. “Rail has gone from near-obsolescence to being critical to oil supplies. It’s as if the buggy-whips were back in style.” Advertisement Far more toxic products are shipped on trains. But those products, like chlorine, are transported in pressurized vessels designed to survive an accident. Crude oil, on the other hand, is shipped in a type of tank car that entered service in 1964 and that has been traditionally used for nonflammable hazardous liquids like liquid fertilizers. Safety officials have warned for more than two decades that these cars were unsuited to carry flammable cargo: their shell can puncture and tears up too easily in a crash. In 2009, a train carrying ethanol derailed and exploded, killing one person in Cherry Valley, Ill. The National Transportation Safety Board said the inadequate design of the tank cars made them “subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials.” As domestic oil production has increased rapidly in recent years, more and more of it is being transported by rail because of the lack of pipeline capacity. The trains often travel through populated areas, leading to concerns among residents over the hazards they can pose, including spills and fires. 400 thousand Number of oil freight railroad cars 300 Some major oil freight railroad lines Casselton 200 Glenwood 100 Portage Minneapolis/St. Paul Milwaukee Chicago ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 Kansas City 3.0 billion barrels Shale plays Topeka St. Louis U.S. oil field production 2.5 Parsons Dexter Junction Stroud Bakersfield El Reno 2.0 Memphis Midwest City Little Rock Pine Bluff 1.5 Fort Worth Monroe Odessa Share transported by rail 1.0 Hearne Houston St. James Harwood 0.5 Galveston 10% Gardendale 7% 0.0 2% 1% ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 After that accident, railroads and car owners agreed in 2011 to beef up new cars with better protections and thicker steel. But they resisted improving safety features on the existing fleet because of cost. They also argued that thousands of new cars were being ordered anyway, so it would be just a matter of time before the fleet was replaced. But analysts said that time has run out; railroads and car owners can no longer ignore the liabilities associated with oil trains, which could reach $1 billion in the Quebec accident. “Quebec shocked the industry,” Mr. Hatch said, adding that while rail safety has improved over all, “the consequences of any accident are rising.” Last November, the Association of American Railroads said it would support requiring that the 92,000 tank cars used to transport flammable liquids, including crude oil, be retrofitted with better safety features or “aggressively phased out.” Still, other groups have resisted. The Railway Supply Institute, which represents freight car owners, told regulators three weeks before the Casselton accident that existing cars “already provide substantial protection in the event of a derailment” and suggested minor modifications to be phased in over 10 years. Advertisement While the safety record of railroads has improved in recent years, the surge in oil transportation has meant a spike in spill rates. From 1975 to 2012, federal records show, railroads spilled 800,000 gallons of crude oil. Last year alone, they spilled more than 1.15 million gallons, according to an analyis of data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration done by McClatchy Newspapers. That figure includes the Casselton spill, estimated at about 400,000 gallons. The accidents have also created a sense of weariness among elected officials and even staunch oil backers. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, insisted that the first priority was improving tank cars. “These exploding tank cars are obviously very powerful and very dangerous,” he said. The accidents have brought another problem to light. Crude oil produced in the Bakken appears to be a lot more volatile than other grades of oil, something that could explain why the oil trains have had huge explosions. Here too, the warnings came too late. Federal regulators started analyzing samples from a few Bakken wells last year to test their flammability. In an alert issued on Jan. 2, P.H.M.S.A. said the crude posed a “significant fire risk” in an accident. The Federal Railroad Administration also pointed to rising numbers of oil cars that showed a “form of severe corrosion” on the inside of the tanks, covers and valves. After the recent meeting with regulators, the American Petroleum Institute pledged it would share its own test data about the oil, which they have said is proprietary. While the tank cars themselves have not caused any accident, they failed to contain their cargo. That happened on the outskirts of Casselton when a 106-car oil train crashed into a soybean train that derailed on a parallel track. Advertisement In a preliminary report, the N.T.S.B. said 18 of the 20 oil tank cars that derailed were punctured. Much of the oil spilled was incinerated by the explosions, and some soaked into nearby corn fields. Aside from evacuating nearby farms, there was little the fire department could do but watch the train burn. Tim McLean, Casselton’s fire chief, pictured what the town would look like if an oil train derailed. The large propane supply tank would explode “like a bomb” and incinerate two multifamily houses next to it. Five blocks to the west are a lumber yard and two gasoline stations. Oil might accumulate in storm sewers and possibly spread a fire underground. “There’s virtually no way we could protect these buildings,” he said as he passed the barber shops, drugstore and pizza parlor, all occupying sturdy brick buildings more than a century old. “It would be too hot.” The terror of what might have happened hit many here immediately. Adrian Kieffer, the assistant fire chief, rushed to the accident and spent nearly 12 hours there, finishing at 3 a.m. “When I got home that night, my wife said let’s sell our home and move,” he said. An article last Sunday about the dangers posed by increased shipping of crude oil by rail omitted credit for a data analysis showing the quantity of oil spilled in rail shipments in 2013. It was done by McClatchy Newspapers, using data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. It was not analyzed by the administration itself. In addition, an accompanying chart omitted a label in one section. The bar chart of oil freight rail cars should have indicated the numbers were in thousands. The article also described the Casselton spill incorrectly in relation to last year’s spillage. The 400,000 gallons spilled at Casselton was included in the overall 1.15 million gallons spilled; it was not excluded. And a credit for a picture of a fiery rail accident in Casselton, N.D., in December misidentified the photographer. The picture was taken by Dawn Faught, a local photographer — not by the son of a coffee shop owner on whose phone it appeared.

Foreign   China Sentences Legal Activist to 4 Years for Role in Protests. Advertisement Advertisement By ANDREW JACOBS and CHRIS BUCKLEYJAN. 25, 2014 BEIJING — A Chinese court sentenced a prominent legal activist to four years in prison Sunday in a case widely seen as a demonstration of the Communist Party leadership’s determination to quell any challenges to its hold on power. The activist, Xu Zhiyong, was convicted of “gathering a crowd to disturb public order,” a charge that stemmed from his role organizing a grass-roots New Citizens Movement, which sought to give voice to public discontent over official corruption and social injustice. After a judge of the No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court in Beijing announced the guilty verdict and sentence, Mr. Xu denounced the trial as he was led away by guards, said one of Mr. Xu’s lawyers, Zhang Qingfang. “He said, ‘The court today has completely destroyed what remained of respect for rule of law in China,’ and then he was taken away,” said Mr. Zhang. His account of the verdict and Mr. Xu’s comment was confirmed by the other defense lawyer, Yang Jinzhu. “He can still appeal, but this outcome was decided by the senior leaders, and there’s no hope of changing the verdict,” Mr. Zhang said. He said the court could have imposed a maximum sentence of five years. Advertisement The judgment, coming unusually swiftly after a trial Wednesday, will silence Mr. Xu for now. But the sentence could also enhance Mr. Xu’s prominence as an advocate for political liberalization. Mr. Xu and his two lawyers remained silent in protest for most of the proceedings, but Mr. Xu used his concluding statement to deliver part of an impassioned manifesto for democratic change, free speech and rule of law. The full text has circulated on the Internet. For the verdict hearing, the police stood guard for blocks around the courthouse, keeping away journalists, diplomats and ordinary citizens concerned about the case. Journalists who tried to approach the court were told to leave. As the first prosecution of a high-profile activist under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party secretary who took power in November 2012, the case was seen as a barometer of how China’s new leadership — the first in a decade — would respond to organized calls for reform. Some liberal intellectuals and rights advocates initially hoped that Mr. Xi would be more tolerant than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, of mild campaigns for change. In 2012, Mr. Xu helped promote the New Citizens Movement, an organization that drew up to 5,000 members dedicated to fighting government graft and education policies restricting the children of rural migrants from attending big city schools. While many of the group’s activities involved informal discussions at restaurants across the country, some of its members took part in small street rallies in 2012 and early 2013 that unnerved the Communist Party leadership. Prosecutors claimed Mr. Xu was the “ringleader” of several protests in Beijing during which participants held aloft banners denouncing corruption or demanding an end to the nation’s discriminatory education policies. Other participants in the New Citizens Movement and similar protests also face prosecution, including two who stood trial in the two days after Mr. Xu’s trial. Four others face trial Monday in Beijing, according to Human Rights in China. Legal experts and human rights advocates described the prosecution of Mr. Xu as deeply flawed. His lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, whose testimony was submitted in writing only so they did not appear in court. Nor were the defense lawyers permitted to call in witnesses of their own. Advertisement Mr. Xu’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the legality of holding separate trials for the New Citizens Movement defendants in Beijing, a move they said prevented them from benefiting from testimony that could help in their defense. Mr. Zhang, one of his lawyers, called the trial last Wednesday “a piece of theater.” Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Mr. Xu’s slapdash prosecution and the sentence were designed to deter others seeking to agitate against the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. “It sends out the message that the law is essentially a tool for the party to rule the citizenry, not for the citizenry to curtail the power of the state,” he said. Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

Society   And Their Beat Goes On. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIJAN. 26, 2014 Margaret Mary Ocampo and Benjamin Paul Scheck were married Saturday at St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens. Msgr. Michael J. Brennan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. The bride, 26, teaches fourth grade at Public School 169 in the Bronx. She graduated magna cum laude from Queens College and received a master’s degree in the literacy specialist program at Columbia. She is a daughter of Monserrat M. Washburn of East Meadow, N.Y., and Jaime M. Ocampo of Queens Village. The groom, also 26, is a certified public accountant who works in Manhattan as an internal auditor with Advance Publications, a publisher of magazines and newspapers. He graduated from Baruch College, where he also received a master’s degree in taxation. He is the son of Angela Scheck and Robert I. Scheck of Flushing. The couple met in 2005 when they were high school seniors at St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. Advertisement “We sat across from each other in a computer class,” Mr. Scheck recalled. “I had never seen her before. I really wanted to get to know her.” Eventually he completed that assignment. “It took about a month; I had to build up a little courage,” he said. “She was a lot of fun, being with her just seemed right.” They were soon inseparable. “I liked the fact that we had a similar sense of humor,” Ms. Ocampo said. “We also both loved music; he was more a fan of classic rock and I liked classical and pop.” That shared love led to the creation of their rock band, Cover Fire, during their senior year in college. She is the lead singer. He plays bass guitar. “It’s still a lot of fun,” Ms. Ocampo said. On Nov. 22, 2012, Mr. Scheck proposed to Ms. Ocampo beneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. “I was taking photos and then I turned around to find him down on one knee,” she said. “At that point we had been going out for years and had been on so many trips together that I really didn’t expect anything. I was truly shocked.” VINCENT M. MALLOZZI A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page ST13 of the New York edition with the headline: And Their Beat Goes On.

Sports   Ducks Triumph at Dodger Stadium as Volleyballs and Frisbees Fly. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREN CROUSEJAN. 26, 2014 LOS ANGELES — Outdoor hockey, Southern California-style, debuted Saturday night with face-offs and Frisbees, spiked volleyballs and a stuffed penalty shot, Bob Miller partnering with Vin Scully and the iconoclastic pitcher Brian Wilson mingling with the icon Wayne Gretzky. The temperature at the start of the history-making game at Dodger Stadium between the Kings and the visiting Anaheim Ducks, rivals separated by 31 miles of interstate, was 61 degrees with a slight breeze. The balmy weather notwithstanding, it was easy to get the chills during the first regular-season outdoor hockey game in California, won by the Ducks in a 3-0 shutout. First there was a joint introduction by the Kings’ Miller and the Dodgers’ Scully, the city’s two legendary broadcasters. Then Gretzky performed the ceremonial opening puck drop, the only man for the honor given how he single-handedly made hockey cool in warm-weather cities. By the time the game started, the crowd of 54,099 was in full roar, with “Go Kings Go” cries followed by chants of “Beat L.A.” It was left to Jonas Hiller, the Ducks goaltender, to silence the Kings crowd, and he was more than up to the task. Hiller, who will represent Switzerland at next month’s Sochi Games, made 36 saves, including 20 in the opening 20 minutes, to leave his mark in the hallowed home of Koufax and Kershaw, where other visitors have included the Beatles and the Pope. Advertisement Corey Perry, who described the experience of playing outdoors as “getting back to your roots,” swept a loose puck past the Kings’ goaltender, Jonathan Quick, in the third minute for his 28th goal of the season. Matt Beleskey redirected the puck past Quick less than six minutes later. Collecting the second assist was Teemu Selanne, 43, who first graced a Ducks jersey in February of 1996, when Beleskey was 7. Asked if he enjoyed the game, Selanne said: “Absolutely. Way more than a normal game. It was a great experience.” For the Ducks, maybe. In the 10th minute, Anze Kopitar was awarded a penalty shot but he was stopped by Hiller. When Kopitar failed to score, the air went out of the lungs of the Kings fans. Anyone who follows the team knows well its recent struggles to put the puck in the net. In their last five games, all losses, the Kings have been outscored, 16-8. They haven’t scored since Kopitar’s goal in the fourth minute of their game Thursday against the Ducks in Anaheim. The puck at times bounced off players’ sticks like a bad grounder off a shortstop’s glove. The ice, while slushier than usual, was not terrible. Ben Lovejoy, the Ducks defenseman responsible for hooking Kopitar to set up the penalty shot, had described the ice as “good enough” after practicing on it Friday. On the eve of the game, Lovejoy said, “We might not want to skate on this ice 82 times a year, but for one night against the Kings in January this is going to be the best thing that’s happened to hockey in Southern California.” Since Gretzky, that is. The Battle at the Ballpark, as Miller coined it, was a spectacle that Gretzky built one point at a time during his eight years as the National Hockey League’s L.A.-based proselytizer of puck. He delivered everything to Southern California but the Stanley Cup, and since his retirement both the Kings and Ducks have taken care of that piece of unfinished business, with the Ducks winning the N.H.L. championship in 2007 and the Kings taking the title in 2012. “If somebody would tell me 10 years ago that we’re going to have an outdoor game here, that would really sound crazy,” Selanne said. “Everything is different now than it used to be. California has become a big hockey place.” Advertisement The rock band KISS, conceived in New York and commanded by Gene Simmons, performed before the game and during the first intermission. Five for Fighting — the rock band, not a group of Vancouver Canucks – performed in the second intermission. When the hockey stopped, the children’s bandy game and the adult beach volleyball matches began anew, headlined by Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who also happens to be a die-hard fan of the Dodgers’ big rivals, the San Francisco Giants. Other sports luminaries in attendance included Wilson, the Dodgers’ Mohawk-shorn pitcher, Yasiel Puig, Fernando Valenzuela and Tommy Lasorda. On this might it did not matter if you were a Dodger hater or a beloved former Dodger, a Ducks fan or a Kings fan, a hockey purist or an arriviste here to watch and be seen. What mattered was that on an unusually warm winter’s night, the beach balls and the Frisbees and the sand and the rock musicians were the side shows and the N.H.L., in a twist that would have been inconceivable a quarter of a century ago, was the main act.

Travel   Amy Tan’s Evolving Sense of China. Advertisement Advertisement By KENAN CHRISTIANSENJAN. 24, 2014 In 1949, Amy Tan’s mother boarded one of the last ships heading from Shanghai to San Francisco before “China became Red China and the bamboo curtain descended.” There, her mother reunited with her husband and the couple relocated to Oakland, where a couple of years later she was born. As a child, she knew little more about China than an “American pastiche of stereotypes,” and that some of her family had been lucky enough to make it out, while others had not. For years she organized her thinking around those divisions, until revelations about her family and the country her parents fled broke them down. Below are excerpts from correspondence with Ms. Tan, 61, whose latest novel is “The Valley of Amazement,” about how her relationship with China changed over time. Q. What were your earliest thoughts about China? A. Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, I thought of China as a prison that everyone wanted to escape. My parents considered themselves lucky that they were able to leave before 1949. Other family members were not quite as lucky and wound up in Formosa — that’s what we called Taiwan in those days. They sent us letters that described hard work and lack of proper food, hygiene and clothing. In their photos, they looked shockingly weathered and shiny with sweat. We received no letters from China and prayed for those silent ones whose whereabouts were unknown. If America was heaven, Formosa would be limbo, and China would be hell. Were you ever in contact with those family members before visiting?  When I was 16, after my father died, my mother told me that she had been married to another man in Shanghai before she met my father. I could hardly comprehend this stunning news, when she added she also had three daughters in China. She did not explain why they were in China, whereas she was in California. Years later she would only say that her previous husband had been a bad man. If I pressed her she would have said that I did not understand because I was an American. That was her typical lament when I did not seem to appreciate the tragedies of her life, like the suicide of her mother, which left her alone — abandoned, really — at the age of 9. She showed me their photos. The middle daughter, Jindo, was beautiful. She resembled my mother. She also fit the stereotype of peasants I had imagined in childhood. She wore a conical hat and farmer’s clothing, and she was standing next to a rice field. That could have been my life. Afterward, China was no longer an invisible jail. I now imagined myself living there, wearing a conical hat and writing letters late at night to my mother, in beautiful Chinese calligraphy like that of my newfound sisters. “I dream every day you will return,” Jindo had written her. “When you do, my happiness will be restored.” Advertisement Did she return? Yes, in 1979, after a 30-year separation, my mother went to visit her three daughters. Jindo lived in a village of rice farmers. She had married a surgeon, and they and several comrades served my mother a modest feast in a shack whose walls were lined with newspaper to keep out the cold. When was your first visit? In 1987, my mother, husband and I went together. We stepped out of the plane into an airport painted toothpaste green. I had assumed I would blend in with the masses. Instead, I was surrounded by locals who gawked at me and made open comments about my outlandish purple clothing. These days, I go about once a year. The most gleamingly modern airports I’ve been to are in China. The coolest and most technologically challenging hotel I’ve ever stayed in is in China. The most tricked-out hair salon I’ve been to is in China. The worst pollution I’ve endured is in China. I keep going back for more of the most. Not everyone wants to escape anymore. In fact, it is more often the case that Chinese students go to the U.S. to study and return to start companies and make millions. Has your attitude on China changed? I look at China not as a land of burdens and debt but the land of origin that gave our family its improbable history. I once traveled with Jindo on a long ferry ride to a mansion, the one on the island near Shanghai, where my mother grew up, where Jindo also grew up. I listened to her stories about working in the rice fields, where she wore the conical hat and danced and yelled as she pulled leeches off her calves. She eventually told me what happened to her after our mother left, about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father’s concubine. As Jindo re-enacted the past, she flung her arms and beat her chest, and it must have appeared that we were having a violent argument. “It was not right,” she said repeatedly, and she meant what her stepmother did to her, and also what her father did to our mother, and what my mother did in choosing to be with a lover rather than with her three daughters, and then in marrying that lover and having three children by him, one of them a daughter, who was sitting next to her, listening to her cry. An answer in the Q&A column on Jan. 26, in which the novelist Amy Tan discussed her relationship with China and how it has changed over time, referred incorrectly to a relative in China. Her half-sister married a surgeon, not a “barefoot doctor.” A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: Amy Tan Reflects on China and Uncovering Secrets of Her Origins.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Business   Wheelies: The Detroit Rising Edition. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 28, 2014 A roundup of motoring news from the web: ■ This year’s Detroit auto show reported its highest attendance in more than 10 years. A total of 803,451 people visited the 2014 show — a significant one for General Motors, which took both the North American car and truck of the year awards. Attendance has not been that high since 838,066 people came to the show in 2003. (Jalopnik) ■ In its efforts to get people used to the idea that its new F-150 pickup trucks will be built with aluminum bodies, Ford told its dealers Sunday that the new trucks will actually be cheaper and easier to repair than the outgoing model. Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ BMW says that its all-electric i3 will arrive in American showrooms in May, priced similarly to the 3 Series. Ludwig Willisch, who heads BMW North America, said that the United States would be the company’s largest market for the i Series electric cars, adding that demand for the i3 will most likely outstrip supply in the first year of production.

Business   Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train. Advertisement Advertisement By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWADJAN. 25, 2014 CASSELTON, N.D. — Kerry’s Kitchen is where Casselton residents gather for gossip and comfort food, especially the caramel rolls baked fresh every morning. But a fiery rail accident last month only a half mile down the tracks, which prompted residents to evacuate the town, has shattered this calm, along with people’s confidence in the crude-oil convoys that rumble past Kerry’s seven times a day. What was first seen as a stopgap measure in the absence of pipelines has become a fixture in the nation’s energy landscape — about 200 “virtual pipelines” that snake in endless processions across the horizon daily. It can take more than five minutes for a single oil train, made up of about 100 tank cars, to pass by Kerry’s, giving this bedroom community 20 miles west of Fargo a front-row seat to the growing practice of using trains to carry oil. “I feel a little on edge — actually very edgy — every time one of those trains passes,” said Kerry Radermacher, who owns the coffee shop. “Most people think we should slow the production, and the trains, down.” Casselton is near the center of the great oil and gas boom unleashed these last few years. And it has seen up close how trains have increasingly been used to transport the oil from the new fields of Colorado, Wyoming and North Dakota, in part as a result of delays in the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. About 400,000 carloads of crude oil traveled by rail last year to the nation’s refineries, up from 9,500 in 2008, according to the Association of American Railroads. But a series of recent accidents — including one in Quebec last July that killed 47 people and another in Alabama last November — have prompted many to question these shipments and have increased the pressure on regulators to take an urgent look at the safety of the oil shipments. Advertisement In the race for profits and energy independence, critics say producers took shortcuts to get the oil to market as quickly as possible without weighing the hazards of train shipments. Today about two-thirds of the production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil field rides on rails because of a shortage of pipelines. And more than 10 percent of the nation’s total oil production is shipped by rail. Since March there have been no fewer than 10 large crude spills in the United States and Canada because of rail accidents. The number of gallons spilled in the United States last year, federal records show, far outpaced the total amount spilled by railroads from 1975 to 2012. Railroad executives, meeting with the transportation secretary and federal regulators recently, pledged to look for ways to make oil convoys safer — including slowing down the trains or rerouting them from heavily populated areas. (Trains go up to roughly 35 miles an hour through towns and at higher speeds outside populated areas.) They also agreed to speed up a review of tougher standards for the train cars used for oil. And last Thursday, safety officials urged regulators to quickly improve industry standards. Advertisement “This is an industry that has developed overnight, and they have been playing catch-up with the infrastructure,” said Deborah A. P. Hersman, the chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the Casselton accident. “A lot of what we’ve seen could have been a lot worse.” But given the fragmented nature of the business — different companies produce the oil, own the rail cars, and run the railroads — there is no firm consensus on what to do. And few analysts expect new regulations this year. “There was no political pressure to address this issue in the past, but there clearly is now,” said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “Producers need to understand that rail-car safety can become an impediment to production.” The stakes are high. In five years, domestic oil production has jumped by 50 percent, to reach 7.5 million barrels a day last year. But with little pipeline infrastructure, energy producers had to scramble for new ways to get their oil to refiners. Rail was the answer. “The reality is that this came out of nowhere,” said Anthony B. Hatch, a rail transport consultant. “Rail has gone from near-obsolescence to being critical to oil supplies. It’s as if the buggy-whips were back in style.” Advertisement Far more toxic products are shipped on trains. But those products, like chlorine, are transported in pressurized vessels designed to survive an accident. Crude oil, on the other hand, is shipped in a type of tank car that entered service in 1964 and that has been traditionally used for nonflammable hazardous liquids like liquid fertilizers. Safety officials have warned for more than two decades that these cars were unsuited to carry flammable cargo: their shell can puncture and tears up too easily in a crash. In 2009, a train carrying ethanol derailed and exploded, killing one person in Cherry Valley, Ill. The National Transportation Safety Board said the inadequate design of the tank cars made them “subject to damage and catastrophic loss of hazardous materials.” As domestic oil production has increased rapidly in recent years, more and more of it is being transported by rail because of the lack of pipeline capacity. The trains often travel through populated areas, leading to concerns among residents over the hazards they can pose, including spills and fires. 400 thousand Number of oil freight railroad cars 300 Some major oil freight railroad lines Casselton 200 Glenwood 100 Portage Minneapolis/St. Paul Milwaukee Chicago ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 Kansas City 3.0 billion barrels Shale plays Topeka St. Louis U.S. oil field production 2.5 Parsons Dexter Junction Stroud Bakersfield El Reno 2.0 Memphis Midwest City Little Rock Pine Bluff 1.5 Fort Worth Monroe Odessa Share transported by rail 1.0 Hearne Houston St. James Harwood 0.5 Galveston 10% Gardendale 7% 0.0 2% 1% ’05 ’07 ’09 ’11 ’13 After that accident, railroads and car owners agreed in 2011 to beef up new cars with better protections and thicker steel. But they resisted improving safety features on the existing fleet because of cost. They also argued that thousands of new cars were being ordered anyway, so it would be just a matter of time before the fleet was replaced. But analysts said that time has run out; railroads and car owners can no longer ignore the liabilities associated with oil trains, which could reach $1 billion in the Quebec accident. “Quebec shocked the industry,” Mr. Hatch said, adding that while rail safety has improved over all, “the consequences of any accident are rising.” Last November, the Association of American Railroads said it would support requiring that the 92,000 tank cars used to transport flammable liquids, including crude oil, be retrofitted with better safety features or “aggressively phased out.” Still, other groups have resisted. The Railway Supply Institute, which represents freight car owners, told regulators three weeks before the Casselton accident that existing cars “already provide substantial protection in the event of a derailment” and suggested minor modifications to be phased in over 10 years. Advertisement While the safety record of railroads has improved in recent years, the surge in oil transportation has meant a spike in spill rates. From 1975 to 2012, federal records show, railroads spilled 800,000 gallons of crude oil. Last year alone, they spilled more than 1.15 million gallons, according to an analyis of data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration done by McClatchy Newspapers. That figure includes the Casselton spill, estimated at about 400,000 gallons. The accidents have also created a sense of weariness among elected officials and even staunch oil backers. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, insisted that the first priority was improving tank cars. “These exploding tank cars are obviously very powerful and very dangerous,” he said. The accidents have brought another problem to light. Crude oil produced in the Bakken appears to be a lot more volatile than other grades of oil, something that could explain why the oil trains have had huge explosions. Here too, the warnings came too late. Federal regulators started analyzing samples from a few Bakken wells last year to test their flammability. In an alert issued on Jan. 2, P.H.M.S.A. said the crude posed a “significant fire risk” in an accident. The Federal Railroad Administration also pointed to rising numbers of oil cars that showed a “form of severe corrosion” on the inside of the tanks, covers and valves. After the recent meeting with regulators, the American Petroleum Institute pledged it would share its own test data about the oil, which they have said is proprietary. While the tank cars themselves have not caused any accident, they failed to contain their cargo. That happened on the outskirts of Casselton when a 106-car oil train crashed into a soybean train that derailed on a parallel track. Advertisement In a preliminary report, the N.T.S.B. said 18 of the 20 oil tank cars that derailed were punctured. Much of the oil spilled was incinerated by the explosions, and some soaked into nearby corn fields. Aside from evacuating nearby farms, there was little the fire department could do but watch the train burn. Tim McLean, Casselton’s fire chief, pictured what the town would look like if an oil train derailed. The large propane supply tank would explode “like a bomb” and incinerate two multifamily houses next to it. Five blocks to the west are a lumber yard and two gasoline stations. Oil might accumulate in storm sewers and possibly spread a fire underground. “There’s virtually no way we could protect these buildings,” he said as he passed the barber shops, drugstore and pizza parlor, all occupying sturdy brick buildings more than a century old. “It would be too hot.” The terror of what might have happened hit many here immediately. Adrian Kieffer, the assistant fire chief, rushed to the accident and spent nearly 12 hours there, finishing at 3 a.m. “When I got home that night, my wife said let’s sell our home and move,” he said. An article last Sunday about the dangers posed by increased shipping of crude oil by rail omitted credit for a data analysis showing the quantity of oil spilled in rail shipments in 2013. It was done by McClatchy Newspapers, using data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. It was not analyzed by the administration itself. In addition, an accompanying chart omitted a label in one section. The bar chart of oil freight rail cars should have indicated the numbers were in thousands. The article also described the Casselton spill incorrectly in relation to last year’s spillage. The 400,000 gallons spilled at Casselton was included in the overall 1.15 million gallons spilled; it was not excluded. And a credit for a picture of a fiery rail accident in Casselton, N.D., in December misidentified the photographer. The picture was taken by Dawn Faught, a local photographer — not by the son of a coffee shop owner on whose phone it appeared. A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Accidents Surge as Oil Industry Takes the Train.

Foreign   China Sentences Legal Activist to 4 Years for Role in Protests. Advertisement Advertisement By ANDREW JACOBS and CHRIS BUCKLEYJAN. 25, 2014 BEIJING — A Chinese court sentenced a prominent legal activist to four years in prison Sunday in a case widely seen as a demonstration of the Communist Party leadership’s determination to quell any challenges to its hold on power. The activist, Xu Zhiyong, was convicted of “gathering a crowd to disturb public order,” a charge that stemmed from his role organizing a grass-roots New Citizens Movement, which sought to give voice to public discontent over official corruption and social injustice. After a judge of the No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court in Beijing announced the guilty verdict and sentence, Mr. Xu denounced the trial as he was led away by guards, said one of Mr. Xu’s lawyers, Zhang Qingfang. “He said, ‘The court today has completely destroyed what remained of respect for rule of law in China,’ and then he was taken away,” said Mr. Zhang. His account of the verdict and Mr. Xu’s comment was confirmed by the other defense lawyer, Yang Jinzhu. “He can still appeal, but this outcome was decided by the senior leaders, and there’s no hope of changing the verdict,” Mr. Zhang said. He said the court could have imposed a maximum sentence of five years. Advertisement The judgment, coming unusually swiftly after a trial Wednesday, will silence Mr. Xu for now. But the sentence could also enhance Mr. Xu’s prominence as an advocate for political liberalization. Mr. Xu and his two lawyers remained silent in protest for most of the proceedings, but Mr. Xu used his concluding statement to deliver part of an impassioned manifesto for democratic change, free speech and rule of law. The full text has circulated on the Internet. For the verdict hearing, the police stood guard for blocks around the courthouse, keeping away journalists, diplomats and ordinary citizens concerned about the case. Journalists who tried to approach the court were told to leave. As the first prosecution of a high-profile activist under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party secretary who took power in November 2012, the case was seen as a barometer of how China’s new leadership — the first in a decade — would respond to organized calls for reform. Some liberal intellectuals and rights advocates initially hoped that Mr. Xi would be more tolerant than his predecessor, Hu Jintao, of mild campaigns for change. In 2012, Mr. Xu helped promote the New Citizens Movement, an organization that drew up to 5,000 members dedicated to fighting government graft and education policies restricting the children of rural migrants from attending big city schools. While many of the group’s activities involved informal discussions at restaurants across the country, some of its members took part in small street rallies in 2012 and early 2013 that unnerved the Communist Party leadership. Prosecutors claimed Mr. Xu was the “ringleader” of several protests in Beijing during which participants held aloft banners denouncing corruption or demanding an end to the nation’s discriminatory education policies. Other participants in the New Citizens Movement and similar protests also face prosecution, including two who stood trial in the two days after Mr. Xu’s trial. Four others face trial Monday in Beijing, according to Human Rights in China. Legal experts and human rights advocates described the prosecution of Mr. Xu as deeply flawed. His lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, whose testimony was submitted in writing only so they did not appear in court. Nor were the defense lawyers permitted to call in witnesses of their own. Advertisement Mr. Xu’s lawyers unsuccessfully challenged the legality of holding separate trials for the New Citizens Movement defendants in Beijing, a move they said prevented them from benefiting from testimony that could help in their defense. Mr. Zhang, one of his lawyers, called the trial last Wednesday “a piece of theater.” Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, said Mr. Xu’s slapdash prosecution and the sentence were designed to deter others seeking to agitate against the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. “It sends out the message that the law is essentially a tool for the party to rule the citizenry, not for the citizenry to curtail the power of the state,” he said. Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong.

Society   And Their Beat Goes On. Advertisement Advertisement By VINCENT M. MALLOZZIJAN. 26, 2014 Margaret Mary Ocampo and Benjamin Paul Scheck were married Saturday at St. Andrew Avellino Roman Catholic Church in Flushing, Queens. Msgr. Michael J. Brennan, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. The bride, 26, teaches fourth grade at Public School 169 in the Bronx. She graduated magna cum laude from Queens College and received a master’s degree in the literacy specialist program at Columbia. She is a daughter of Monserrat M. Washburn of East Meadow, N.Y., and Jaime M. Ocampo of Queens Village. The groom, also 26, is a certified public accountant who works in Manhattan as an internal auditor with Advance Publications, a publisher of magazines and newspapers. He graduated from Baruch College, where he also received a master’s degree in taxation. He is the son of Angela Scheck and Robert I. Scheck of Flushing. The couple met in 2005 when they were high school seniors at St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. Advertisement “We sat across from each other in a computer class,” Mr. Scheck recalled. “I had never seen her before. I really wanted to get to know her.” Eventually he completed that assignment. “It took about a month; I had to build up a little courage,” he said. “She was a lot of fun, being with her just seemed right.” They were soon inseparable. “I liked the fact that we had a similar sense of humor,” Ms. Ocampo said. “We also both loved music; he was more a fan of classic rock and I liked classical and pop.” That shared love led to the creation of their rock band, Cover Fire, during their senior year in college. She is the lead singer. He plays bass guitar. “It’s still a lot of fun,” Ms. Ocampo said. On Nov. 22, 2012, Mr. Scheck proposed to Ms. Ocampo beneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. “I was taking photos and then I turned around to find him down on one knee,” she said. “At that point we had been going out for years and had been on so many trips together that I really didn’t expect anything. I was truly shocked.” VINCENT M. MALLOZZI A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page ST13 of the New York edition with the headline: And Their Beat Goes On.

Sports   Ducks Triumph at Dodger Stadium as Volleyballs and Frisbees Fly. Advertisement Advertisement By KAREN CROUSEJAN. 26, 2014 LOS ANGELES — Outdoor hockey, Southern California-style, debuted Saturday night with face-offs and Frisbees, spiked volleyballs and a stuffed penalty shot, Bob Miller partnering with Vin Scully and the iconoclastic pitcher Brian Wilson mingling with the icon Wayne Gretzky. The temperature at the start of the history-making game at Dodger Stadium between the Kings and the visiting Anaheim Ducks, rivals separated by 31 miles of interstate, was 61 degrees with a slight breeze. The balmy weather notwithstanding, it was easy to get the chills during the first regular-season outdoor hockey game in California, won by the Ducks in a 3-0 shutout. First there was a joint introduction by the Kings’ Miller and the Dodgers’ Scully, the city’s two legendary broadcasters. Then Gretzky performed the ceremonial opening puck drop, the only man for the honor given how he single-handedly made hockey cool in warm-weather cities. By the time the game started, the crowd of 54,099 was in full roar, with “Go Kings Go” cries followed by chants of “Beat L.A.” It was left to Jonas Hiller, the Ducks goaltender, to silence the Kings crowd, and he was more than up to the task. Hiller, who will represent Switzerland at next month’s Sochi Games, made 36 saves, including 20 in the opening 20 minutes, to leave his mark in the hallowed home of Koufax and Kershaw, where other visitors have included the Beatles and the Pope. Advertisement Corey Perry, who described the experience of playing outdoors as “getting back to your roots,” swept a loose puck past the Kings’ goaltender, Jonathan Quick, in the third minute for his 28th goal of the season. Matt Beleskey redirected the puck past Quick less than six minutes later. Collecting the second assist was Teemu Selanne, 43, who first graced a Ducks jersey in February of 1996, when Beleskey was 7. Asked if he enjoyed the game, Selanne said: “Absolutely. Way more than a normal game. It was a great experience.” For the Ducks, maybe. In the 10th minute, Anze Kopitar was awarded a penalty shot but he was stopped by Hiller. When Kopitar failed to score, the air went out of the lungs of the Kings fans. Anyone who follows the team knows well its recent struggles to put the puck in the net. In their last five games, all losses, the Kings have been outscored, 16-8. They haven’t scored since Kopitar’s goal in the fourth minute of their game Thursday against the Ducks in Anaheim. The puck at times bounced off players’ sticks like a bad grounder off a shortstop’s glove. The ice, while slushier than usual, was not terrible. Ben Lovejoy, the Ducks defenseman responsible for hooking Kopitar to set up the penalty shot, had described the ice as “good enough” after practicing on it Friday. On the eve of the game, Lovejoy said, “We might not want to skate on this ice 82 times a year, but for one night against the Kings in January this is going to be the best thing that’s happened to hockey in Southern California.” Since Gretzky, that is. The Battle at the Ballpark, as Miller coined it, was a spectacle that Gretzky built one point at a time during his eight years as the National Hockey League’s L.A.-based proselytizer of puck. He delivered everything to Southern California but the Stanley Cup, and since his retirement both the Kings and Ducks have taken care of that piece of unfinished business, with the Ducks winning the N.H.L. championship in 2007 and the Kings taking the title in 2012. “If somebody would tell me 10 years ago that we’re going to have an outdoor game here, that would really sound crazy,” Selanne said. “Everything is different now than it used to be. California has become a big hockey place.” Advertisement The rock band KISS, conceived in New York and commanded by Gene Simmons, performed before the game and during the first intermission. Five for Fighting — the rock band, not a group of Vancouver Canucks – performed in the second intermission. When the hockey stopped, the children’s bandy game and the adult beach volleyball matches began anew, headlined by Kerri Walsh Jennings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who also happens to be a die-hard fan of the Dodgers’ big rivals, the San Francisco Giants. Other sports luminaries in attendance included Wilson, the Dodgers’ Mohawk-shorn pitcher, Yasiel Puig, Fernando Valenzuela and Tommy Lasorda. On this might it did not matter if you were a Dodger hater or a beloved former Dodger, a Ducks fan or a Kings fan, a hockey purist or an arriviste here to watch and be seen. What mattered was that on an unusually warm winter’s night, the beach balls and the Frisbees and the sand and the rock musicians were the side shows and the N.H.L., in a twist that would have been inconceivable a quarter of a century ago, was the main act.

Travel   Amy Tan’s Evolving Sense of China. Advertisement Advertisement By KENAN CHRISTIANSENJAN. 24, 2014 In 1949, Amy Tan’s mother boarded one of the last ships heading from Shanghai to San Francisco before “China became Red China and the bamboo curtain descended.” There, her mother reunited with her husband and the couple relocated to Oakland, where a couple of years later she was born. As a child, she knew little more about China than an “American pastiche of stereotypes,” and that some of her family had been lucky enough to make it out, while others had not. For years she organized her thinking around those divisions, until revelations about her family and the country her parents fled broke them down. Below are excerpts from correspondence with Ms. Tan, 61, whose latest novel is “The Valley of Amazement,” about how her relationship with China changed over time. Q. What were your earliest thoughts about China? A. Growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, I thought of China as a prison that everyone wanted to escape. My parents considered themselves lucky that they were able to leave before 1949. Other family members were not quite as lucky and wound up in Formosa — that’s what we called Taiwan in those days. They sent us letters that described hard work and lack of proper food, hygiene and clothing. In their photos, they looked shockingly weathered and shiny with sweat. We received no letters from China and prayed for those silent ones whose whereabouts were unknown. If America was heaven, Formosa would be limbo, and China would be hell. Were you ever in contact with those family members before visiting?  When I was 16, after my father died, my mother told me that she had been married to another man in Shanghai before she met my father. I could hardly comprehend this stunning news, when she added she also had three daughters in China. She did not explain why they were in China, whereas she was in California. Years later she would only say that her previous husband had been a bad man. If I pressed her she would have said that I did not understand because I was an American. That was her typical lament when I did not seem to appreciate the tragedies of her life, like the suicide of her mother, which left her alone — abandoned, really — at the age of 9. She showed me their photos. The middle daughter, Jindo, was beautiful. She resembled my mother. She also fit the stereotype of peasants I had imagined in childhood. She wore a conical hat and farmer’s clothing, and she was standing next to a rice field. That could have been my life. Afterward, China was no longer an invisible jail. I now imagined myself living there, wearing a conical hat and writing letters late at night to my mother, in beautiful Chinese calligraphy like that of my newfound sisters. “I dream every day you will return,” Jindo had written her. “When you do, my happiness will be restored.” Advertisement Did she return? Yes, in 1979, after a 30-year separation, my mother went to visit her three daughters. Jindo lived in a village of rice farmers. She had married a surgeon, and they and several comrades served my mother a modest feast in a shack whose walls were lined with newspaper to keep out the cold. When was your first visit? In 1987, my mother, husband and I went together. We stepped out of the plane into an airport painted toothpaste green. I had assumed I would blend in with the masses. Instead, I was surrounded by locals who gawked at me and made open comments about my outlandish purple clothing. These days, I go about once a year. The most gleamingly modern airports I’ve been to are in China. The coolest and most technologically challenging hotel I’ve ever stayed in is in China. The most tricked-out hair salon I’ve been to is in China. The worst pollution I’ve endured is in China. I keep going back for more of the most. Not everyone wants to escape anymore. In fact, it is more often the case that Chinese students go to the U.S. to study and return to start companies and make millions. Has your attitude on China changed? I look at China not as a land of burdens and debt but the land of origin that gave our family its improbable history. I once traveled with Jindo on a long ferry ride to a mansion, the one on the island near Shanghai, where my mother grew up, where Jindo also grew up. I listened to her stories about working in the rice fields, where she wore the conical hat and danced and yelled as she pulled leeches off her calves. She eventually told me what happened to her after our mother left, about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father’s concubine. As Jindo re-enacted the past, she flung her arms and beat her chest, and it must have appeared that we were having a violent argument. “It was not right,” she said repeatedly, and she meant what her stepmother did to her, and also what her father did to our mother, and what my mother did in choosing to be with a lover rather than with her three daughters, and then in marrying that lover and having three children by him, one of them a daughter, who was sitting next to her, listening to her cry. An answer in the Q&A column on Jan. 26, in which the novelist Amy Tan discussed her relationship with China and how it has changed over time, referred incorrectly to a relative in China. Her half-sister married a surgeon, not a “barefoot doctor.” A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2014, on page TR3 of the New York edition with the headline: Amy Tan Reflects on China and Uncovering Secrets of Her Origins.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

Sports   30 Seconds With Boomer Esiason. Advertisement Advertisement By JOE BRESCIAJAN. 27, 2014 After an all-American career at Maryland, Boomer Esiason played 14 seasons in the N.F.L. as a quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times and he was named the league’s most valuable player in 1988. Esiason ended his career with 2,969 completions, 5,205 pass attempts, a 57 percent completion mark , 247 touchdown passes and 37,920 yards passing. In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Business   Wheelies: The Detroit Rising Edition. Advertisement Advertisement By BENJAMIN PRESTONJAN. 28, 2014 A roundup of motoring news from the web: ■ This year’s Detroit auto show reported its highest attendance in more than 10 years. A total of 803,451 people visited the 2014 show — a significant one for General Motors, which took both the North American car and truck of the year awards. Attendance has not been that high since 838,066 people came to the show in 2003. (Jalopnik) ■ In its efforts to get people used to the idea that its new F-150 pickup trucks will be built with aluminum bodies, Ford told its dealers Sunday that the new trucks will actually be cheaper and easier to repair than the outgoing model. Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ BMW says that its all-electric i3 will arrive in American showrooms in May, priced similarly to the 3 Series. Ludwig Willisch, who heads BMW North America, said that the United States would be the company’s largest market for the i Series electric cars, adding that demand for the i3 will most likely outstrip supply in the first year of production. (Bloomberg) Advertisement ■ Volvo and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, of which Volvo is a subsidiary, will jointly develop a small car to compete with the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris and Volkswagen Polo, among others. Engineering work is to be done at a research and development center in Sweden, and Hakan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo, told The Wall Street Journal that the car would be designed to compete in Western markets in a few years. (Automotive News, subscription required) ■ After many races lost to teams with superior equipment, Scuderia Ferrari unveiled its new Formula One racecar on its website over the weekend. The F14 T drops last season’s 2.4-liter V8 in favor of a new turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 and features a lower nose cone and an improved energy recovery system. (CNN) ■ Ralph Marano, a noted Packard collector, is scheduled to take 10 one-of-a-kind Packards this year to the Amelia Island Concours d'Élégance. The show’s organizers agreed to create a class entirely for Mr. Marano’s unique collection of vehicles, which include the Vignale Packard and the Richard Arbib-designed Packard Pan America. (Hemmings Daily) ■ Nissan announced this week its plan to use a 400-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder engine that weighed only 88 pounds in its delta-shaped Le Mans racecar. Nissan claims the engine has a power-to-weight ratio of 10 horsepower per kilogram, which the automaker says is more potent than Formula One’s new 1.6-liter engines.

Business   The Princess Problem. Advertisement This week’s puzzle was suggested by Dave Penneys, a mathematics postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. The Princess Problem A princess lives in a row of seventeen adjacent rooms, each connected by a door to each room next to it. Each room also has a door to the outside. The princess enjoys the rooms but never stays in the same room two days in a row: at the end of each day she moves from the room she occupied to one of the rooms next to it (she chooses randomly). On the first of June a prince arrives from a faraway kingdom to woo the princess. The princess’s guardian explains the habits of the princess and the rules he must follow: Each day he may knock on a single outside door. If the princess is behind it she will open it and meet the prince. If not, the prince gets another chance the next day. Unfortunately the prince must return to his kingdom on July 1. Can he devise a strategy to make sure he meets the princess before then? Give it a try with Gary Hewitt’s remarkable Chase the Princess Gizmo:  That’s it for this week’s challenge.

Foreign   Russians Debate Sticker Price of Sochi Games. Advertisement Advertisement By STEVEN LEE MYERSJAN. 27, 2014 MOSCOW — With less than two weeks to go before the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, the country is finally having a debate — of a sort — over the cost of the event, celebrated as Russia’s triumphal moment on the international stage, yet derided as a bacchanalia of waste and corruption. President Vladimir V. Putin stoked the debate when he recently told a group of television anchors that Russia had spent only 214 billion rubles, or roughly $7 billion, to erect the sporting venues for the games. And less than half of that, he maintained, was government spending. Others, though, say those figures are grossly understated. An organization led by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who has become one of the Kremlin’s most prominent critics, has been working for two months to compile a detailed chronicle of Russia’s Olympic spending, culling figures from annual budgets and corporate reports since 2006. The goal is to document the true cost of the Winter Games in an economy that has slowed considerably, and to focus attention on a debate that has occurred so far only on the fringes of public discourse. The organization, the Foundation for the Fight Against Corruption, is to publish the result of its work on Monday on an interactive website. Mr. Putin’s figure was, Mr. Navalny said, “a lie of an absolutely absurd scale.” It is not only one-tenth of the spending that has been widely reported, but it is also less than the $12 billion Mr. Putin pledged in 2007 to spend on the games when he personally appealed to the International Olympic Committee to choose Sochi as the host. That Russia’s first Winter Olympics would be an expensive undertaking has been a given since the government first broke ground on the projects in and around Sochi, which Mr. Putin called “the biggest building site on the planet.” For the first time, though, the cost issue appears to have become politically sensitive for the Kremlin. Advertisement Officials here once boasted of Russia’s ability to spend so lavishly, but of late they have embraced Mr. Putin’s more frugal tone, and have sought to defend the outlays by redefining what constitutes spending on the Olympics. They have argued that the billions poured into projects like the huge new power plant on the edge of the Olympic Village or the adjacent new railroad station should not be counted as Olympic expenditures, but rather as part of a broader economic stimulus project to rebuild the sea-meets-the-mountains resort on the Black Sea. “It’s just senseless to take the cost of everything built in Sochi — and the building of roads in Sochi — and ascribe it to the Games,” Aleksandr D. Zhukov, the deputy speaker of the lower house of Parliament and the chairman of the Russian Olympic Committee, said in an interview. “Were you in Beijing for the Games? They made boulevards twice as wide — built new roads there. What did that have to do with the Olympics?” KAZAKH. Volgograd UKRAINE Volga River RUSSIA Caspian Sea Sochi Black Sea GEORGIA AZER. ARMENIA 100 Miles To critics like Mr. Navalny, however, Sochi has turned into an unaffordable personal vanity project, intended to cement Mr. Putin’s legacy as the driving force of the country’s restoration after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than two decades ago. Advertisement “It actually seems like some small, spiteful pharaoh is building himself the greatest pyramid in the world,” Mr. Navalny said in his organization’s new headquarters in southeastern Moscow, which hummed late into the evening last week with people still crunching the numbers for the report. “There’s no other way to explain the gigantomania,” he said. According to the group’s calculations, Russia has spent more than 1.5 trillion rubles on the Olympics, which at today’s suddenly declining exchange rate would amount to at least $48 billion — more than China spent for the far larger Summer Olympics in 2008. While that figure is roughly comparable with a $50 billion estimate that Russian officials here disclosed a year ago and then quickly disavowed, the group’s calculations are based on detailed accounting of project costs that have remained largely opaque, perhaps on purpose. The website — in Russian and English — documents thousands of expenses salted through Russian federal budgets since the country first applied to host the games. Mr. Navalny said the work was made difficult by the way spending was scattered in myriad accounts. “There is no single source for the figures,” he said. “Every project requires its own investigation.” Mr. Navalny challenged the Kremlin’s assertions that much of the spending was private, not government. When Mr. Putin said that less than half of the figure he cited was federal money, he sidestepped the fact that many of the largest “private” expenditures were made by companies that are state-owned, like Russian Railways, the state bank and Gazprom, Mr. Navalny said. According to his organization’s analysis, less than 4 percent of the overall spending came from truly private companies. Advertisement Mikhail G. Delyagin, an economist in Moscow, said in an interview that as a rule, the Olympic Games rarely prove to be the engines of economic revival that officials claim. “The situation in Sochi is indeed positive, because there wasn’t even a normal sewer system there,” he said, “but one shouldn’t expect that these resorts will recoup the cost.” Mr. Navalny argued that beyond the most visible projects, like the stadiums and arenas, the government also spent heavily on buildings that had nothing to do with the Olympics or even with future tourism in Sochi. They include new residences for Mr. Putin, a church at the Olympic Village, and resorts for various agencies like the prosecutor’s office and the Federal Security Service, all classified in the annual budgets as Olympic projects. “Under the guise of the Olympics, they made themselves a super-magnificent resort for those who have ended up on the ‘Magnitsky List’ and cannot leave the country,” he said, referring to American sanctions that bar travel and investments abroad for certain Russian officials accused of human-rights abuses. The Sochi Olympics are seen as such a national priority — and a personal one for Mr. Putin — that there has been little official debate about the preparations and the costs. The Parliament has not held hearings. The state auditing chamber has compiled a report on spending, but it has not disclosed its findings and would not do so until after the Games, a spokesman said. What criticism there has been of the spending has come from a handful of news organizations and bloggers. Online critics in particular have enthusiastically questioned the building projects and the chronic delays, delved into accusations of cronyism and corruption and mocked absurdities they uncovered. Recently, there was the matter of the men’s room that was observed and photographed by Steve Rosenberg, a BBC journalist, during a visit to the Laura Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center in the mountains above Sochi. In a single, sleekly tiled bathroom stall were not one but two toilets, side by side. The image seemed a pas de deux of either poor design and Olympian waste that, for a fleeting moment at least, became a symbol of the entire endeavor. Boris E. Nemtsov, another prominent opposition leader who has written extensively about corruption in the Olympic project, said the Kremlin wanted to now revise Sochi’s budget because of fear of popular outrage and even prosecution, though the latter seems unlikely. “So they shamelessly underestimate the expenses so that people don’t become indignant, and instead say that all we have is like in Canada,” he wrote this week on the website of the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy. Andrey Miroshnichenko, an independent media analyst, questioned whether Mr. Navalny’s report would at last spur a meaningful political debate, and noted that excessive spending and corruption are taken for granted in Russia. “Everyone knows how business is done here,” he said. “Expensiveness is considered a way to redistribute the state’s wealth.” Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president and now prime minister, acknowledged in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the larger figure of nearly $50 billion was accurate, but he disputed accusations of excessive waste or corruption. “There is no data on whether the corruption related to the Olympics,” he explained, “is much higher than the average level of corruption in the country.” An earlier version of the picture caption atop this article misspelled the name of the cross-country ski and biathlon center. It is the Laura ski center, not Lauea. Andrew Roth contributed reporting.

Science   Me Versus the Scale Sign Up for the Running Email. Advertisement The scale and I have reached détente. That is: I leave it alone, and it affords me the same courtesy. I rarely step on it, and we’re both better off. I have earned the right of refusal. As someone who weighed herself almost daily between the ages of 10 and 25, who spent six years at fat camps and traveled around the Middle East with a scale buried in the pit of her backpack (I know, I know…), I’ve done my time. I won’t even weigh myself at the doctor’s office. Nothing good can come from the knowledge that I’m three pounds lighter, or two pounds heavier. “People are obsessed with it — they go crazy over a tenth of a pound,” said Jim White, a registered dietitian nutritionist and a spokesman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I’ve had clients who are losing major inches and body fat and looking and feeling great, but if the scale doesn’t budge they get defeated. The number defines them.” I had pretty much been blessedly scale-free until a few months ago, when I signed up for a month-long, twice-weekly fitness class. Shedding pounds was not my goal; I just wanted a good, hard workout. The instructor insisted on taking our “before” and “after” measurements, including our weight and body fat percentages. I balked, but after the teacher promised “I won’t tell you what it is,” I held my breath and shuffled onto the scale as if to the guillotine. I was curious, of course, but I squeezed my eyes shut and didn’t peek. And that was the end of that — until a week later, when I opened a group email from her and found a list of the entire class’s names, along with our weights and measurements. A ball of rubber bands wove its way from my stomach and lodged in my throat. “Really?” I thought. It seemed a major violation. So many of us can recite the intimate details of our friends’ sex lives, their pharmacological habits, their rents. But question their weights and their mouths clamp shut. Not even the N.S.A. knows that. “How often do we ask someone what they weigh? Unless you really know them well, you don’t,” said Allan Geliebter, a senior researcher at The New York Obesity Nutrition Research Center at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center. “The last thing you tell someone is that they gained a lot of weight.” After stewing about it, I realized that I didn’t really care if 15 strangers knew my weight. I just didn’t want to know — especially since it was about five pounds higher than I would have liked. It haunted me. The teacher apologized. But, she said, the weight was “just a number.” “The real thing you should worry about is body fat.” Indeed, most experts agree that body fat percentage is a better indicator of health than overall weight, with obesity often defined as greater than 25 percent body fat in men and 35 percent in women. Belly, or visceral, fat can be more harmful than the subcutaneous fat found directly under the skin and stored in the thighs and derriere — neither of which a traditional scale gauges. “Weight in itself is an imperfect measurement of health,” said Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. “Someone who is 30 pounds overweight and has mainly a pear shape can be pretty healthy. You can be an apple shape and 30 pounds overweight and have diabetes.” A quicker and more accurate assessment, he said, is measuring waist circumference — more than 35 inches for women or more than 40 inches for men is problematic — or using calipers to determine the amount of fat under the skin. Those measurements tend to be more reliable than body mass index, or B.M.I., which doesn’t distinguish between fatty and lean tissue or take body shape into consideration. So if the scale is such a flawed measure, why is it still so widely used? “It can be an effective tool,” said Jennifer Linde, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, in Minneapolis. “It gives you feedback every day, and you can coach people to look at the number as a neutral thing. It doesn’t have to be a value judgment.” Presuming it’s possible to look at it as a “neutral” thing, some studies have shown that the more frequently you weigh yourself the better off you are, at least in terms of weight control. A six-month study of overweight and obese adults who were looking to lose weight, published last September in Obesity, confirmed that sentiment. During the study, which included a mobile scale for daily weighing, a web-based weight loss graph and weekly feedback from researchers, participants who weighed themselves daily lost 13 pounds on average. Those in the other group, who weighed themselves weekly, lost nothing. David A. Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University who has conducted studies on the efficacy of daily weighing since 1992, believes that daily self-weighing is necessary to help prevent weight gain. “I don’t see any way that we are going to tax fats or tax soda or have people exercise more in order to control their weight,” he said. “There’s enough data to show that doesn’t work. But if you step on that scale first thing in the morning, that’s protective of those subtle cues in our environment that make us eat a little more than we expend.” The best news, at least for us scale avoiders, is that most medical professionals agree that self-monitoring — whether it is counting calories, writing down how much one eats or weighing oneself regularly — is the greatest predictor of success. Our task is to choose the thing that makes us the least crazy, and stick with it. And that is why, in the end, I skipped getting weighed at my last exercise class. There was no reason to. I felt stronger, my clothes fit better, and that was enough for me.

Sports   30 Seconds With Boomer Esiason. Advertisement Advertisement By JOE BRESCIAJAN. 27, 2014 After an all-American career at Maryland, Boomer Esiason played 14 seasons in the N.F.L. as a quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals. He was selected to the Pro Bowl four times and he was named the league’s most valuable player in 1988. Esiason ended his career with 2,969 completions, 5,205 pass attempts, a 57 percent completion mark , 247 touchdown passes and 37,920 yards passing. In 1995, the N.F.L. honored Esiason with the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award in recognition of his excellence on the football field as well as his charitable work through the Boomer Esiason Foundation, which is dedicated to curing cystic fibrosis, and other organizations. After retiring in 1997, he became a commentator for ABC’s “Monday Night Football.” Esiason, 52, currently is a commentator for Westwood One/CBS Radio Sports’ “Monday Night Football” and is a studio analyst for “The NFL Today,” CBS’s pregame show. Along with Craig Carton, he co-hosts WFAN’s weekday morning radio show, “Boomer and Carton in the Morning.” For the next week, Esiason’s life will be full of football and funny. On Jan. 29, Esiason and Carton will M.C. the WFAN Super Comedy Jam at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Then on Jan. 30, Esiason will be roasted by the Friar’s Club to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation, the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program and The N.Y./N.J. Snowflake Youth Foundation. Advertisement Q. Why will Denver win the Super Bowl? A. Denver will win because Peyton Manning is on a mission and in order to fulfill his total mission of vindication and validation, he will finish off a most amazing season by not only winning the Super Bowl for the second time, but also adding the Super Bowl M.V.P. to his N.F.L. regular season M.V.P. Q. Why will Seattle win? A. Seattle will win because Marshawn Lynch and their defense can win in inclement weather. The whipping winds at Met Life Stadium will wreak havoc on the N.F.L.'s best ever passing offense. Advertisement Q. Who do think will win? A. Depends on the weather. If it is a calm day with minimal winds, then Denver; but if it’s a day like Tuesday (snowstorm) today, then Seattle. Q. What do you think about all the trash talking, most recently with Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree? A. I completely understand the intense nature of the competition on the field. This has been going on for years. It’s so much more prevalent these days because of the intense social media following of the league and its players. When you combine that with the extreme overexposure from the networks in high-def camera, it’s there for all the world to see and opine on. I believe the league has sent out memos to both the referees and all coaches that continued behavior of this sort will be held accountable for via fines. The last thing the N.F.L. wants to see is what we all saw during the postgame interview conducted on Fox with Richard Sherman. It was an extremely embarrassing moment for the league, the Seahawks and Sherman himself. Q. Do you agree with the Jets giving Rex Ryan a contract extension? A. I agree 100 percent with the Jets decision to reward Rex Ryan with a contract extension albeit lukewarm. His extension is tied to incentives so that, if things go wrong next year, the Jets can fire him without significant monetary penalties. I think it’s a healthy compromise between coach and new general manager, John Idzik, to make sure this past season’s 8-8 record was not an aberration. I also believe that continuity and consistency are two main ingredients for a franchise’s long-term success. Paramount to that success is the support towards a young, up and coming quarterback. Q. Should the Jets stick with Geno Smith or draft another quarterback? A. Only internally do the Jets know if Geno has the ability to flourish in the complex world of being an N.F.L. quarterback. From the outside, Smith showed flashes that he could be the long-term solution. What was most impressive, even in the midst of some poor performances on a back-to-back basis, was that Smith was able to rebound with two strong performances in the team’s final two games. In other words, he has made it very difficult for the Jets to have 100 percent confidence that he is the long-term answer. Q. Who do you think will be let go first, Rex Ryan or Tom Coughlin? A. Let me start this by saying that I hope neither one gets let go, but since Coach Coughlin is the proud owner of two of the most improbable Super Bowl victories in history, I would think that Rex Ryan is on thinner ice. Advertisement Q. What do you think about the proposed concussion settlement that was recently rejected by a federal judge? A. Full disclosure. I was not a party to the original suit. But as a former N.F.L. player, I stand to gain from the ultimate agreement. I wondered aloud on my morning show at WFAN about whether or not the initial settlement would be enough. And, why in the world would the players agree to not holding their universities or the N.C.A.A. responsible for potential physical problems that could have occurred while playing in college? And while the total number now remains in dispute, I believe the N.F.L. and the initial plaintiffs could agree on an initial down-payment of $250 million to be made immediately to help those players that desperately need the support today. Q. How do you think the top quarterbacks in the draft - Johnny Manziel, Teddy Bridgewater, Blake Bortles and Derek Carr - will do in the N.F.L.? A. Trying to translate the college game to the pro game with regard to young quarterbacks is one of the most difficult decisions to be made. While every quarterback has the physical measurables needed to succeed, it is the intangibles, such as dealing with adversity and criticism, that separate the successful ones from the failures. Each one of these young men will be given the opportunity of a lifetime, based solely on their performance in college. And then it is up to them to decide if they want to become Peyton Manning or end up like Ryan Leaf. Q. What do you think about the recent group of head coaches hired? A. Unfortunately, the N.F.L. is a world of retreads and dysfunction. So much depends on whether or not the new coach has a quarterback to build around. And if they can’t find that guy it really doesn’t matter what their background is. At least last year, the Philadelphia Eagles thought outside the box with the hiring of Chip Kelly. At this moment, I see more Andy Reid-type situations in the N.F.L. as opposed to what the Eagles did, which ultimately means more of the same. Q. You’re going to be roasted by the Friar’s Club on Jan. 30 to benefit the Boomer Esiason Foundation and the Gift of Laughter Wounded Warrior Program. Who on the dais do you think will give you the harshest treatment? A. I say C.C. (Carton), Sam Wyche, Bill Cowher and Jay Mohr. One thing they have in common, there’s no way that they would’ve been a success without me. Q. Tell me something nobody knows about Carton, your funny and feisty WFAN partner? A. Because Craig is so entertaining and so smart and knows how to get under the skin of sports fans, many people don’t realize how great of a father he is. I could easily nominate C.C. for Father of the Year, every year since the day I met him. Go to Home Page »
Travel   Budget-Friendly and (Almost) Dracula-Free Transylvania. Advertisement Advertisement Seth Kugel FRUGAL TRAVELER JAN. 27, 2014 “Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things,” said a certain sharp-fanged count to his English visitor, freshly arrived by train to Transylvania. In some sense, things haven’t changed much since Bram Stoker published those words in 1897. I arrived by train myself in mid-January and I, too, found strange things: A picture-perfect medieval town square packed not with tourists but primary school students. “Bagel” shops that don’t sell bagels. An Eastern Orthodox priest denouncing guitar lessons and raising bees. Look, I fully intended to experience and write about Transylvania with no mention of vampires or anything described in novel by an Irishman who had never visited the region. I even requested that Twitter followers tracking my travels abstain from Dracula-related remarks. That’s because the real place — now a large swath of central and western Romania and almost certainly the place on earth most commonly mistaken for fictional — is mountainous and beautiful, its ancient towns lively and well preserved, its ethnic and political history rich and complex. In other words, a place well worth discovering in its own right, not digressing to mentions of scary monsters. Advertisement That worked until I was taking money from an A.T.M. in the scrupulously well-preserved medieval center of Sighisoara. Glancing up, I saw the sign: “Banca Transilvania” — and realized I was down the block from a medieval clock tower with torture chamber beneath; across the street was the house where Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Draculae, is said to have been born in 1431. A chill went down my spine. In my head, well trained since “Sesame Street” and “Scooby Doo” days in how vampires operate, organ music played, and lightning crackled. I had come to Transylvania in the winter knowing that I would be sacrificing the mountain hikes and farm stays popular among summer visitors — but hoping to find cheaper prices, snow-dusted castles and perhaps a day of skiing. And soul-satisfying food: If there was ever a dish made for post-slope replenishment, it’s Romanian ciorba de burta, the cream-based tripe soup that is rich, ubiquitous and cheap. Alas, there had been no snow for a month, which meant no skiing, no fairy-tale dusting of ancient roofs. Still, having medieval towns and villages of Transylvania to yourself has its advantages. In Brasov, the 250,000-person city where I spent a day, that meant being the lone person gawking at the 16th-century Black Church, framing photographs through old city gates, and wondering at how just about every building in town is marked “Monument Istoric”. Still, some were more obviously Istoric than others. Wandering narrow side streets I fell for a tiny 1837 home with an intricately carved wooden door and faux Corinthian columns bordering the windows; in front of it was a Romanian-made Dacia car propped up half on the sidewalk to allow traffic to pass. The brisk winter temperatures made me more appreciative of bakeries selling warm-from-the-oven breads. In Brasov, I stopped at a shop called Bagel Magic, which in fact serves warm covrigi, which are like bagels Photoshopped like a celebrity for a cover photo — from pudgy and irregular to slender yet curvaceous (without, thankfully, airbrushing out the poppy seeds). Mine cost 1.5 lei, or 45 cents at 3.25 lei to the dollar. In Sighisoara, young and old lined up in the rain to pay one leu for truly piping-hot covrigi at the sales window of Gigi. Brasov is the traditional home base for visits to two castles in the region: Bran and Peles. They could not be more different. Bran Castle is probably the most touristy spot in Transylvania thanks to its completely dubious connections with both the fictional and historic Dracula. But with summer hordes replaced by a handful of Romanian tourists and a school field trip, I quite enjoyed the visit (the 25-lei admission price didn’t hurt). Perched almost precariously on the side of a hill, the castle — which once served as a toll collector’s headquarters and a defense post against Ottoman aggressors — truly seems like the sort of place a vampire might have lived. In fact, I found out, the home was last used as a residence by the Romanian royal family before it was seized by the Communist government, and it is decorated largely from that period. (Although on the higher levels, things did get a tiny bit creepy — up there, where wind swirled and whistled outside, I came upon some restrained displays about Dracula.) Peles Castle is a wholly different and entirely more mind-boggling experience. Built by King Carol I as a summer residence beginning in 1873, its lavish halls are filled with endlessly ornate detail, like a Versailles for the late 19th century: Carol seems to have spared no expense in the Arab and Turkish-themed rooms; his astoundingly vast European arms collection — swords, battle axes, guns — is displayed in all its excess in one hall, along with a full-on man and horse armor display that will leave no medieval fantasist unhappy. In an adjoining room is his collection of Ottoman and Persian arms, so flowery and ornate by comparison that they look runway-ready for Constantinople Fashion Week. Still, Sighisoara, under three hours from Brasov by train (and free for me, as it was the first leg of my already-purchased return trip to Budapest), was the highlight. I’m very picky about medieval walled towns, having skewered places from Dubrovnik, Croatia, to Èze, France, as little more than polished museum pieces. But unlike those places (and true to what guidebooks said), Sighisoara is truly living medieval town, its 16th- through 18th-century homes largely still inhabited. When I stopped into a place called the Medieval Cafe for a 5-lei warm winter drink made of black currants, I could hear children playing in the neighboring schoolyard; I would later see the same kids rushing out of school in the square in front of the clock tower, which in many other places would be strictly tourist territory. Advertisement The city walls are guarded over by eclectic watchtowers, each maintained by (and named for) a different guild of historic craftsmen — tailors, tanners, cobblers, furriers, rope makers. But the clock tower is the true fairy-tale attraction. It was first built in the 13th and 14th centuries; a Baroque roof was added in the 17th century, along with its most charming element, seven figurines based on Greek and Roman gods that rotate each day of the week. From the belvedere at the top (which you reach through the creaky-floored museum, 12 lei) you get a remarkable 360-degree view of the city; astonishingly, I could spot barely a single building, even in the more modern lower city, that appeared to have been built in the 20th or 21st century. Eager to see the much-touted Carpathian villages, I rented a car (I paid in euros, the equivalent of $33 a day) and drove out to the rural villages, many of which feature impressive fortified Saxon churches. That Saxon population, which once dominated many of the villages, has since largely evacuated to Germany, replaced by Romanians, Hungarians and Roma, the three largest ethnic groups in Transylvania today. (For those wondering, the last Romanian census counted zero vampires, though admittedly was largely taken in the daylight.) After passing through Biertan, whose church was closed and residents not very chatty, I found a warmer reception a mile or so away in Copsa Mare. In the local magazin mixt — the cool Romanian term for convenience store — a woman used hand gestures to explain that I should knock at the house next to the church; there, an adolescent boy fetched the key and led me through its battered arched doorway. The old church wasn’t anything special, although the experience of getting into it had been. So I left a donation in the bowl and took off to wander the town. It was a village of dirt roads and modest, mostly Saxon-style houses; I noticed nothing out of the ordinary except several young girls carrying around guitars. When a young man pulling buckets of water from a well spoke to me in near perfect English, I asked him about the guitars. “There’s a lady in the town who is teaching the children,” he said. “Great!” I said. He did not agree. He was the town’s Orthodox priest, and the guitar lessons, he said, were an effort to recruit families to the Pentecostal church in town. He introduced himself as John (his name is actually Ioan Bico) and seemed delighted to entertain me for the next few hours. He may have been a priest, but he wielded a sharp tongue recounting an opinionated chapter of the town’s recent ethnic history. To summarize: the Saxons used to refuse to marry Romanians, yet when they moved to Germany, the men found themselves discriminated against and returned to marry not only Romanians but even the more-maligned Roma. (He called them Gypsies, and they were not spared maligning from him either.) Advertisement He eventually invited me over for a beer — nonalcoholic for me, he insisted, since I was driving — and to see the icons he paints and sells to supplement his meager pay. He was also a beekeeper, and I happily bought a jar of honey for 20 lei. Conversation ranged from Hollywood to the Internet to birth control and abortion. (He did not think highly of any of the four.) I had not eaten since breakfast, so I headed back to Sighisoara in search of a reasonably priced meal. Finding the pub-like Cafe Martini near the town center, I ordered a feast as most customers just drank beer and listened to a soundtrack lost in the ‘80s (Springsteen, Tina Turner, Asia). I had that tripe soup called ciorba de burta, mititei (grilled ground meat patties), cascaval pane (breaded, fried cheese), and the great Romanian dessert of papanasi (hot doughnuts, topped with sour cream and currant jam) — and returned, stuffed, to my guesthouse. I was staying at Casa Soare, a family-run pension in the lower town, a 10-minute walk down from the citadel, where I had scored a winter discount at 80 lei a night — about 20 percent off the Booking.com price — by calling in advance. It was a nice place and worth the modest expense, but I had two lodging regrets. The first — that I had not stayed in a village or on a farm — was unavoidable: Most rural guesthouses were closed for the winter. But I realized I had missed an opportunity when I picked up my rental car at Casa Baroca, just down the block from the Vlad Dracul house. I got a tour of the place, and it was amazing. Entering through the 300 year-old front door, I found rooms under vaulted ceilings decorated with traditional furniture, antique wood stoves, old wood floors. And winter prices were only slightly more than what I was paying: 100 lei, down from 140 in summer. Advertisement Still, perhaps I was better off at my place. Staying at Casa Baroca, I had learned, would be in violation of a town ordinance forbidding foreigners to lodge in the citadel. Admittedly, the law was written around 1515 and is probably not still in effect, but in a city with a torture chamber, you can’t be too careful.

Ford said that the aluminum bodies are set up in a modular design — as opposed to the welded design of the old steel trucks — that simplifies repairs by making them less time-consuming. (Reuters) ■ In other F-150-related news, Ford says that the new 2.7-liter V6 the automaker introduced with the new pickup has a unique two-piece engine block. Most engines are either all aluminum or all cast iron, but Ford’s new engine has an upper part — housing the cylinder bores — made from compacted graphite iron and a lower half made from aluminum. The unusual construction allowed Ford to make the engine very small; it is only 18 inches long from front to back.

Foreign   A Dynast’s Flailing Makeover. Advertisement   NEW DELHI — In September, Rahul Gandhi, vice president of the Congress Party and scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, made an unannounced public appearance at a news conference in New Delhi. Minutes previously, Mr. Gandhi had called up Ajay Maken, the party’s general secretary, to ask him his whereabouts. Now, as Mr. Maken was defending a controversial government ordinance that prevented convicted politicians from being removed from office Mr. Gandhi seized the microphone. “I think the ordinance is complete nonsense,” he said. “It should be torn up and thrown away.” Mr. Gandhi’s outburst left Mr. Maken, and most senior leaders of the Congress Party, stunned. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, away in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly, had to face a public humiliation, hours before an important meeting with President Obama. It is inconceivable that the ordinance, which sparked an instant backlash from the media and the public, could have been passed without Mr. Gandhi’s knowledge. Yet, once he had taken note of the public mood, Mr. Gandhi seized the moment to engineer a shift in how he was seen by the Indian electorate. Mr. Gandhi, the ultimate insider in Indian politics, was now refashioning himself as an outside agent of change. That shift had been necessitated, in large part, by the steady and growing unpopularity of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. It is impossible to judge whether his outburst in September was an impulsive decision or a carefully calculated move. But it is clear that Mr. Gandhi increasingly feels the need to come across as accessible, articulate and decisive. His decision to subject himself to his first-ever television interview, with a popular network that aired the exchange Monday night, was a step in the same direction. Until his remarks in September, Mr. Gandhi had sought to cultivate the image of a leader who shunned public attention and preferred to work inconspicuously behind the scenes. In 2005, during an interview to the newsmagazine Tehelka, it was put to Mr. Gandhi that he asked few questions in Parliament. “I don’t ask questions in Parliament because I like to think things through,” he had replied. Mr. Gandhi portrayed himself as a politician unwilling to engage with the distracting minutiae of everyday politics. He was instead working on a grand design of resuscitating the Congress Party, democratizing the organization at the grass-roots and reinventing India’s oldest political party for the 21st century. It was an impression that Mr. Gandhi cultivated for much of his early years in politics. In the raucous and frenetic world of Indian politics, Mr. Gandhi remained ensconced in a long and seemingly intense silence. For fleeting observers of Indian democracy, it may have seemed that Mr. Gandhi alone was thinking about the great, profound and significant questions of our time. The thinking though was rarely, if ever, evident to his countrymen, to whom he remained little beyond an enigma. His thoughts on the most vexing questions of the day remained unrecorded for the electorate. But as long as the central government enjoyed some degree of modest popularity, Mr. Gandhi could always partake some of the credit, though his own contributions to policy making and other aspects of the government remained vague and undefined. A change in strategy became imperative once it became clear that it would be politically unwise for Mr. Gandhi, who was certain to lead the Congress Party into the next elections, to align himself too closely with a deeply unpopular government. His own failures in reviving the fortunes of the Congress in the key states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also meant that a new direction was needed to ignite Mr. Gandhi’s appeal for the electorate. Mr. Gandhi would have to be remade for public consumption, and so he began the process of fashioning himself as the crusading outsider last fall. Another factor, one outside Mr. Gandhi’s control, may have played a part too. In a country, where ideas of citizenship and egalitarian democracy are deepening, being the embodiment of dynastic and feudal privilege is a greater liability than ever before in Indian politics. In his televised interview on Monday night, Mr. Gandhi continued to play the crusader. He did not have a hunger for power, he asserted; instead he was in politics to “change the system.” Mr. Gandhi’s interview was, in many ways, a bumbling and bizarre performance. His depth of engagement with critical issues looked uncertain. Posed with specific questions, Mr. Gandhi repeatedly sought to seek refuge in vague, and seemingly rehearsed, generalities. When asked his views of Narendra Modi, the opposition’s candidate for prime minister, Mr. Gandhi responded, “What Rahul Gandhi wants to do, is Rahul Gandhi and millions of youngsters in this country want to change the way the system in this country works. What Rahul Gandhi wants to do is empower the women in this country, wants to unleash the power of these women, I mean we talk about being a superpower …” The interview also delineated the very real limits of Mr. Gandhi’s outsider act. When asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, after the assassination of his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and perpetrated under the watch of his father, Rajiv Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi sought to mount a dubious distinction between the pogrom in 1984 and the anti-Muslim riots of 2002 in Gujarat, which took place while Mr. Modi was chief minister of the state. Contrary to established evidence by independent human rights groups that indicts both governments of active collusion, Mr. Gandhi stated, “In 1984, the government was trying to stop the riots. In 2002, the government was actively aiding and abetting the riots.” If Mr. Gandhi had hoped to come across to undecided voters as the catalyst for change, he failed. But most alarmingly for supporters of the Congress Party, Mr. Gandhi’s interview revealed that despite a decade in politics, he had little to offer that was substantive and novel. Despite an active “rebranding” exercise, Mr. Gandhi reinforced the impression of a reluctant politician, inspired by little more than feudal obligation to carry forward the family business.
